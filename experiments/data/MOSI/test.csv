61,8.0,LIKE WHAT TO EXPECT FROM MILEY CYRUS UM I MEAN SHES ONLY DONE THE HANNAH MONTANA FRANCHISE PLAYING THAT ONE CHARACTER WHICH I THINK LIKE 99 OF THE PERCENT OF THE TIME HER CHARACTERS LIKE SO OVERBOARD SHES SO EXAGGERATED SO I REALLY DIDNT KNOW HOW SHE WAS GOING TO HANDLE THIS FILM,tIrG4oNLFzE,-1.2

68,15.0,BUT AS AN ACTOR I REALLY THINK ESPECIALLY AN ACTOR IN THE LEAD LEADING ROLE YOU REALLY SHOULD PREPARE FOR THAT ROLE,tIrG4oNLFzE,-2.0
69,16.0,I WAS LIKE HOW CAN YOU GO INTO A FILM INTO A LEADING ROLE AND HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOUR CHARACTER IS,tIrG4oNLFzE,-1.6

941,1.0,POOP,VCslbP0mgZI,-2.5
942,2.0,MUSIC IN BACKGROUND LAUGHING CURRENTLY IN THEATRES STARRING NO ONE YOUVE EVER HEARD OF,VCslbP0mgZI,-0.6
943,3.0,GUARDIANS OF OWL LAND WHATEVER THAT CAME OUT AND I NEVER SAW IT,VCslbP0mgZI,0.0
944,4.0,AND THIS SUCKERS GETTING THIS SUCKER IS GETTING PANNED LIKE LAST AIRBENDER GARBAGE PANNED AND I WANNA SAY THIS I DID NOT THINK IT WAS LIKE LAST AIRBENDER GARBAGE,VCslbP0mgZI,-2.6
945,5.0, UM HERES WHY YES STUTTERING T THERES PROBLEMS WITH THIS AND I WANNA TALK ABOUT THEM BUT YOU KNOW IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL,VCslbP0mgZI,0.4
946,6.0, THERE ARE SOME REALLY COOL UH MOMENTS IN THIS,VCslbP0mgZI,2.0
947,7.0,IT ACTUALLY HAS SOME SOME THEM THEMATICALLY IT HAS SOME COOL THEMES ABOUT HEROISM AND ABOUT LIKE TAKING OWNERSHIP OF YOURSELF AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH I RESONATED WITH AND I WHI AND WHICH I APPRECIATED,VCslbP0mgZI,1.8
948,8.0,BUT HERES THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE THE ESSENTAIL PROBLEM OF THIS MOVIE WELL MAYBE THIS WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT UM THERE WAS A UH A COMEDIAN NAMED DAVE CHAPELLE UM AND DAVE CHAPELLE UM AND ANOTHER COMEDIAN CHRIS ROCK ARE UM AFRICAN AMERICAN AND IN THEIR COMEDY THEY SOMETIMES TAKE ON AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE AND SO THEY WILL ESSENTIALLY MAKE FUN OF BLACK PEOPLE AND THE THING WITH DAVE CHAPELLE AND WITH CHRIS ROCK IS BECAUSE THEYRE BLACK THEY CAN KINDA DO THAT AND THERES SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THATS ACCEPTABLE,VCslbP0mgZI,-1.6
949,9.0,UM IF LIKE ME OR LAUGHING SOME OTHER WHITE PERSON OR HISPANIC PERSON OR WHATEVER DID THE SAME JOKES IT WOULD NOT BE FUNNY,VCslbP0mgZI,-2.0
950,10.0, IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE IN FACT IT WOULD BE RACIST,VCslbP0mgZI,-2.2
951,11.0,SO ZACH SNYDER HERE IS MAKING A MOVIE THATS OSTENSIBLY ABOUT FEMALE EMPOW EMPOWERMENT BUT ITS A MOVIE ABOUT FEMALE EMPOWERMENT WHICH INCLUDES A LOT OF CLEARING THROAT SLAPPING THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF WOMEN IN BUSTIERS THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF VIOLENCE DONE AGAINST WOMEN AND ULTIMATELY IN WHICH MOST OF THE WOMEN END UP COMPLETELY DISEMPOWERED,VCslbP0mgZI,-2.6
952,12.0, CLAPPING LAUGHING SO OKAY IF ZACH SNYDER WERE A WOMAN I WOULD SAY OKAY SHES MAKING A COMMENT ABOUT THE WAY WOMEN CANT BE EMPOWERED IN MALE DOMINATED SOCIETIES IN THE WAY MEN UM DISTRACT AND AND HURT AND DAMAGE WOMEN AND PREVENT THEM FROM ASSERTING WHO THEY REALLY ARE,VCslbP0mgZI,-0.4
953,13.0, I COULD KINDA SEE THAT IN A SORT OF CHRIS ROCK DAVE CHAPELLE WAY,VCslbP0mgZI,1.0
954,14.0,BUT ZACH SNYDER IS A GUY AND BECAUSE OF THAT THIS STUFF KINDA ENDS UP LOOKING LIKE THE SH HE MAN WOMAN HATERS CLUB,VCslbP0mgZI,-1.6
955,15.0, SO IF I GIVE ZACH SNYDER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THIS IS A MOVIE THAT LOOKS GREAT HAS SOME BAD ACTING,VCslbP0mgZI,0.4
956,16.0,AND HAS WAY TOO MUCH VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN,VCslbP0mgZI,-1.8
957,17.0, IF I DONT GIVE ZACH SNYDER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ,VCslbP0mgZI,-0.6
958,1.0,NOW THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE BASICALLY SAYS IT ALL,0h-zjBukYpk,-0.4

972,15.0,BUT ITS PRETTY SELFEXPLANATORY,0h-zjBukYpk,0.0
973,16.0, UM I ACTUALLY THINK THAT LIEV SCHREIBER IS A GOOD ACTOR,0h-zjBukYpk,0.6
974,17.0,AND HE ALMOST LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THIS CHARACTER IN DEFIANCE,0h-zjBukYpk,0.2
975,18.0, I MEAN IT WAS LIKE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO TAKE OFF THE COSTUME OR SOMETHING,0h-zjBukYpk,-2.0
976,19.0,NOW OTHER PERFORMANCES ARE BORDERLINE,0h-zjBukYpk,-0.4
977,20.0, OK BUT THE TWO BIG CHARACTER APPEARANCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE EASILY DEADPOOL AND GAMBIT,0h-zjBukYpk,0.6
978,21.0, ACTUALLY I LIKED HIM A LOT,0h-zjBukYpk,2.0
979,22.0, AND I THOUGHT HE MADE A GOOD ACTOR FOR THE DEAD POOR CHARACTER,0h-zjBukYpk,1.8
980,23.0, NOW HES SEEN AT THE BEGINNING THAT REALLY SOLD ME,0h-zjBukYpk,2.6
981,24.0,I MEAN THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE ,0h-zjBukYpk,2.6
