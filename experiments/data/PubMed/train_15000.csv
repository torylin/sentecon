0,OBJECTIVE,"To investigate the efficacy of 6 weeks of daily low-dose oral prednisolone in improving pain , mobility , and systemic low-grade inflammation in the short term and whether the effect would be sustained at 12 weeks in older adults with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) ."
1,METHODS,A total of 125 patients with primary knee OA were randomized 1:1 ; 63 received 7.5 mg/day of prednisolone and 62 received placebo for 6 weeks .
2,METHODS,Outcome measures included pain reduction and improvement in function scores and systemic inflammation markers .
3,METHODS,Pain was assessed using the visual analog pain scale ( 0-100 mm ) .
4,METHODS,"Secondary outcome measures included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores , patient global assessment ( PGA ) of the severity of knee OA , and 6-min walk distance ( 6MWD ) ."
5,METHODS,"Serum levels of interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - , and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) were measured ."
6,RESULTS,"There was a clinically relevant reduction in the intervention group compared to the placebo group for knee pain , physical function , PGA , and 6MWD at 6 weeks ."
7,RESULTS,"The mean difference between treatment arms ( 95 % CI ) was 10.9 ( 4.8-18 .0 ) , p < 0.001 ; 9.5 ( 3.7-15 .4 ) , p < 0.05 ; 15.7 ( 5.3-26 .1 ) , p < 0.001 ; and 86.9 ( 29.8-144 .1 ) , p < 0.05 , respectively ."
8,RESULTS,"Further , there was a clinically relevant reduction in the serum levels of IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF - , and hsCRP at 6 weeks in the intervention group when compared to the placebo group ."
9,RESULTS,These differences remained significant at 12 weeks .
10,RESULTS,The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International responder rate was 65 % in the intervention group and 34 % in the placebo group ( p < 0.05 ) .
11,CONCLUSIONS,"Low-dose oral prednisolone had both a short-term and a longer sustained effect resulting in less knee pain , better physical function , and attenuation of systemic inflammation in older patients with knee OA ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01619163 ) ."
12,BACKGROUND,Emotional eating is associated with overeating and the development of obesity .
13,BACKGROUND,"Yet , empirical evidence for individual ( trait ) differences in emotional eating and cognitive mechanisms that contribute to eating during sad mood remain equivocal ."
14,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to test if attention bias for food moderates the effect of self-reported emotional eating during sad mood ( vs neutral mood ) on actual food intake .
15,OBJECTIVE,It was expected that emotional eating is predictive of elevated attention for food and higher food intake after an experimentally induced sad mood and that attentional maintenance on food predicts food intake during a sad versus a neutral mood .
16,METHODS,Participants ( N = 85 ) were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental mood induction conditions ( sad/neutral ) .
17,METHODS,Attentional biases for high caloric foods were measured by eye tracking during a visual probe task with pictorial food and neutral stimuli .
18,METHODS,Self-reported emotional eating was assessed with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire ( DEBQ ) and ad libitum food intake was tested by a disguised food offer .
19,RESULTS,Hierarchical multivariate regression modeling showed that self-reported emotional eating did not account for changes in attention allocation for food or food intake in either condition .
20,RESULTS,"Yet , attention maintenance on food cues was significantly related to increased intake specifically in the neutral condition , but not in the sad mood condition ."
21,CONCLUSIONS,"The current findings show that self-reported emotional eating ( based on the DEBQ ) might not validly predict who overeats when sad , at least not in a laboratory setting with healthy women ."
22,CONCLUSIONS,"Results further suggest that attention maintenance on food relates to eating motivation when in a neutral affective state , and might therefore be a cognitive mechanism contributing to increased food intake in general , but maybe not during sad mood ."
23,BACKGROUND,"Although working smoke alarms halve deaths in residential fires , many households do not keep alarms operational ."
24,BACKGROUND,We tested whether theory-based education increases alarm operability .
25,METHODS,"Randomised multiarm trial , with a single arm randomly selected for use each day , in low-income neighbourhoods in Maryland , USA ."
26,METHODS,Intervention arms : ( 1 ) Full Education combining a health belief module with a social-cognitive theory module that provided hands-on practice installing alarm batteries and using the alarm 's hush button ; ( 2 ) Hands-on Practice social-cognitive module supplemented by typical fire department education ; ( 3 ) Current Norm receiving typical fire department education only .
27,METHODS,Four hundred and thirty-six homes recruited through churches or by knocking on doors in 2005-2008 .
28,METHODS,Follow-up visits checked alarm operability in 370 homes ( 85 % ) 1-3 .5 years after installation .
29,METHODS,number of homes with working alarms defined as alarms with working batteries or hard-wired and number of working alarms per home .
30,METHODS,Regressions controlled for alarm status preintervention ; demographics and beliefs about fire risks and alarm effectiveness .
31,RESULTS,"Homes in the Full Education and Practice arms were more likely to have a functioning smoke alarm at follow-up ( OR = 2.77 , 95 % CI 1.09 to 7.03 ) and had an average of 0.32 more working alarms per home ( 95 % CI 0.09 to 0.56 ) ."
32,RESULTS,Working alarms per home rose 16 % .
33,RESULTS,Full Education and Practice had similar effectiveness ( p = 0.97 on both outcome measures ) .
34,CONCLUSIONS,"Without exceeding typical fire department installation time , installers can achieve greater smoke alarm operability ."
35,CONCLUSIONS,Hands-on practice is key .
36,CONCLUSIONS,"Two years after installation , for every three homes that received hands-on practice , one had an additional working alarm ."
37,BACKGROUND,http://www.clinicaltrials.gov number NCT00139126 .
38,OBJECTIVE,"To evaluate the performance ( efficacy , safety and acceptability ) of a new micro-adherent absorbent dressing ( UrgoClean ) compared with a hydrofiber dressing ( Aquacel ) in the local management of venous leg ulcers , in the debridement stage ."
39,METHODS,"A non-inferiority European randomised controlled clinical trial ( RCT ) was conducted in 37 centres , on patients presenting with venous or predominantly venous , mixed aetiology leg ulcers at their sloughy stage ( with more than 70 % of the wound bed covered with slough at baseline ) ."
40,METHODS,Patients were followed over a 6-week period and assessed weekly .
41,METHODS,The primary judgement criteria was the relative regression of the wound surface area after the 6-week treatment period .
42,METHODS,Secondary endpoints were the relative reduction of sloughy tissue and the percentage of patients presenting with a debrided wound .
43,RESULTS,"Altogether , 159 patients were randomised to either UrgoClean ( test group ; n = 83 ) or Aquacel ( control group ; n = 76 ) dressings ."
44,RESULTS,"Regarding the wound healing process predictive factors ( wound area , duration , ABPI value , recurrence ) , at baseline , the two groups were well balanced , for both wound and patient characteristics ."
45,RESULTS,"Compression therapy was administered to both groups and after a median 42-day treatment period , the percentage of relative reduction of the wound surface area was very similar ( -36.9 % vs -35.4 % in the UrgoClean and control groups , respectively ) ."
46,RESULTS,"When considering the secondary criteria at week 6 , the relative reduction of sloughy tissue was significantly higher in the UrgoClean group than in the control group ( -65.3 % vs -42,6 % ; p = 0.013 ) ."
47,RESULTS,The percentage of debrided wounds was also significantly higher in the test group ( 52.5 % vs 35.1 % ; p = 0.033 ) .
48,CONCLUSIONS,This ` EARTH ' RCT confirmed that the UrgoClean dressing has similar efficacy and safety compared to Aquacel .
49,CONCLUSIONS,"However , UrgoClean also showed better autolytic properties than the control group in the management of venous leg ulcers at the sloughy stage ."
50,CONCLUSIONS,The new UrgoClean dressing therefore represents a promising therapeutic option within the current range of autolytic dressings available .

55,OBJECTIVE,Eye movements ( EM ) during recall of an aversive memory is a treatment element unique to Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ( EMDR ) .
56,OBJECTIVE,Experimental studies have shown that EM reduce memory vividness and/or emotionality shortly after the intervention .
57,OBJECTIVE,"However , it is unclear whether the immediate effects of the intervention reflect actual changes in memory ."
58,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to test whether immediate reductions in memory vividness and emotionality persist at a 24h follow up and whether the magnitude of these effects is related to the duration of the intervention .
59,METHODS,"Seventy-three undergraduates recalled two negative autobiographical memories , one with EM ( `` recall with EM '' ) and one without ( `` recall only '' ) ."
60,METHODS,"Half of participants recalled each memory for four periods of 24s , the other half for eight periods of 24s ."
61,METHODS,"Memory vividness/emotionality were self-rated at a pre-test , an immediate post-test , and a 24h follow-up test ."
62,RESULTS,"In both duration groups , recall with EM , but not recall only , caused an immediate decrease in memory vividness ."
63,RESULTS,There were no immediate reductions in memory emotionality .
64,RESULTS,"Furthermore , only the ` eight periods ' group showed that recall with EM , but not recall only , caused a decrease in both memory emotionality and memory vividness from the pre-test to the follow-up ."
65,CONCLUSIONS,Only self-report measures were used .
66,CONCLUSIONS,"The findings suggest that recall with EM causes 24-hchanges in memory vividness/emotionality , which may explain part of the EMDR treatment effect , and these effects are related to intervention duration ."
67,OBJECTIVE,Few studies have tested the impact of motivational interviewing ( MI ) delivered by primary care providers on pediatric obesity .
68,OBJECTIVE,This study tested the efficacy of MI delivered by providers and registered dietitians ( RDs ) to parents of overweight children aged 2 through 8 .
69,METHODS,Forty-two practices from the Pediatric Research in Office Settings Network of the American Academy of Pediatrics were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups .
70,METHODS,Group 1 ( usual care ) measured BMI percentile at baseline and 1 - and 2-year follow-up .
71,METHODS,Group 2 ( provider only ) delivered 4 MI counseling sessions to parents of the index child over 2 years .
72,METHODS,Group 3 ( provider + RD ) delivered 4 provider MI sessions plus 6 MI sessions from a RD. .
73,METHODS,The primary outcome was child BMI percentile at 2-year follow up .
74,RESULTS,"At 2-year follow-up , the adjusted BMI percentile was 90.3 , 88.1 , and 87.1 for groups 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively ."
75,RESULTS,The group 3 mean was significantly ( P = .02 ) lower than group 1 .
76,RESULTS,"Mean changes from baseline in BMI percentile were 1.8 , 3.8 , and 4.9 across groups 1 , 2 , and 3 ."
77,CONCLUSIONS,MI delivered by providers and RDs ( group 3 ) resulted in statistically significant reductions in BMI percentile .
78,CONCLUSIONS,Research is needed to determine the clinical significance and persistence of the BMI effects observed .
79,CONCLUSIONS,"How the intervention can be brought to scale ( in particular , how to train physicians to use MI effectively and how best to train RDs and integrate them into primary care settings ) also merits future research ."
80,BACKGROUND,Antithrombin ( AT ) concentrations are reduced after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass compared with the preoperative levels .
81,BACKGROUND,Low postoperative AT is associated with worse short - and mid-term clinical outcomes .
82,BACKGROUND,"The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of AT administration on activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems , platelet function , and the inflammatory response in patients with low postoperative AT levels ."
83,METHODS,Sixty patients with postoperative AT levels of less than 65 % were randomly assigned to receive purified AT ( 5000 IU in three administrations ) or placebo in the postoperative intensive care unit .
84,METHODS,Thirty patients with postoperative AT levels greater than 65 % were observed as controls .
85,METHODS,"Interleukin 6 ( a marker of inflammation ) , prothrombin fragment 1-2 ( a marker of thrombin generation ) , plasmin-antiplasmin complex ( a marker of fibrinolysis ) , and platelet factor 4 ( a marker of platelet activation ) were measured at six different times ."
86,RESULTS,"Compared with the no AT group and control patients , patients receiving AT showed significantly higher AT values until 48 hours after the last administration ."
87,RESULTS,"Analysis of variance for repeated measures showed a significant effect of study treatment in reducing prothrombin fragment 1-2 ( p = 0.009 ; interaction with time sample , p = 0.006 ) and plasmin-antiplasmin complex ( p < 0.001 ; interaction with time sample , p < 0.001 ) values but not interleukin 6 ( p = 0.877 ; interaction with time sample , p = 0.521 ) and platelet factor 4 ( p = 0.913 ; interaction with time sample , p = 0.543 ) ."
88,RESULTS,"No difference in chest tube drainage , reopening for bleeding , and blood transfusion was observed ."
89,CONCLUSIONS,Antithrombin administration in patients with low AT activity after surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass reduces postoperative thrombin generation and fibrinolysis with no effects on platelet activation and inflammatory response .
90,OBJECTIVE,We evaluated patients at tertiary [ both percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) and coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) capable ] and primary hospitals in the EARLY-ACS trial .
91,BACKGROUND,Early invasive management is recommended for high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes .
92,METHODS,"We evaluated outcomes in 9,204 patients presenting to : tertiary sites , primary sites with transfer to tertiary sites ( `` transferred '' ) and those who remained at primary sites ( `` non-transfer '' ) ."
93,RESULTS,"There were 348 tertiary ( n = 7,455 patients ) and 89 primary hospitals [ n = 1,749 patients ( 729 transferred ; 1,020 non-transfer ) ] ."
94,RESULTS,"Significant delays occurred in time from symptom onset to angiography ( 49 hr ) , PCI ( 53h ) , and CABG ( 178 hr ) for transferred patients ( P < 0.001 ) ."
95,RESULTS,"Non-transfer patients had less 30-day death/myocardial infarction [ 9.4 % vs. 11.7 % ( tertiary ) ; adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) : 0.78 ( 0.62-0 .97 ) , P = 0.026 ] ; transferred ( 14.0 % ) and tertiary patients were similar [ adjusted OR : 1.23 ( 0.98-1 .53 ) , P = 0.074 ] ."
96,RESULTS,"Non-transfer patients had lower 1-year mortality [ 4.3 % vs. 6.3 % ( tertiary ) ; adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) : 0.64 ( 0.47-0 .87 ) , P = 0.005 ] : there was no difference between transferred and tertiary patients [ 5.2 % vs. 6.3 % ; adjusted HR : 0.80 ( 0.58-1 .12 ) , P = 0.202 ] ."
97,RESULTS,"Despite similar rates of catheterization , GUSTO severe/moderate bleeding within 120 hr was less in non-transfer [ 3.1 % vs. 6.7 % ( tertiary ) ; adjusted OR : 0.47 ( 0.32-0 .68 ) , P < 0.001 ] , whereas transferred ( 6.1 % ) and tertiary patients were similar [ adjusted OR : 0.94 ( 0.68-1 .30 ) , P = 0.693 ] ."
98,RESULTS,There was no difference in non-CABG bleeding .
99,CONCLUSIONS,Timely angiography and revascularization were often not achieved in transferred patients .
100,CONCLUSIONS,Non-transferred patients presenting to primary sites had the lowest event rates and the best long-term survival .
101,OBJECTIVE,We hypothesized that a targeted temperature of 33 C as compared to that of 36 C would increase survival and reduce the severity of circulatory shock in patients with shock on admission after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) .
102,METHODS,The recently published Target Temperature Management trial ( TTM-trial ) randomized 939 OHCA patients with no difference in outcome between groups and no difference in mortality at the end of the trial in a predefined subgroup of patients with shock at admission .
103,METHODS,Shock was defined as a systolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg for > 30 min or the need of supportive measures to maintain a blood pressure 90 mmHg and/or clinical signs of end-organ hypoperfusion .
104,METHODS,"In this post hoc analysis reported here , we further analyzed the 139 patients with shock at admission ; all had been randomized to receive intervention at 33 C ( TTM33 ; n = 71 ) or 36 C ( TTM36 ; n = 68 ) ."
105,METHODS,Primary outcome was 180-day mortality .
106,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit ( ICU ) and 30-day mortality , severity of circulatory shock assessed by mean arterial pressure , serum lactate , fluid balance and the extended Sequential Organ Failure assessment ( SOFA ) score ."
107,RESULTS,"There was no significance difference between targeted temperature management at 33 C or 36 C on 180-day mortality [ log-rank test , p = 0.17 , hazard ratio 1.33 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.88-1 .98 ] or ICU mortality ( 61 vs. 44 % , p = 0.06 ; relative risk 1.37 , 95 % CI 0.99-1 .91 ) ."
108,RESULTS,Serum lactate and the extended cardiovascular SOFA score were higher in the TTM33 group ( p < 0.01 ) .
109,CONCLUSIONS,We found no benefit in survival or severity of circulatory shock with targeted temperature management at 33 C as compared to 36 C in patients with shock on admission after OHCA .
110,BACKGROUND,"Youths with a family history of alcohol and other drug use disorders ( FH + ) are at a greater risk of developing substance use disorders than their peers with no such family histories ( FH - ) , and this increased risk may be related to impaired maturation of forebrain circuitry ."
111,BACKGROUND,FH + individuals have shown altered forebrain activity at rest and while performing cognitive tasks .
112,BACKGROUND,"However , it is not fully understood how forebrain activity is altered in FH + individuals , and ultimately how these alterations may contribute to substance use disorder risk ."
113,METHODS,"In this study , we tested 72 FH + and 32 FH - youths performing a go/no-go task and examined activations in blocks with only go trials ( Go Only ) , blocks with 50 % go and 50 % no-go trials ( Go/NoGo ) , and a contrast of those 2 blocks ."
114,RESULTS,"FH + youths had significantly greater cerebral activations in both the Go and Go/NoGo blocks than FH - youths in regions including the posterior cingulate/precuneus , bilateral middle/superior temporal gyrus , and medial superior frontal gyrus with no significant group differences in the subtraction between Go Only and Go/NoGo blocks ."
115,RESULTS,"Additionally , FH + youths had moderately slower reaction times on go trials in the Go Only blocks ."
116,CONCLUSIONS,Our findings suggest that global activation increase in FH + youths are modulated by FH density and are not specific to the inhibitory components of the task .
117,CONCLUSIONS,This pattern of increased activations in FH + youths may be at least partially due to impaired forebrain white matter development leading to greater activations/less efficient neural communication during task performance .
118,BACKGROUND,"Risk factors have been proposed for running injuries including ( a ) reduced muscular strength , ( b ) excessive joint movements and ( c ) excessive joint moments in the frontal and transverse planes ."
119,BACKGROUND,"To date , many running injury prevention programs have focused on a `` top down '' approach to strengthen the hip musculature in the attempt to reduce movements and moments at the hip , knee , and/or ankle joints ."
120,BACKGROUND,"However , running mechanics did not change when hip muscle strength increased ."
121,BACKGROUND,It could be speculated that emphasis should be placed on increasing the strength of the ankle joint for a `` ground up '' approach .
122,BACKGROUND,Strengthening of the large and small muscles crossing the ankle joint is assumed to change the force distribution for these muscles and to increase the use of smaller muscles .
123,BACKGROUND,"This would be associated with a reduction of joint and insertion forces , which could have a beneficial effect on injury prevention ."
124,BACKGROUND,"However , training of the ankle joint as an injury prevention strategy has not been studied ."
125,BACKGROUND,Ankle strengthening techniques include isolated strengthening or movement-related strengthening such as functional balance training .
126,BACKGROUND,"There is little knowledge about the efficacy of such training programs on strength alteration , gait or injury reduction ."
127,METHODS,"Novice runners will be randomly assigned to one of three groups : an isolated ankle strengthening group ( strength , n = 40 ) , a functional balance training group ( balance , n = 40 ) or an activity-matched control group ( control , n = 40 ) ."
128,METHODS,Isokinetic strength will be measured using a Biodex System 3 dynamometer .
129,METHODS,Running kinematics and kinetics will be assessed using 3D motion analysis and a force platform .
130,METHODS,Postural control will be assessed by quantifying the magnitude and temporal structure of the center of pressure trace during single leg stance on a force platform .
131,METHODS,"The change pre - and post-training in isokinetic strength , running mechanics , and postural control variables will be compared following the interventions ."
132,METHODS,Injuries rates will be compared between groups over 6months .
133,CONCLUSIONS,Avoiding injury will allow individuals to enjoy the benefits of participating in aerobic activities and reduce the healthcare costs associated with running injuries .

135,BACKGROUND,"Vitamin B12 deficiency causes neurologic and psychiatric disease , especially in older adults ."
136,BACKGROUND,Subacute combined degeneration is characterized by damage to the posterior and lateral spinal cord affecting the corticospinal tract .
137,OBJECTIVE,To test corticospinal tract projections using motor evoked potentials ( MEPs ) by transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) in asymptomatic older adults with low vitamin B12 ( B12 ) levels .
138,METHODS,Cross-sectional study of 53 healthy older adults ( > 70 years ) .
139,METHODS,"MEPs were recorded in the abductor pollicis brevis and tibialis anterior muscles , at rest and during slight tonic contraction ."
140,METHODS,Central motor conduction time ( CMCT ) was derived from the latency of MEPs and peripheral motor conduction time ( PMCT ) .
141,METHODS,Neurophysiological variables were analyzed statistically according to B12 status .
142,RESULTS,Median age was 74.33.6 years ( 58.5 % women ) .
143,RESULTS,Twenty-six out of the 53 subjects had low vitamin B12 levels ( B12 < 221pmol/l ) .
144,RESULTS,MEPs were recorded for all subjects in upper and lower extremities .
145,RESULTS,There were no significant differences in either latency or amplitude of MEPs and CMCT between low and normal B12 groups .
146,RESULTS,There was a significant PMCT delay in the lower extremities in the low B12 group ( p = 0.014 ) .
147,CONCLUSIONS,No subclinical abnormality of the corticospinal tract is detected in asymptomatic B12-deficient older adults .
148,CONCLUSIONS,The peripheral nervous system appears to be more vulnerable to damage attributable to this vitamin deficit .
149,CONCLUSIONS,The neurophysiological evaluation of asymptomatic older adults with lower B12 levels should be focused mainly in peripheral nervous system evaluation .
150,BACKGROUND,Uncontrolled hypertension ( HTN ) is a significant public health problem among blacks in the United States .
151,BACKGROUND,"Despite the proven efficacy of therapeutic lifestyle change ( TLC ) on blood pressure ( BP ) reduction in clinical trials , few studies have examined their effectiveness in church-based settings-an influential institution for health promotion in black communities ."
152,METHODS,"Using a cluster-randomized , 2-arm trial design , this study evaluates the effectiveness of a faith-based TLC intervention vs health education ( HE ) control on BP reduction among hypertensive black adults ."
153,METHODS,The intervention is delivered by trained lay health advisors through group TLC sessions plus motivational interviewing in 32 black churches .
154,METHODS,"Participants in the intervention group receive 11 weekly TLC sessions targeting weight loss , increasing physical activity , fruit , vegetable and low-fat dairy intake , and decreasing fat and sodium intake , plus 3 monthly individual motivational interviewing sessions ."
155,METHODS,Participants in the control group attend 11 weekly classes on HTN and other health topics delivered by health care experts .
156,METHODS,The primary outcome is change in BP from baseline to 6 months .
157,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes include level of physical activity , percent change in weight , and fruit and vegetable consumption at 6 months , and BP control at 9 months ."
158,CONCLUSIONS,"If successful , this trial will provide an alternative and culturally appropriate model for HTN control through evidence-based lifestyle modification delivered in churches by lay health advisors ."
159,BACKGROUND,The classification of clinical severity of Ebstein anomaly still remains a challenge .
160,BACKGROUND,The aim of this study was to focus on the interaction of the pathologically altered right heart with the anatomically-supposedly-normal left heart and to derive from cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) a simple imaging measure for the clinical severity of Ebstein anomaly .
161,RESULTS,Twenty-five patients at a mean age of 2614 years with unrepaired Ebstein anomaly were examined in a prospective study .
162,RESULTS,"Disease severity was classified using CMR volumes and functional measurements in comparison with heart failure markers from clinical data , ECG , laboratory and cardiopulmonary exercise testing , and echocardiography ."
163,RESULTS,All examinations were completed within 24 hours .
164,RESULTS,A total right/left-volume index was defined from end-diastolic volume measurements in CMR : total right/left-volume index = ( RA + aRV + fRV ) / ( LA+LV ) .
165,RESULTS,Mean total right/left-volume index was 2.61.7 ( normal values : 1.10.1 ) .
166,RESULTS,"This new total right/left-volume index correlated with almost all clinically used biomarkers of heart failure : brain natriuretic peptide ( r = 0.691 ; P = 0.0003 ) , QRS ( r = 0.432 ; P = 0.039 ) , peak oxygen consumption/kg ( r = -0.479 ; P = 0.024 ) , ventilatory response to carbon dioxide production at anaerobic threshold ( r = 0.426 ; P = 0.048 ) , the severity of tricuspid regurgitation ( r = 0.692 ; P = 0.009 ) , tricuspid valve offset ( r = 0.583 ; P = 0.004 ) , and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ( r = 0.554 ; P = 0.006 ) ."
167,RESULTS,Previously described severity indices ( [ RA + aRV ] / [ fRV + LA+LV ] ) and fRV/LV end-diastolic volume corresponded only to some parameters .
168,CONCLUSIONS,"In patients with Ebstein anomaly , the easily acquired index of right-sided to left-sided heart volumes from CMR correlated well with established heart failure markers ."
169,CONCLUSIONS,"Our data suggest that the total right/left-volume index should be used as a new and simplified CMR measure , allowing more accurate assessment of disease severity than previously described scoring systems ."
170,OBJECTIVE,This study sought to investigate the association of beta-blocker therapy at discharge with clinical outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
171,BACKGROUND,Limited data are available on the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy for secondary prevention in STEMI patients .
172,METHODS,"Between November 1 , 2005 and September 30 , 2010 , 20,344 patients were enrolled in nationwide , prospective , multicenter registries ."
173,METHODS,"Among these , we studied STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI who were discharged alive ( n = 8,510 ) ."
174,METHODS,"We classified patients into the beta-blocker group ( n = 6,873 ) and no-beta-blocker group ( n = 1,637 ) according to the use of beta-blockers at discharge ."
175,METHODS,"Propensity-score matching analysis was also performed in 1,325 patient triplets ."
176,METHODS,The primary outcome was all-cause death .
177,RESULTS,The median follow-up duration was 367 days ( interquartile range : 157 to 440 days ) .
178,RESULTS,All-cause death occurred in 146 patients ( 2.1 % ) of the beta-blocker group versus 59 patients ( 3.6 % ) of the no-beta-blocker group ( p < 0.001 ) .
179,RESULTS,"After 2:1 propensity-score matching , beta-blocker therapy was associated with a lower incidence of all-cause death ( 2.8 % vs. 4.1 % , adjusted hazard ratio : 0.46 , 95 % confidence interval : 0.27 to 0.78 , p = 0.004 ) ."
180,RESULTS,"The association with better outcome of beta-blocker therapy in terms of all-cause death was consistent across various subgroups , including patients with relatively low-risk profiles such as ejection fraction > 40 % or single-vessel disease ."
181,CONCLUSIONS,Beta-blocker therapy at discharge was associated with improved survival in STEMI patients treated with primary PCI .
182,CONCLUSIONS,"Our results support the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines , which recommend long-term beta-blocker therapy in all patients with STEMI regardless of reperfusion therapy or risk profile ."
183,OBJECTIVE,Local anesthetic wound infiltration is widely used as an effective adjunct during multimodal postoperative pain management .
184,OBJECTIVE,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of continuous wound infusion of ropivacaine in postoperative pain relief , opioid sparing , incidence of nausea and vomiting , and bowel and liver function improvement in patients undergoing open hepatectomy ."
185,METHODS,"Forty patients undergoing open hepatectomy were enrolled in this prospective , randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial ."
186,METHODS,Patients were divided into 2 groups : the 0.9 % saline continuous infusion group ( the control group ; n = 20 ) and the ropivacaine continuous infusion group ( the Ropi group ; n = 20 ) .
187,METHODS,"Outcomes measured postoperatively were pain score at rest and on movement , sufentanil consumption , incidence of nausea and vomiting , and sedation score across 48 postoperative hours ."

215,BACKGROUND,"An increased production of oxidizing species related to reactive oral diseases , such as chronic apical periodontitis , could have systemic implications such as an increase in cardiovascular morbidity ."
216,BACKGROUND,"Based on this consideration , we conducted a prospective study to assess whether subjects affected by chronic periodontitis presented with higher values of oxidative stress than reference values before endodontic treatment , and whether endodontic treatment can reduce the oxidative imbalance and bring it back to normal in these subjects ."
217,METHODS,The authors recruited 2 groups of patients from private studies and dental clinics : these patients were recruited randomly .
218,METHODS,"The oxidative balance in both patients with chronic apical periodontitis ( CAP ) and healthy control patients was determined by measuring the oxidant status , using an identification of the reactive oxygen metabolites ( d-ROMs ) test , while the antioxidant status in these patients was determined using a biological antioxidant potential ( BAP ) test ."
219,METHODS,Both these tests were carried on plasma samples taken from enrolled patients .
220,METHODS,"Values were measured both before the endodontic treatment of the patients with chronic apical periodontitis , and 30 and 90 days after treatment , and compared to those obtained from healthy control patients ."
221,RESULTS,"It was found that , on recruitment , the patients with chronic apical periodontitis exhibited significantly higher levels of oxidative stress than control patients , as determined by the d-ROMs and BAP tests ."
222,RESULTS,"Furthermore , the d-ROMs test values were shown to decrease and the BAP test values to increase over time in patients with chronic apical periodontitis following endodontic therapy ."
223,RESULTS,As the levels of oxidative stress in these patients tended to reduce and return to normal by 90 days following treatment .
224,CONCLUSIONS,This study has demonstrated a positive association between chronic apical periodontitis and oxidative stress .
225,CONCLUSIONS,"Subjects affected by chronic apical periodontitis are exposed to a condition of oxidative stress , which is extremely dangerous to general health ."

334,BACKGROUND,For decades thiopental has been considered as the hypnotic drug of choice for intracranial surgery .
335,BACKGROUND,"However , total intravenous anesthesia performed with thiopental is associated with delayed recovery , whereas early post-operative neurological evaluation is critical ."
336,BACKGROUND,"For this reason , target controlled infusion ( TCI ) of propofol is increasingly used for maintenance of anesthesia ."
337,BACKGROUND,"However , a thiopental TCI has never been assessed for this purpose ."
338,BACKGROUND,We tested the hypothesis that a thiopental TCI provides an acceptable way to achieve early recovery compared to a propofol TCI during supratentorial surgery .
339,METHODS,Eighty patients undergoing elective craniotomy for a supratentorial tumor were randomized to receive either a propofol TCI ( group P ) or a thiopental TCI ( group T ) .
340,METHODS,Both groups received a sufentanil TCI and the bispectral index was monitored .
341,METHODS,The primary end-point was time to tracheal extubation .
342,METHODS,Secondary end-points were per - and post-operative hemodynamics as well as respiratory and recovery parameters .
343,METHODS,Assessment of study end-points was performed by an intensive care specialist blinded ( like the patient ) to the received hypnotic .
344,RESULTS,Time to extubation was significantly ( P < 0.0001 ) shorter in group P ( median 149 minutes ; interquartile range 72-250 minutes ) than in group T ( median 453 minutes ; interquartile range 286-813 minutes ) .
345,RESULTS,"Similarly , the recovery parameters were significantly better in group P than in group T."
346,RESULTS,There was no difference between groups in terms of patient characteristics and hemodynamic parameters .

375,METHODS,32 health care providers and 21 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients .
376,RESULTS,A fundamental enabler was that participants considered the research to be governed and endorsed by the local health service .
377,RESULTS,That the research was perceived to address a health priority for communities was also highly motivating for both providers and patients .
378,RESULTS,Enlisting the support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff champions who were visible to the community as the main source of information about the trial was particularly important .
379,RESULTS,The major implementation barrier for staff was balancing their service delivery roles with adherence to often highly demanding trial-related procedures .
380,RESULTS,This was partially alleviated by the research team 's provision of onsite support and attempts to make trial processes more streamlined .
381,RESULTS,"Although more intensive support was highly desired , there were usually insufficient resources to provide this ."
382,CONCLUSIONS,"Despite strong community and health service support , major investments in time and resources are needed to ensure successful implementation and minimal disruption to already overstretched , routine services ."

397,BACKGROUND,In literature there is a general consensus that the use of the mirror improves proprioception .
398,BACKGROUND,During rehabilitation the mirror is an important instrument to improve stability .
399,BACKGROUND,"In some sports , such as dancing , mirrors are widely used during training ."
400,BACKGROUND,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of a mirror on balance in young dancers .
401,BACKGROUND,Sixty-four young dancers ( ranging from 9-10 years ) were included in this study .
402,BACKGROUND,Thirty-two attending lessons with a mirror ( mirror - group ) were compared to 32 young dancers that attended the same lessons without a mirror ( non-mirror group ) .
403,BACKGROUND,"Balance was evaluated by BESS ( Balance Error Scoring System ) , which consists of three stances ( double limb , single limb , and tandem ) on two surfaces ( firm and foam ) ."
404,BACKGROUND,The errors were assessed at each stance and summed to create the two subtotal scores ( firm and foam surface ) and the final total score ( BESS ) .
405,BACKGROUND,The BESS was performed at recruitment ( T0 ) and after 6months of dance lessons ( T1 ) .
406,RESULTS,The repeated measures ANOVA analysis showed that for the BESS total score there is a difference due to the time ( F = 3.86 ; p < 0.05 ) .
407,RESULTS,No other differences due to the group or to the time of measurement were found ( p > 0.05 ) .
408,RESULTS,The analysis of the multiple regression model showed the influence of the values at T0 for every BESS items and the dominance of limb for stability on an unstable surface standing on one or two legs .
409,CONCLUSIONS,These preliminary results suggest that the use of a mirror in a ballet classroom does not improve balance acquisition of the dancer .
410,CONCLUSIONS,"On the other hand , improvement found after 6months confirms that at the age of the dancers studied motor skills and balance can easily be trained and improved ."

423,BACKGROUND,"Coronary artery bypass grafting using the radial artery has , since the 1990s , gone through a revival ."
424,BACKGROUND,Observational studies have indicated better long-term patency when using radial arteries .
425,BACKGROUND,"Therefore , radial artery might be preferred especially in younger patients where long time patency is important ."
426,BACKGROUND,During the last 10years different endoscopic techniques to harvest the radial artery have evolved .
427,BACKGROUND,"Endoscopic radial artery harvest only requires a small incision near the wrist in contrast to open harvest , which requires an incision from the elbow to the wrist ."
428,BACKGROUND,"However , it is unknown whether the endoscopic technique results in fewer complications or a graft patency comparable to open harvest ."
429,BACKGROUND,"When the radial artery has been harvested , there are two ways to use the radial artery as a graft ."
430,BACKGROUND,One way is sewing it onto the aorta and another is sewing it onto the mammary artery .

631,METHODS,"Minimum followup was 24months ( mean , 30months ; range , 24-39months ) ."
632,METHODS,The distraction rate and the final length gain were similar in the treated and control limbs .
633,METHODS,A priori power analysis suggested that 34 legs were required to achieve statistical significance of 0.05 with 80 % of power to detect a 50 % difference in treatment effect between treatment and control groups .
634,RESULTS,"There were no differences in calf pain , knee and ankle ROM , and maximal calf circumferences between the two legs at each time point ."
635,CONCLUSIONS,Local injection of 200IU BtX-A at the human calf muscle does not appear to reduce calf pain or help enhance ROM of the knee and ankle during tibial lengthening .

748,RESULTS,"The primary outcome of baseline-adjusted ISSI-2 at 48 weeks was higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group ( 339.8 27.8 vs. 229.3 28.4 , P = 0.008 ) ."
749,RESULTS,"Baseline-adjusted HbA1c at 48 weeks was lower in the liraglutide group ( 6.2 0.1 % vs. 6.6 0.1 % , P = 0.055 ) ( 44 1.1 vs. 49 1.1 mmol/mol ) ."
750,RESULTS,"At each quarterly assessment , > 50 % of participants on liraglutide had an HbA1c 6.0 % ( 42 mmol/mol ) and glucose tolerance in the nondiabetic range ."
751,RESULTS,"Despite this level of glycemic control , no difference was found in the incidence of hypoglycemia between the liraglutide and placebo groups ( P = 0.61 ) ."
752,RESULTS,"Two weeks after stopping treatment , however , the beneficial effect on ISSI-2 of liraglutide versus placebo was entirely lost ( 191.9 24.7 vs. 238.1 25.2 , P = 0.20 ) ."
753,CONCLUSIONS,Liraglutide provides robust enhancement of - cell function that is sustained over 48 weeks in early T2DM but lost upon cessation of therapy .
754,OBJECTIVE,To investigate the effectiveness of rectally administered indomethacin in the prophylaxis of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) pancreatitis and hyperamylasaemia in a multicentre study .
755,METHODS,"A prospective , randomised , placebo-controlled multicentre study in five endoscopic units was conducted on 686 patients randomised to receive a suppository containing 100 mg indomethacin , or an inert placebo , 10-15 min before ERCP ."
756,METHODS,"Post-ERCP pancreatitis and hyperamylasaemia were evaluated 24 h following the procedure on the basis of clinical signs and laboratory parameters , and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging findings if required ."
757,RESULTS,Twenty-one patients were excluded because of incompleteness of their data or because of protocol violation .
758,RESULTS,The results of 665 investigations were evaluated : 347 in the indomethacin group and 318 in the placebo group .
759,RESULTS,The distributions of the risk factors in the two groups did not differ significantly .
760,RESULTS,Pancreatitis developed in 42 patients ( 6.3 % ) : it was mild in 34 ( 5.1 % ) and severe in eight ( 1.2 % ) cases .
761,RESULTS,Hyperamylaesemia occurred in 160 patients ( 24.1 % ) .
762,RESULTS,There was no significant difference between the indomethacin and placebo groups in the incidence of either post-ERCP pancreatitis ( 5.8 % vs 6.9 % ) or hyperamylasaemia ( 23.3 % vs 24.8 % ) .
763,RESULTS,"Similarly , subgroup analysis did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups ."
764,CONCLUSIONS,100 mg rectal indomethacin administered before ERCP did not prove effective in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis .
765,BACKGROUND,We sought to determine the incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes in treated elderly hypertensive patients and the prognostic impact of diabetes on long-term survival .
766,METHODS,"The Second Australian National Blood Pressure ( ANBP2 ) study randomized 6,083 hypertensive patients aged 65-84 years to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) or thiazide diuretic-based therapy and followed them for a median of 4.1 years ."
767,METHODS,"Long-term survival was determined in 5,678 patients over an additional median of 6.9 years after ANBP2 ( post-trial ) ."
768,RESULTS,"After ANBP2 , the cohort was classified into preexisting ( 7.2 % ) , newly diagnosed ( 5.6 % ) , and no diabetes ( 87.2 % ) groups ."
769,RESULTS,A 44 % higher incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes was observed in patients randomized to thiazide diuretic compared with ACEI-based treatment .

933,RESULTS,"Patients with a proteomic test classification of poor had worse survival on erlotinib than on chemotherapy ( hazard ratio 172 [ 95 % CI 108-274 ] , p = 0022 ) ."
934,RESULTS,"There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatments for patients with a proteomic test classification of good ( adjusted HR 106 [ 077-146 ] , p = 0714 ) ."
935,RESULTS,"In the group of patients who received chemotherapy , the most common grade 3 or 4 toxic effect was neutropenia ( 19 [ 15 % ] vs one [ < 1 % ] in the erlotinib group ) , whereas skin toxicity ( one [ < 1 % ] vs 22 [ 16 % ] ) was the most frequent in the erlotinib group ."
936,CONCLUSIONS,Our findings indicate that serum protein test status is predictive of differential benefit in overall survival for erlotinib versus chemotherapy in the second-line setting .
937,CONCLUSIONS,Patients classified as likely to have a poor outcome have better outcomes on chemotherapy than on erlotinib .

1108,BACKGROUND,Current knowledge on how to prevent IPV is limited-especially within war-affected settings .
1109,BACKGROUND,"To inform prevention programming on gender-based violence in settings affected by conflict , we evaluated the impact of adding a targeted men 's intervention to a community-based prevention programme in Cte d'Ivoire ."
1110,METHODS,"We conducted a two-armed , non-blinded cluster randomized trial in Cte d'Ivoire among 12 pair-matched communities spanning government-controlled , UN buffer , and rebel-controlled zones ."
1111,METHODS,The intervention communities received a 16-week IPV prevention intervention using a men 's discussion group format .
1112,METHODS,All communities received community-based prevention programmes .
1113,METHODS,Baseline data were collected from couples in September 2010 ( pre-intervention ) and follow-up in March 2012 ( one year post-intervention ) .
1114,METHODS,The primary trial outcome was women 's reported experiences of physical and/or sexual IPV in the last 12 months .
1115,METHODS,"We also assessed men 's reported intention to use physical IPV , attitudes towards sexual IPV , use of hostility and conflict management skills , and participation in gendered household tasks ."
1116,METHODS,An adjusted cluster-level intention to treat analysis was used to compare outcomes between intervention and control communities at follow-up .
1117,RESULTS,"At follow-up , reported levels of physical and/or sexual IPV in the intervention arm had decreased compared to the control arm ( ARR 0.52 , 95 % CI 0.18-1 .51 , not significant ) ."
1118,RESULTS,"Men participating in the intervention reported decreased intentions to use physical IPV ( ARR 0.83 , 95 % CI 0.66-1 .06 ) and improved attitudes toward sexual IPV ( ARR 1.21 , 95 % CI 0.77-1 .91 ) ."
1119,RESULTS,"Significant differences were found between men in the intervention and control arms ' reported ability to control their hostility and manage conflict ( ARR 1.3 , 95 % CI 1.06-1 .58 ) , and participation in gendered household tasks ( ARR 2.47 , 95 % CI 1.24-4 .90 ) ."
1120,CONCLUSIONS,This trial points to the value of adding interventions working with men alongside community activities to reduce levels of IPV in conflict-affected settings .
1121,CONCLUSIONS,The intervention significantly influenced men 's reported behaviours related to hostility and conflict management and gender equitable behaviours .
1122,CONCLUSIONS,"The decreased mean level of IPV and the differences between intervention and control arms , while not statistically significant , suggest that IPV in conflict-affected areas can be reduced through concerted efforts to include men directly in violence prevention programming ."
1123,CONCLUSIONS,A larger-scale trial is needed to replicate these findings and further understand the mechanisms of change .

1210,METHODS,Blood pressure and RPP were measured before and after each session .
1211,RESULTS,"Low-intensity and high-intensity WBV induced significantly higher Vo2 by an average of 0.69 and 0.79 mL/kg/min , respectively , compared with the control condition ."
1212,RESULTS,These protocols also increased HR by an average of 4 bpm .
1213,RESULTS,The 2 WBV protocols induced higher RPE than the control condition during static standing exercise only .
1214,RESULTS,"Although the diastolic and systolic BP and RPP were increased at the end of each exercise session , the addition of WBV had no significant effect on these variables ."
1215,CONCLUSIONS,The results are generalizable only to ambulatory and community-dwelling people with chronic stroke .

1240,BACKGROUND,"Emotional eating in children has been related to the consumption of energy-dense foods and obesity , but the development of emotional eating in young children is poorly understood ."
1241,OBJECTIVE,We evaluated whether emotional eating can be induced in 5-7-y-old children in the laboratory and assessed whether parental use of overly controlling feeding practices at 3-5 y of age predicts a greater subsequent tendency for children to eat under conditions of mild stress at ages 5-7 y.
1242,METHODS,"Forty-one parent-child dyads were recruited to participate in this longitudinal study , which involved parents and children being observed consuming a standard lunch , completing questionnaire measures of parental feeding practices , participating in a research procedure to induce child emotion ( or a control procedure ) , and observing children 's consumption of snack foods ."
1243,RESULTS,Children at ages 5-7 y who were exposed to a mild emotional stressor consumed significantly more calories from snack foods in the absence of hunger than did children in a control group .
1244,RESULTS,Parents who reported the use of more food as a reward and restriction of food for health reasons with their children at ages 3-5 y were more likely to have children who ate more under conditions of negative emotion at ages 5-7 y.
1245,CONCLUSIONS,Parents who overly control children 's food intake may unintentionally teach children to rely on palatable foods to cope with negative emotions .
1246,CONCLUSIONS,Additional research is needed to evaluate the implications of these findings for children 's food intake and weight outside of the laboratory setting .
1247,CONCLUSIONS,This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01122290 .

1536,OBJECTIVE,This study compared the therapeutic effects of collateral meridian therapy ( CMT ) with traditional acupoint pressure therapy ( APT ) in patients with unilateral upper back pain .
1537,METHODS,"Forty-nine patients with active myofascial trigger points in upper trapezius muscle were randomly allocated to the control ( CTL ) , APT , or CMT group ."
1538,METHODS,Each subject in the CMT and APT groups received 2 sessions of treatment per week over 1 month .
1539,RESULTS,"Patients in the APT and CMT groups showed significant improvements 1 month after treatment in visual analogue scale , range of motion , pain pressure threshold , regional superficial blood flow , and physical health , as compared to the CTL group ."
1540,RESULTS,No significant differences in outcome measures were found between APT and CMT groups 1 month after treatment .
1541,CONCLUSIONS,Both APT and CMT have comparable therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of unilateral upper back pain with active myofascial trigger points in the upper trapezius muscle .
1542,BACKGROUND,"It remains unknown whether local anaesthetic dose is the only factor influencing continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve block effects , or whether concentration , volume , or both exert an influence as well ."
1543,METHODS,Bilateral sciatic catheters were inserted in volunteers ( n = 24 ) .
1544,METHODS,Catheters were randomly assigned to ropivacaine of either 0.1 % ( 8 ml h ( -1 ) ) or 0.4 % ( 2 ml h ( -1 ) ) for 6 h.
1545,METHODS,The primary endpoint was the tolerance to transcutaneous electrical stimulation within the tibial nerve distribution at hour 6 .
1546,METHODS,Secondary endpoints included current tolerance at other time points and plantar flexion maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( 22 h total ) .
1547,RESULTS,"At hour 6 , tolerance to cutaneous stimulation for limbs receiving 0.1 % ropivacaine was [ mean ( standard deviation ) ] 27.0 ( 20.2 ) vs26 .9 ( 20.4 ) mA for limbs receiving 0.4 % [ estimated mean difference 0.2 mA ; 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) -8.2 to 8.5 ; P = 0.02 and 0.03 for lower and upper boundaries , respectively ] ."
1548,RESULTS,"Because the 90 % CI fell within the prespecified tolerance 10 mA , we conclude that the effect of the two concentration/volume combinations were equivalent ."
1549,RESULTS,Similar negative findings were found for the secondary outcomes .
1550,CONCLUSIONS,"For continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks , we found no evidence that local anaesthetic concentration and volume influence block characteristics , suggesting that local anaesthetic dose ( mass ) is the primary determinant of perineural infusion effects in this anatomic location ."
1551,CONCLUSIONS,These findings suggest that for ambulatory perineural local anaesthetic infusion-for which there is usually a finite local anaesthetic reservoir-decreasing the basal rate while increasing the local anaesthetic concentration may allow for increased infusion duration without compromising postoperative analgesia .

1553,BACKGROUND,"In VOICE , a multisite HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) trial , plasma drug levels pointed to widespread product nonuse , despite high adherence estimated by self-reports and clinic product counts ."
1554,BACKGROUND,"Using a socio-ecological framework ( SEF ) , we explored socio-cultural and contextual factors that influenced participants ' experience of daily vaginal gel and oral tablet regimens in VOICE ."
1555,METHODS,"In Johannesburg , a qualitative ancillary study was concurrently conducted among randomly selected VOICE participants assigned to in-depth interviews ( n = 41 ) , serial ethnographic interviews ( n = 21 ) , or focus group discussions ( n = 40 ) ."
1556,METHODS,"Audiotaped interviews were transcribed , translated , and coded thematically for analysis ."
1557,RESULTS,"Of the 102 participants , the mean age was 27 years , and 96 % had a primary sex partner with whom 43 % cohabitated ."
1558,RESULTS,"Few women reported lasting nonuse , which they typically attributed to missed visits , lack of product replenishments , and family-related travel or work ."
1559,RESULTS,"Women acknowledged occasionally skipping or mistiming doses because they forgot , were busy , felt lazy or bored , feared or experienced side effects ."
1560,RESULTS,"However , nearly all knew or heard of other study participants who did not use products daily ."
1561,RESULTS,"Three overarching themes emerged from further analyses : ambivalence toward research , preserving a healthy status , and managing social relationships ."
1562,RESULTS,These themes highlighted the profound and complex meanings associated with participating in a blinded HIV PrEP trial and taking antiretroviral-based products .
1563,RESULTS,"The unknown efficacy of products , their connection with HIV infection , challenges with daily regimen given social risks , lack of support-from partners and significant others-and the relationship tradeoffs entailed by using the products appear to discourage adequate product use ."
1564,CONCLUSIONS,Personal acknowledgment of product nonuse was challenging .
1565,CONCLUSIONS,This qualitative inquiry highlighted key influences at all SEF levels that shaped women 's perceptions of trial participation and experiences with investigational products .
1566,CONCLUSIONS,Whether these impacted women 's behaviors and may have contributed to ineffective trial results warrants further investigation .
1567,OBJECTIVE,"To improve the quality of eradication therapy ( ET ) , by increasing patient compliance ."
1568,METHODS,An open-label cohort multicenter randomized study was conducted .
1569,METHODS,A total of 350 patients with Helicobacter pylori infection-associated diseases and indications for ET were examined .

1571,RESULTS,"In the study group of patients motivated for treatment , the efficiency of ET was significantly higher than in the control group ."
1572,RESULTS,The factors influencing treatment adherence were identified and methods to optimize compliance during H. pylori eradication were developed .
1573,CONCLUSIONS,Awareness of the essence of the disease in a patient and his higher motivation for compliance are one of the components of successful H. pylori eradication .
1574,OBJECTIVE,Motor learning results in changes of movement representation in primary motor cortex ( M1 ) a process involving long-term potentiation ( LTP ) .
1575,OBJECTIVE,Pairing motor training with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) of M1 enhances the formation of a motor memory .
1576,OBJECTIVE,Here we determined the effect of pairing M1 stimulation and the execution of training movements at different times and frequencies on the formation of a motor memory .
1577,METHODS,"Formation of a motor memory was defined as increases in motor evoked potentials ( MEP ) of the training agonist ( extensor carpi ulnaris muscle , ECU ) and increases in peak acceleration of the trained movements that last more than 60min ."
1578,METHODS,"Training consisted of auditory-paced ballistic wrist extension movements ( 30min , 0.5 Hz ) paired with 0.1 , 0.25 or 0.5 Hz subthreshold rTMS ."
1579,METHODS,"The rTMS pulse was applied at either the onset , 100ms prior to or 300ms after the onset of training movement related increases in electromyographic ( EMG ) activity of ECU ."
1580,METHODS,This was compared to a Sham condition .
1581,RESULTS,Only 0.1 Hz rTMS applied at the onset of the training related increase in ECU-EMG activity resulted in increases in MEP amplitudes and peak acceleration when compared to the Sham .
1582,CONCLUSIONS,The formation of motor memory is enhanced above the nave level by co-administration of low frequency rTMS at the time of execution of training movements .
1583,CONCLUSIONS,These results indicate the importance of time and frequency of rTMS in these settings and should be considered in the design of rehabilitation treatment strategies using rTMS .

1597,BACKGROUND,The effect of oral polio vaccine administered already at birth ( OPV0 ) on child survival was not examined before being recommended in 1985 .
1598,BACKGROUND,"Observational data suggested that OPV0 was harmful for boys , and trials have shown that neonatal vitamin A supplementation ( NVAS ) at birth may be beneficial for boys ."
1599,BACKGROUND,We set out to test this research question in a randomised trial .
1600,METHODS,"The trial was carried out at the Bandim Health Project , Guinea-Bissau ."
1601,METHODS,We planned to enrol 900 low-birth weight ( LBW ) boys in a randomised trial to investigate whether NVAS instead of OPV0 could lower infant mortality for LBW boys .
1602,METHODS,"At birth , the children were randomised to OPV ( usual treatment ) or VAS ( intervention treatment ) and followed for 6 months for growth and 12 months for survival ."
1603,METHODS,Hazard Ratios ( HR ) for mortality were calculated using Cox regression .
1604,METHODS,We compared the individual anthropometry measurements to the 2006 WHO growth reference .
1605,METHODS,We compared differences in z-scores by linear regression .
1606,METHODS,Relative risks ( RR ) of being stunted or underweight were calculated in Poisson regression models with robust standard errors .
1607,RESULTS,In the rainy season we detected a cluster of deaths in the VAS group and the trial was halted immediately with 232 boys enrolled .
1608,RESULTS,The VAS group had significantly higher mortality than the OPV0 group in the rainy season ( HR : 9.91 ( 1.23 - 80 ) ) .
1609,RESULTS,"All deaths had had contact with the neonatal nursery ; of seven VAS boys enrolled during one week in September , six died within two months of age , whereas only one died among the six boys receiving OPV ( p = 0.05 ) ."
1610,RESULTS,Growth ( weight and arm-circumference ) in the VAS group was significantly worse until age 3 months .
1611,CONCLUSIONS,VAS at birth instead of OPV was not beneficial for the LBW boys in this study .
1612,CONCLUSIONS,With the premature closure of the trial it was not possible to answer the research question .
1613,CONCLUSIONS,"However , the results of this study call for extra caution when testing the effect of NVAS in the future ."

1616,BACKGROUND,Dual orexin receptor antagonists ( DORAs ) enable initiation and maintenance of sleep in patients with primary insomnia .
1617,BACKGROUND,"Blockade of the orexin system has shown reduction of drug-seeking behavior in animal studies , supporting the role of orexin antagonism as a novel approach for treating substance abuse ."
1618,BACKGROUND,"Since hypnotics are traditionally associated with misuse , a lack of abuse liability of DORAs would offer significant benefits over current therapies for sleep disorders ."
1619,METHODS,"In this randomized , crossover , proof-of-concept study , single oral doses of the DORA almorexant ( 200 , 400 , and 1,000 mg ) were administered to healthy subjects with previous non-therapeutic experience with central nervous system depressants and were compared with placebo and single oral doses of zolpidem ( 20 and 40 mg ) , a benzodiazepine-like drug ."
1620,METHODS,"Subjective measures of abuse potential ( visual analog scales [ VAS ] , Addiction Research Center Inventory , and Subjective Drug Value ) and objective measures ( divided attention [ DA ] ) were evaluated over 24 h post-dose in 33 evaluable subjects ."
1621,RESULTS,Drug Liking VAS peak effect ( E max ; primary endpoint ) was significantly higher for all doses of almorexant and zolpidem compared with placebo ( p < 0.001 ) .
1622,RESULTS,"Almorexant 200 mg showed significantly less ` Drug Liking ' than both zolpidem doses ( p < 0.01 ) , and almorexant 400 mg had smaller effects than zolpidem 20 mg ( p < 0.05 ) , while almorexant 1,000 mg was not different from either zolpidem dose ."
1623,RESULTS,"Results were similar for other subjective measures , although almorexant generally showed smaller negative and perceptual effects compared with zolpidem ."
1624,RESULTS,Almorexant also showed less cognitive impairment compared with zolpidem on most DA endpoints .
1625,CONCLUSIONS,"This study in humans investigating single doses of almorexant is the first to explore and show abuse liability of a DORA , a class of compounds that is not only promising for the treatment of sleep disorders , but also of addiction ."
1626,OBJECTIVE,Music therapy is an innovative approach to support people with severe mental illness ( SMI ) .

1837,CONCLUSIONS,"The alvimopan cohort experienced quicker GI-2 recovery ( 5.5 vs 6.8 d ; hazard ratio : 1.8 ; p < 0.0001 ) , shorter mean LOS ( 7.4 vs 10.1 d ; p = 0.0051 ) , and fewer episodes of POI-related morbidity ( 8.4 % vs 29.1 % ; p < 0.001 ) ."
1838,CONCLUSIONS,"The incidence of opioid consumption and AEs or serious AEs ( SAEs ) was comparable except for POI , which was lower in the alvimopan group ( AEs : 7 % vs 26 % ; SAEs : 5 % vs 20 % , respectively ) ."
1839,CONCLUSIONS,Cardiovascular AEs occurred in 8.4 % ( alvimopan ) and 15.3 % ( placebo ) of patients ( p = 0.09 ) .
1840,CONCLUSIONS,Generalizability may be limited due to the exclusion of epidural analgesia and the inclusion of mostly high-volume centers utilizing open laparotomy .
1841,CONCLUSIONS,"Alvimopan is a useful addition to a standardized care pathway in patients undergoing RC by accelerating GI recovery and shortening LOS , with a safety profile similar to placebo ."
1842,RESULTS,This study examined the effects of alvimopan on bowel recovery in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer .
1843,RESULTS,"Patients receiving alvimopan experienced quicker bowel recovery and had a shorter hospital stay compared with those who received placebo , with comparable safety ."

1845,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the effect of 1 ) patient values as expressed by family members and 2 ) a requirement to document patients ' functional prognosis on intensivists ' intention to discuss withdrawal of life support in a hypothetical family meeting .
1846,METHODS,"A three-armed , randomized trial ."
1847,METHODS,One hundred seventy-nine U.S. hospitals with training programs in critical care accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education .
1848,METHODS,"Six hundred thirty intensivists recruited via e-mail invitation from a database of 1,850 eligible academic intensivists ."
1849,METHODS,"Each intensivist was randomized to review 10 , online , clinical scenarios with a range of illness severities involving a hypothetical patient ( Mrs. X ) ."
1850,METHODS,"In control-group scenarios , the patient did not want continued life support without a reasonable chance of independent living ."
1851,METHODS,"In the first experimental arm , the patient wanted life support regardless of functional outcome ."
1852,METHODS,"In the second experimental arm , patient values were identical to the control group , but intensivists were required to record the patient 's estimated 3-month functional prognosis ."
1853,RESULTS,Response to the question : `` Would you bring up the possibility of withdrawing life support with Mrs. X 's family ? ''
1854,RESULTS,answered using a five-point Likert scale .
1855,RESULTS,"There was no effect of patient values on whether intensivists intended to discuss withdrawal of life support ( p = 0.81 ) , but intensivists randomized to record functional prognosis were 49 % more likely ( 95 % CI , 20-85 % ) to discuss withdrawal ."
1856,CONCLUSIONS,"In this national , scenario-based , randomized trial , patient values had no effect on intensivists ' decisions to discuss withdrawal of life support with family ."
1857,CONCLUSIONS,"However , requiring intensivists to record patients ' estimated 3-month functional outcome substantially increased their intention to discuss withdrawal ."
1858,OBJECTIVE,To determine women 's satisfaction with pain relief using patient controlled analgesia with remifentanil compared with epidural analgesia during labour .
1859,METHODS,Multicentre randomised controlled equivalence trial .
1860,METHODS,15 hospitals in the Netherlands .
1861,METHODS,Women with an intermediate to high obstetric risk with an intention to deliver vaginally .
1862,METHODS,"To exclude a clinically relevant difference in satisfaction with pain relief of more than 10 % , we needed to include 1136 women ."
1863,METHODS,Because of missing values for satisfaction this number was increased to 1400 before any analysis .
1864,METHODS,We used multiple imputation to correct for missing data .
1865,METHODS,Before the onset of active labour consenting women were randomised to a pain relief strategy with patient controlled remifentanil or epidural analgesia if they requested pain relief during labour .
1866,METHODS,"Primary outcome was satisfaction with pain relief , measured hourly on a visual analogue scale and expressed as area under the curve ( AUC ) , thus providing a time weighted measure of total satisfaction with pain relief ."
1867,METHODS,A higher AUC represents higher satisfaction with pain relief .
1868,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes were pain intensity scores , mode of delivery , and maternal and neonatal outcomes ."
1869,METHODS,Analysis was done by intention to treat .
1870,METHODS,The study was defined as an equivalence study for the primary outcome .
1871,RESULTS,"1414 women were randomised , of whom 709 were allocated to patient controlled remifentanil and 705 to epidural analgesia ."
1872,RESULTS,Baseline characteristics were comparable .
1873,RESULTS,"Pain relief was ultimately used in 65 % ( 447/687 ) in the remifentanil group and 52 % ( 347/671 ) in the epidural analgesia group ( relative risk 1.32 , 95 % confidence interval 1.18 to 1.48 ) ."
1874,RESULTS,"Cross over occurred in 7 % ( 45/687 ) and 8 % ( 51/671 ) of women , respectively ."
1875,RESULTS,"Of women primarily treated with remifentanil , 13 % ( 53/402 ) converted to epidural analgesia , while in women primarily treated with epidural analgesia 1 % ( 3/296 ) converted to remifentanil ."
1876,RESULTS,"The area under the curve for total satisfaction with pain relief was 30.9 in the remifentanil group versus 33.7 in the epidural analgesia group ( mean difference -2.8 , 95 % confidence interval -6.9 to 1.3 ) ."
1877,RESULTS,"For who actually received pain relief the area under the curve for satisfaction with pain relief after the start of pain relief was 25.6 in the remifentanil group versus 36.1 in the epidural analgesia group ( mean difference -10.4 , -13.9 to -7.0 ) ."
1878,RESULTS,The rate of caesarean section was 15 % in both groups .
1879,RESULTS,"Oxygen saturation was significantly lower ( SpO2 < 92 % ) in women who used remifentanil ( relative risk 1.5 , 1.4 to 1.7 ) ."
1880,RESULTS,Maternal and neonatal outcomes were comparable between both groups .
1881,CONCLUSIONS,"In women in labour , patient controlled analgesia with remifentanil is not equivalent to epidural analgesia with respect to scores on satisfaction with pain relief ."
1882,CONCLUSIONS,Satisfaction with pain relief was significantly higher in women who were allocated to and received epidural analgesia .

1889,METHODS,"Pre-specified primary analysis , using an ITT population , was on the ADAS-cog11 ."
1890,METHODS,"Secondary analyses included as a key secondary variable the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes ( CDR-SB ) , and another secondary variable of the ADCS-ADL ."
1891,RESULTS,"On-treatment analysis demonstrated numerical differences favoring 5 mg/day over placebo , with nominal significance at Month 18 ( delta = 2.7 , p = 0.03 ) ."
1892,RESULTS,"Patients with mild AD , whether defined by MMSE or ADAS-cog , demonstrated significant differences favoring 5 mg/day on ADAS-cog and trends on CDR-sb and ADCS-ADL at Month 18 ."
1893,RESULTS,TTP488 plasma concentrations of 7.6-16 .8 ng/mL were associated with a decreased decline in ADAS-cog over time compared to placebo .
1894,RESULTS,Worsening on the ADAS-cog relative to placebo was evident at 46.8-167 .0 ng/mL .
1895,CONCLUSIONS,Results of these analyses support further investigation of 5 mg/day in future Phase 3 trials in patients with mild AD .

1900,METHODS,Post hoc subgroup analyses of weight change ( categories ) and blood pressure were performed overall and by treatment group ( 6-week sibutramine followed by randomized placebo or continued sibutramine ) .
1901,METHODS,"The primary outcome event ( POE ) was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , resuscitated cardiac arrest or cardiovascular death ."
1902,METHODS,"Time-to-event analyses of the POE were performed using Cox regression models with factors for treatment , subgroups and interactions ."
1903,RESULTS,"During the initial 6-week sibutramine treatment period , systolic blood pressure decreased progressively with increasing weight loss in hypertensive subjects ( -8.110.5 mmHg with < 5kg weight loss to -10.811.0 mmHg with 5kg weight loss ) ."
1904,RESULTS,The highest POE incidence occurred mainly in groups with increases in both weight and blood pressure .
1905,RESULTS,"However , with long-term sibutramine treatment , a markedly lower blood pressure tended to increase POEs ."
1906,CONCLUSIONS,"Modest weight loss and modest lower blood pressure each reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events , as expected ."
1907,CONCLUSIONS,"However , the combination of early marked weight loss and rapid blood pressure reduction seems to be harmful in this obese elderly cardiovascular diseased population ."

1972,CONCLUSIONS,Approximately half of the administered LZD dose was removed during the HD session in these selected cohorts of ESRD patients .
1973,CONCLUSIONS,LZD was generally well tolerated .
1974,CONCLUSIONS,The dose of LZD did not need to be adjusted for patients with acute renal dysfunction or ESRD on HD .
1975,CONCLUSIONS,One of the twice-daily doses should be administered after the dialysis session because almost half of the LZD dose was substantially removed by HD .
1976,CONCLUSIONS,"During the first three dialysis sessions of the treatment course , to avoid potentially ineffective therapy , a supplemental dose of LZD might be given if necessary or the dose of LZD should be administered 4h before the beginning of the HD session ."

2052,BACKGROUND,Heavy drinking is common among students at UK universities .
2053,BACKGROUND,US students overestimate how much their peers drink and correcting this through the use of social norm messages may promote responsible drinking .
2054,OBJECTIVE,We tested whether there is an association between perceived campus drinking norms and usual drinking behavior in UK university students and whether norm messages about responsible drinking correct normative misperceptions and increase students ' intentions to drink responsibly .
2055,METHODS,"1,020 UK university students took part in an online study ."
2056,METHODS,"Participants were exposed to one of five message types : a descriptive norm , an injunctive norm , a descriptive and injunctive norm , or one of two control messages ."
2057,METHODS,Message credibility was assessed .
2058,METHODS,Afterwards participants completed measures of intentions to drink responsibly and we measured usual drinking habits and perceptions of peer drinking .
2059,RESULTS,"Perceptions of peer drinking were associated modestly with usual drinking behavior , whereby participants who believed other students drank responsibly also drank responsibly ."
2060,RESULTS,"Norm messages changed normative perceptions , but not in the target population of participants who underestimated responsible drinking in their peers at baseline ."
2061,RESULTS,"Norm messages did not increase intentions to drink responsibly and although based on accurate data , norm messages were not seen as credible ."
2062,CONCLUSIONS,"In this UK based study , although perceived social norms about peer drinking were associated with individual differences in drinking habits , campus wide norm messages about responsible drinking did not affect students ' intentions to drink more responsibly ."
2063,CONCLUSIONS,More research is required to determine if this approach can be applied to UK settings .
2064,BACKGROUND,"Oxaliplatin is an integral component of colorectal cancer treatment , but its use is limited by neurotoxicity ."
2065,BACKGROUND,"The Combined Oxaliplatin Neurotoxicity Prevention Trial ( CONcePT ) tested intermittent oxaliplatin ( IO ) administration and the use of concurrent calcium and magnesium salts ( Ca/Mg ) , two modifications intended to reduce neurotoxicity and extend the duration of treatment ."
2066,METHODS,"In this trial involving double randomization , 140 patients were randomized to receive modified FOLFOX7 plus bevacizumab with IO ( eight-cycle blocks of oxaliplatin treatment ) versus continuous oxaliplatin ( CO ) ; and Ca/Mg versus placebo ( pre - and postoxaliplatin infusion ) ."
2067,METHODS,The primary end point was time-to-treatment failure ( TTF ) .
2068,RESULTS,One hundred thirty-nine patients were entered and treated up to the point of early study termination due to concerns by the data-monitoring committee ( DMC ) that Ca/Mg adversely affected tumor response .
2069,RESULTS,Tumor response was not a study end point .
2070,RESULTS,"Given DMC concerns , an additional independent , blinded radiology review of all images showed no adverse effect of treatment schedule or Ca/Mg on response by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ."
2071,RESULTS,"The IO schedule was superior to CO [ hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.581 , P = 0.0026 ] for both TTF and time-to-tumor progression ( TTP ) ( HR = 0.533 , P = 0.047 ) ."
2072,CONCLUSIONS,An IO dosing schedule had a significant benefit on both TTF and TTP versus CO dosing in this trial despite the very attenuated sample .
2073,CONCLUSIONS,There was no effect of Ca/Mg on response .

2181,CONCLUSIONS,"A single s.c. dose of 150 g corifollitropin alfa on the first day of ovarian stimulation , followed if necessary , from Day 8 onwards , with 450 IU of follitropin beta/day , is not inferior to daily doses of 450 IU follitropin beta ."
2182,CONCLUSIONS,The 95 % CI of the difference between medians in the number of oocytes retrieved was -1 to +1 within the safety margin of 1.5 .
2183,BACKGROUND,Recent data from retrospective studies suggest that the use of corifollitropin alfa in poor responders is promising since it could simplify ovarian stimulation without compromising its outcome .
2184,METHODS,"Seventy-nine women with previous poor ovarian response undergoing ICSI treatment were enrolled in this open label , non-inferiority , randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) ."
2185,METHODS,"Inclusion criteria were : previous poor response to ovarian stimulation ( 4 COCs ) after maximal stimulation , age < 45 years , regular spontaneous menstrual cycle , body mass index : 18-32 kg/m ( 2 ) and basal follicle stimulating hormone 20 IU/l ."
2186,METHODS,"On Day 2 of the menstrual cycle , patients were administered either a single s.c dose of 150 g corifollitropin alfa ( n = 40 ) or a fixed daily dose of 450 IU of follitropin beta ( n = 39 ) ."
2187,METHODS,"In the corifollitropin alfa group , 450 IU of follitropin beta were administered from Day 8 of stimulation until the day of human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) administration , if necessary ."
2188,METHODS,"To inhibit premature luteinizing hormone surge , the gonadotrophin releasing hormone antagonist ganirelix was used ."
2189,METHODS,"Triggering of final oocyte maturation was performed using 250 g of recombinant hCG , when at least two follicles reached 17 mm in mean diameter ."
2190,RESULTS,"The number of COCs retrieved was not statistically different between the corifollitropin alfa and the follitropin beta groups [ Median 3 versus 2 , 95 % CI 2-4 , 2-3 , respectively , P = 0.26 ] ."
2191,RESULTS,The 95 % CI of the difference between medians in the number of oocytes retrieved was -1 to +1 .
2192,RESULTS,A multivariable analysis adjusting for all the potential baseline differences confirmed this finding .
2193,RESULTS,"No significant difference was observed regarding the probability of live birth between the corifollitropin alfa and the follitropin beta group ( live birth per patient reaching oocyte retrieval : 7.9 versus 2.6 % , respectively , difference +5.3 % , 95 % CI : -6.8 to +18.3 ) ."
2194,CONCLUSIONS,The present study was not powered to test a smaller difference ( e.g. 1 COC ) in terms of COCs retrieved as well as to show potential differences in the probability of pregnancy .
2195,CONCLUSIONS,"Moreover , it would be interesting to assess whether the continuation of stimulation in the long acting FSH arm , where necessary , with 200 IU instead of 450 IU of follitropin beta would have altered the direction or the magnitude of the effect of the type of FSH , observed on the number of COCs retrieved ."
2196,CONCLUSIONS,Corifollitropin alfa simplifies IVF treatment because it is administered in a GnRH antagonist protocol and replaces seven daily FSH injections with a single one of a long acting FSH without compromising the outcome .
2197,CONCLUSIONS,It could greatly reduce the burden of treatment for poor responders and this deserves further investigation .
2198,BACKGROUND,"Recently , a number of studies using intra-articular application of tranexamic acid ( IA-TXA ) , with different dosage and techniques , successfully reduced postoperative blood loss in total knee replacement ( TKR ) ."
2199,BACKGROUND,"However , best of our knowledge , the very low dose of IA-TXA with drain clamping technique in conventional TKR has not been yet studied ."
2200,BACKGROUND,This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and dose-response effect of two low-dose IA-TXA regimens in conventional TKR on blood loss and blood transfusion reduction .
2201,METHODS,"Between 2010 and 2011 , a triple-blinded randomized controlled study was conducted in 135 patients undergoing conventional TKR ."
2202,METHODS,"The patients were allocated into three groups according to intra-articular solution received : Control group ( physiologic saline ) , TXA-250 group ( TXA 250 mg ) , and TXA-500 group ( TXA 500 mg ) ."
2203,METHODS,The solution was injected after wound closure followed by drain clamping for 2 hours .
2204,METHODS,Blood loss and transfusion were recorded .
2205,METHODS,Duplex ultrasound was performed .
2206,METHODS,Functional outcome and complication were followed for one year .
2207,RESULTS,There were forty-five patients per groups .
2208,RESULTS,The mean total hemoglobin loss was 2.9 g/dL in control group compared with 2.2 g/dL in both TXA groups ( p > 0.001 ) .
2209,RESULTS,"Ten patients ( 22 % , control ) , six patients ( 13 % , TXA-250 ) and none ( TXA-500 ) required transfusion ( p = 0.005 ) ."
2210,RESULTS,"Thromboembolic events were detected in 7 patients ( 4 controls , 1 TXA-250 , and 2 TXA-500 ) ."
2211,RESULTS,Functional outcome was non-significant difference between groups .
2212,CONCLUSIONS,"Combined low-dose IA-TXA , as 500 mg , with 2-hour clamp drain is effective for reducing postoperative blood loss and transfusion in conventional TKR without significant difference in postoperative knee function or complication ."

2214,BACKGROUND,"Although previous studies have suggested the potential advantages of albumin administration in patients with severe sepsis , its efficacy has not been fully established ."
2215,METHODS,"In this multicenter , open-label trial , we randomly assigned 1818 patients with severe sepsis , in 100 intensive care units ( ICUs ) , to receive either 20 % albumin and crystalloid solution or crystalloid solution alone ."
2216,METHODS,"In the albumin group , the target serum albumin concentration was 30 g per liter or more until discharge from the ICU or 28 days after randomization ."
2217,METHODS,The primary outcome was death from any cause at 28 days .
2218,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes were death from any cause at 90 days , the number of patients with organ dysfunction and the degree of dysfunction , and length of stay in the ICU and the hospital ."
2219,RESULTS,"During the first 7 days , patients in the albumin group , as compared with those in the crystalloid group , had a higher mean arterial pressure ( P = 0.03 ) and lower net fluid balance ( P < 0.001 ) ."
2220,RESULTS,The total daily amount of administered fluid did not differ significantly between the two groups ( P = 0.10 ) .
2221,RESULTS,"At 28 days , 285 of 895 patients ( 31.8 % ) in the albumin group and 288 of 900 ( 32.0 % ) in the crystalloid group had died ( relative risk in the albumin group , 1.00 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.87 to 1.14 ; P = 0.94 ) ."
2222,RESULTS,"At 90 days , 365 of 888 patients ( 41.1 % ) in the albumin group and 389 of 893 ( 43.6 % ) in the crystalloid group had died ( relative risk , 0.94 ; 95 % CI , 0.85 to 1.05 ; P = 0.29 ) ."
2223,RESULTS,No significant differences in other secondary outcomes were observed between the two groups .
2224,CONCLUSIONS,"In patients with severe sepsis , albumin replacement in addition to crystalloids , as compared with crystalloids alone , did not improve the rate of survival at 28 and 90 days ."

2226,OBJECTIVE,To assess the most effective local analgesia during transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy .
2227,METHODS,A total of 123 consecutive patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy for elevated prostate-specific antigen levels and/or a suspicious digital rectal examination were randomized to three groups .
2228,METHODS,"Patients received a 60-mg lidocaine suppository ( group 1 , n = 41 ) , a periprostatic nerve block ( 10-mL injection of lidocaine hydrochloride ; group 2 , n = 41 ) or a combination of both ( group 3 , n = 41 ) before a 10-core transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy ."
2229,METHODS,"A total of 80.5 % ( n = 99 ) of the patients underwent their first biopsy , 27.1 % ( n = 22 ) their second and 2.4 % ( n = 2 ) the third ."
2230,METHODS,Pain was evaluated on a 10-point visual analog scale for each step of the procedure .
2231,RESULTS,Prostate-specific antigen values ranged from 0.39 to 90.1 ( mean [ SD ] 8.76 ng/mL [ 11.08 ng/mL ] ) .
2232,RESULTS,Comparison of the median visual analog scale scores between groups 1 and 2 showed a significant difference ( P = 0.004 ) .
2233,RESULTS,"The differences in the outcomes between groups 1 and 3 ( P = 0.001 ) , and groups 2 and 3 ( P = 0.001 ) were also significant ."
2234,RESULTS,Patients of group 3 had the best output corresponding to the pain sensations and therefore the lowest visual analog scale scores .
2235,CONCLUSIONS,The combination of lidocaine suppository and periprostatic lidocaine infiltration is more effective for pain control than either lidocaine suppository or periprostatic lidocaine infiltration alone in patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy .
2236,OBJECTIVE,"We hypothesized that arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs using leukocyte - and platelet-rich fibrin ( L-PRF ) in a standardized , modified protocol is technically feasible and results in a higher vascularization response and watertight healing rate during early healing ."
2237,METHODS,Twenty patients with chronic rotator cuff tears were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups .
2238,METHODS,"In the test group ( N = 10 ) , L-PRF was added in between the tendon and the bone during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair ."
2239,METHODS,The second group served as control ( N = 10 ) .
2240,METHODS,They received the same arthroscopic treatment without the use of L-PRF .
2241,METHODS,We used a double-row tension band technique .
2242,METHODS,"Clinical examinations including subjective shoulder value , visual analog scale , Constant , and Simple Shoulder Test scores and measurement of the vascularization with power Doppler ultrasonography were made at 6 and 12 weeks ."
2243,RESULTS,There have been no postoperative complications .
2244,RESULTS,"At 6 and 12 weeks , there was no significant difference in the clinical scores between the test and the control groups ."
2245,RESULTS,The mean vascularization index of the surgical tendon-to-bone insertions was always significantly higher in the L-PRF group than in the contralateral healthy shoulders at 6 and 12 weeks ( P = .0001 ) .
2246,RESULTS,"Whereas the L-PRF group showed a higher vascularization compared with the control group at 6 weeks ( P = .001 ) , there was no difference after 12 weeks of follow-up ( P = .889 ) ."
2247,RESULTS,Watertight healing was obtained in 89 % of the repaired cuffs .
2248,CONCLUSIONS,Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with the application of L-PRF is technically feasible and yields higher early vascularization .
2249,CONCLUSIONS,Increased vascularization may potentially predispose to an increased and earlier cellular response and an increased healing rate .
2250,BACKGROUND,The measurement of mechanosensitivity is a key method for the study of pain in animal models .
2251,BACKGROUND,This is often accomplished with the use of von Frey filaments in an up-down testing paradigm .
2252,BACKGROUND,"The up-down method described by Chaplan et al. ( J Neurosci Methods 53:55 -63 , 1994 ) for mechanosensitivity testing in rodents remains one of the most widely used methods for measuring pain in animals ."
2253,BACKGROUND,"However , this method results in animals receiving a varying number of stimuli , which may lead to animals in different groups receiving different testing experiences that influences their later responses ."
2254,BACKGROUND,To standardize the measurement of mechanosensitivity we developed a simplified up-down method ( SUDO ) for estimating paw withdrawal threshold ( PWT ) with von Frey filaments that uses a constant number of five stimuli per test .
2255,BACKGROUND,"We further refined the PWT calculation to allow the estimation of PWT directly from the behavioral response to the fifth stimulus , omitting the need for look-up tables ."
2256,RESULTS,"The PWT estimates derived using SUDO strongly correlated ( r > 0.96 ) with the PWT estimates determined with the conventional up-down method of Chaplan et al. , and this correlation remained very strong across different levels of tester experience , different experimental conditions , and in tests from both mice and rats ."
2257,RESULTS,The two testing methods also produced similar PWT estimates in prospective behavioral tests of mice at baseline and after induction of hyperalgesia by intraplantar capsaicin or complete Freund 's adjuvant .
2258,CONCLUSIONS,"SUDO thus offers an accurate , fast and user-friendly replacement for the widely used up-down method of Chaplan et al. ."
2259,BACKGROUND,It is unclear if holding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEI ) or angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARB ) prior to coronary angiography reduces contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .
2260,BACKGROUND,We undertook a randomized trial to investigate the effect of holding ACEI/ARB therapy prior to coronary angiography on the incidence of AKI .
2261,METHODS,We randomly assigned 208 patients with moderate renal insufficiency ( creatinine 1.7 mg/dL within 3 months and/or documented creatinine 1.5 mg/dL within 1 week before cardiac catheterization ) to hold ACEI/ARB 24 hours preprocedure or continue ACEI/ARB .
2262,METHODS,The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI defined as an absolute rise in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL from baseline and/or a relative rise in serum creatinine of 25 % compared with baseline measured at 48 to 96 hours postcardiac catheterization .
2263,RESULTS,All patients were taking an ACEI ( 72.1 % ) or ARB ( 27.9 % ) prior to randomization .
2264,RESULTS,"At 48 to 96 hours , the primary outcome occurred in 18.4 % of patients who continued ACEI/ARB compared with 10.9 % of the patients who held ACEI/ARB ( hazard ratio 0.59 , 95 % CI 0.30-1 .19 , P = .16 ) ."
2265,RESULTS,"In a prespecified secondary outcome , there was a lower rise in mean serum creatinine after the procedure in patients who held ACEI/ARB ( 0.3 0.5 vs 0.1 0.3 mg/dL , P = .03 ) ."
2266,RESULTS,"The clinical composite of death , myocardial infarction , ischemic stroke , congestive heart failure , rehospitalization for cardiovascular cause , or need for dialysis preprocedure occurred in 3.9 % who continued ACEI/ARB compared with 0 % who held the ACEI/ARB ( hazard ratio 0.11 , 95 % CI 0.01-2 .96 , P = .06 ) ."
2267,CONCLUSIONS,"In this pilot study of patients with moderate renal insufficiency undergoing cardiac catheterization , with-holding ACEI/ARB resulted in a non-significant reduction in contrast-induced AKI and a significant reduction in post-procedural rise of creatinine ."
2268,CONCLUSIONS,This low cost intervention could be considered when referring a patient for cardiac catheterization .
2269,BACKGROUND,Few studies have evaluated the possible beneficial effect of the administration of stem cells in the early stages of stroke .
2270,BACKGROUND,"Intravenous administration of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) from adipose tissue in patients with acute stroke could be a safe therapy for promoting neurovascular unit repair , consequently supporting better functional recovery ."
2271,BACKGROUND,We aim to assess the safety and efficacy of MSC administration and evaluate its potential as a treatment for cerebral protection and repair .
2272,METHODS,"A Phase IIa , prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-center , pilot clinical trial ."
2273,METHODS,Twenty patients presenting acute ischemic stroke will be randomized in a 1:1 proportion to treatment with allogeneic MSCs from adipose tissue or to placebo ( or vehicle ) administered as a single intravenous dose within the first 2 weeks after the onset of stroke symptoms .
2274,METHODS,The patients will be followed up for 2 years .
2275,METHODS,"Primary outcomes for safety analysis : adverse events ( AEs ) and serious AEs ; neurologic and systemic complications , and tumor development ."
2276,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes for efficacy analysis : modified Rankin Scale ; NIHSS ; infarct size ; and biochemical markers of brain repair ( vascular endothelial growth factor , brain-derived neurotrophic factor , and matrix metalloproteinases 9 ) ."
2277,CONCLUSIONS,"To our knowledge , this is the first , phase II , pilot clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravenous administration of allogeneic MSCs from adipose tissue within the first 2 weeks of stroke ."
2278,CONCLUSIONS,"In addition , its results will help us define the best criteria for a future phase III study ."
2279,OBJECTIVE,This international phase III trial ( Investigating Torisel As Second-Line Therapy [ INTORSECT ] ) compared the efficacy of temsirolimus ( mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor ) and sorafenib ( vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [ VEGFR ] tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) after disease progression on sunitinib .
2280,METHODS,"In total , 512 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive intravenous temsirolimus 25 mg once weekly ( n = 259 ) or oral sorafenib 400 mg twice per day ( n = 253 ) , with stratification according to duration of prior sunitinib therapy ( or > 180 days ) , prognostic risk , histology ( clear cell or non-clear cell ) , and nephrectomy status ."
2281,METHODS,The primary end point was progression-free survival ( PFS ) by independent review committee assessment .
2282,METHODS,"Safety , objective response rate ( ORR ) , and overall survival ( OS ) were secondary end points ."
2283,RESULTS,"Primary analysis revealed no significant difference between treatment arms for PFS ( stratified hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.87 ; 95 % CI , 0.71 to 1.07 ; two-sided P = .19 ) or ORR ."
2284,RESULTS,"Median PFS in the temsirolimus and sorafenib arms were 4.3 and 3.9 months , respectively ."
2285,RESULTS,"There was a significant OS difference in favor of sorafenib ( stratified HR , 1.31 ; 95 % CI , 1.05 to 1.63 ; two-sided P = .01 ) ."
2286,RESULTS,"Median OS in the temsirolimus and sorafenib arms was 12.3 and 16.6 months , respectively ."
2287,RESULTS,Safety profiles of both agents were consistent with previous studies .
2288,CONCLUSIONS,"In patients with mRCC and progression on sunitinib , second-line temsirolimus did not demonstrate a PFS advantage compared with sorafenib ."
2289,CONCLUSIONS,The longer OS observed with sorafenib suggests sequenced VEGFR inhibition may benefit patients with mRCC .
2290,BACKGROUND,Parathyroidectomy in patients with hyperparathyroidism can produce subsequent increases in bone mineral density ( BMD ) .
2291,BACKGROUND,"Ronacaleret , a selective calcium-sensing receptor antagonist that stimulates endogenous parathyroid hormone release , induced mild hyperparathyroidism ."
2292,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study is to evaluate whether BMD changes after cessation of ronacaleret treatment .
2293,METHODS,"Observational , off-treatment , extension of a randomized , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging phase II trial ."
2294,METHODS,Fifteen academic centers in seven countries .
2295,METHODS,Postmenopausal women with low BMD ; 171 out of 569 women in the parent study were enrolled in the extension study .
2296,METHODS,"Subjects were treated with ronacaleret 100mg ( n = 16 ) , 200mg ( n = 38 ) , 300mg ( n = 35 ) , or 400mg ( n = 32 ) once daily , alendronate 70mg ( n = 17 ) once weekly , or matching placebo ( n = 33 ) for 10-12months ; BMD was measured after discontinuation of ronacaleret or alendronate treatment ."
2297,METHODS,Mean percent change in lumbar spine areal BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at 6-12months after discontinuing ronacaleret or alendronate compared with the 10 - to 12-month BMD measurement of the parent study .
2298,RESULTS,"At the lumbar spine , all doses of ronacaleret resulted in gains in BMD while on treatment ."
2299,RESULTS,These increases in BMD were maintained or increased after discontinuation of ronacaleret .
2300,RESULTS,All doses of ronacaleret caused bone loss at the total hip while on active treatment .
2301,RESULTS,"However , there was an attenuation of this loss in the off-treatment extension study ."
2302,CONCLUSIONS,The gain in BMD at the lumbar spine was maintained post-treatment and the loss of BMD at the total hip was attenuated .
2303,CONCLUSIONS,We hypothesize that there may have been some bone remineralization after cessation of ronacaleret .
2304,OBJECTIVE,"To study the influence of aerobic exercise training on brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , insulin resistance , and lipid profile in middle-aged men diagnosed with metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) ."
2305,METHODS,This is an experimental repeated measure study .
2306,METHODS,Subjects participated in aerobic training programs ( 18 sessions of 25-40 minutes per session ) in Guilan University gymnasium and court .
2307,METHODS,A total of 21 middle-aged men ( 50-65 years old ) diagnosed with MetS participated .
2308,METHODS,We randomly divided 21 middle-aged men with MetS into exercise and control groups .
2309,METHODS,"The exercise group followed an aerobic training program ( 18 sessions , 3/wk ) at 50 % to 60 % of V [ Combining Dot Above ] O2 peak ( 25-40 minutes per session ) and 6 weeks of detraining ."
2310,METHODS,"Blood samples were collected at baseline , end of the training , and detraining ."
2311,METHODS,High BDNF level in patients with MetS and its reduction after chronic aerobic exercise .
2312,RESULTS,"Aerobic training significantly decreased all the metabolic risk factors , including overall MetS z score , insulin resistance , and lipid profile ( P < 0.05 ) ."
2313,RESULTS,"After the detraining period , plasma triglyceride , high-density lipoprotein , and also overall MetS z score remained unchanged ( P < 0.05 ) ; however , serum BDNF , which was decreased by aerobic training ( P = 0.013 ) , restored to the baseline at the end of the detraining ( P = 0.018 ) ."
2314,CONCLUSIONS,Improved metabolic risk factors along with decreased serum BDNF in response to aerobic training and the opposite direction during the detraining emphasize the importance of physical activity in the treatment of MetS and prevention of related diseases .
2315,OBJECTIVE,The aims of this study were to compare strut tissue coverage at six-month follow-up after Nobori biolimus-eluting stent ( N-BES ) versus sirolimus-eluting stent ( SES ) implantation .
2316,RESULTS,A total of 120 patients with a single stenotic lesion requiring revascularisation were randomly assigned to either N-BES ( n = 60 ) or SES ( n = 60 ) .
2317,RESULTS,"Baseline optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) was performed post stent implantation , and follow-up OCT was scheduled at six months ."
2318,RESULTS,"Post-intervention and follow-up OCT analyses were available in 51 ( 85.0 % ) and 52 ( 86.7 % ) patients , respectively ."
2319,RESULTS,The primary endpoint was the percentage of uncovered struts at follow-up OCT in all cross-sections with analysis of 0.2 mm longitudinal intervals .
2320,RESULTS,"In addition , an OCT contour plot analysis was constructed to investigate the distribution patterns of uncovered struts ."
2321,RESULTS,"The percentage of uncovered struts of N-BES was significantly lower versus SES ( 15.912.2 % versus 25.118.3 % , respectively , p = 0.003 ) ."
2322,RESULTS,"N-BES showed a greater NIH thickness than SES ( median [ interquartile range ] 52.4 m [ 41.9-74 .9 ] versus 42.1 m [ 30.6-56 .0 ] , p = 0.005 ) ."
2323,RESULTS,"Contour plot analyses showed a lower incidence of a diffuse distribution pattern of uncovered struts ( 46.8 % versus 75.0 % , respectively , p = 0.022 ) ."
2324,CONCLUSIONS,"This randomised OCT study showed that N-BES had a significantly lower percentage of uncovered struts , and less common diffuse distribution pattern of uncovered struts versus SES ."
2325,OBJECTIVE,To explore the necessity of interrupting nerve fibers of bypass thoracic sympathetic chain during edoscopic sympathicotomy ( ETS ) for palmar hyperhidrosis .
2326,METHODS,Randomized controlled trial was performed for 200 patients of severe palmar hyperhidrosis from January 2009 to June 2011 .
2327,METHODS,They were randomly divided into 2 groups of R3 thoracic sympathctomy ( R3 ) and R3 thoracic sympathicotomy plus bypass fiber resection at the same level ( R3 + ) ( n = 100 each ) .
2328,METHODS,Clinical observations were recorded during a follow-up period of 3 years .
2329,RESULTS,The curative rates of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis were 100 % for two groups .
2330,RESULTS,"No statistically significant inter-group difference existed in left hand temperature increase after transecting thoracic sympathetic nerve ( 3.6 1.4 C vs 3.5 1.3 C ) , right hand increase ( 3.8 1.3 C vs 3.9 1.1 C ) , incidence of compensatory hyperhidrosis ( 40 % vs 44 % ) , recurrence rate ( 1 % vs 2 % ) and postoperative satisfaction rate ( 92 % vs 90 % ) ."
2331,RESULTS,"But pain scores of R3 group was significantly lower than those of R3 + group ( 3.0 1.9 vs 3.6 1.9 , P < 0.05 ) ."
2332,CONCLUSIONS,Simple transaction of thoracic sympathetic chain during ETS is sufficient in the treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis .
2333,CONCLUSIONS,And it is unnecessary to transect bypass fibers .
2334,OBJECTIVE,Most blood donors stop donating blood at the beginning of their donor career .
2335,OBJECTIVE,This intervention study aims to increase first-time return behaviour of newly registered donors using implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques .
2336,METHODS,Newly registered donors ( N = 937 ) received an extra information sheet during their medical check-up wherein implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques were tested .
2337,METHODS,"Donors were randomly assigned to either the control condition , information sheet only condition , information sheet with implementation intentions condition , information sheet with explicit commitment condition , or information sheet with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition ."
2338,METHODS,Logistic regression analyses examined actual first-time return behaviour after an appeal to donate blood .
2339,RESULTS,Donors in the information sheet with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition had an 11.5 % higher return rate than donors in the control condition .
2340,RESULTS,"Logistic regression analyses revealed that the information sheet with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition significantly increased the odds on return behaviour compared with the control condition ( OR = 1.65 , 95 % CI = 1.08-2 .50 ) ."
2341,CONCLUSIONS,This study successfully increased actual first-time return behaviour of newly registered donors by using both implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques .
2342,OBJECTIVE,The prognoses of symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis ( ICAS ) differ .
2343,OBJECTIVE,Understanding the underlying pathomechanisms and predictors of progression or regression may help to clarify the differences .
2344,OBJECTIVE,We herein attempted to compare the course and predictors of symptomatic ICAS to those of coexisting asymptomatic ICAS .
2345,METHODS,"This was a post-hoc analysis of the ` Trials of Cilostazol in Symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis-2 ( TOSS-2 ) ' study , which recruited patients with acute symptomatic ICAS receiving intensive medical treatment ."
2346,METHODS,"Changes in the status of ICAS were classified as being indicative of regression , progression or no changes ."
2347,METHODS,"Univariate and multivariate ordinal regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of symptomatic and asymptomatic ICAS based on clinical , laboratory and radiologic data ."
2348,RESULTS,"Of the 409 patients , symptomatic ICAS demonstrated regression in 110 ( 27 % ) cases and progression in 52 ( 13 % ) cases ."
2349,RESULTS,"Among these patients , 250 ( 61.1 % ) had asymptomatic ICAS , which regressed in 38 ( 15 % ) cases and progressed in 16 ( 6 % ) cases ."
2350,RESULTS,"Severe baseline stenosis , a high high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol level and the use of cilostazol were found to be independently associated with a favorable course of symptomatic ICAS ( p0 .001 , p = 0.005 and p = 0.038 , respectively ) ."
2351,RESULTS,"Regarding asymptomatic ICAS , severe stenosis , the use of angiotensin receptor antagonists and a low fasting glucose level were associated with a favorable course ( p0 .001 , p = 0.011 and p = 0.007 , respectively ) ."
2352,CONCLUSIONS,"Changes in atherosclerosis are more dynamic in patients with symptomatic ICAS , and the predictors of symptomatic and asymptomatic ICAS differ ."
2353,CONCLUSIONS,"In this study , changes in the status of symptomatic ICAS were associated with the level of HDL cholesterol , which is known to affect the regression of atherosclerosis and vascular remodeling ."
2354,BACKGROUND,Selective neck dissection ( SND ) in clinical N0 ( cN0 ) cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) has been performed by surgeons using a retroauricular or modified facelift approach with robotic or endoscopic assistance .
2355,BACKGROUND,"However , these procedures provide cosmetic satisfaction at the cost of possible maximal invasiveness ."
2356,BACKGROUND,"In this prospective study , we introduced and evaluated the feasibility as well as surgical invasiveness and cosmetic outcome of endoscopically-assisted SND via a small submandibular approach ."
2357,METHODS,Forty-four patients with cT1-2N0 oral SCC ( OSCC ) were randomly divided into two groups of endoscopically-assisted SND and conventional SND .
2358,METHODS,"Perioperative and postoperative outcomes of patients were evaluated , including the length of the incision , operating time for neck dissection , estimated blood loss during the operation , amount and duration of drainage , total hospitalization period , total number of lymph nodes retrieved , satisfaction scores based on the cosmetic results , perioperative local complications , shoulder syndrome , and follow-up information ."
2359,RESULTS,The mean operation time in the endoscopically-assisted group ( 126.0412.67 min ) was longer than that in the conventional group ( 75.6716.67 min ) .
2360,RESULTS,"However , the mean length of the incision was 4.330.76 cm in the endoscopically-assisted SND group , and the amount and duration of drainage , total hospital stay , postoperative shoulder pain score , and cosmetic outcomes were superior in the endoscopically-assisted SND group ."
2361,RESULTS,"Additionally , the retrieved lymph nodes and complications were comparable ."
2362,CONCLUSIONS,Endoscopically-assisted SND via a small submandibular approach had a longer operation time than the conventional approach .
2363,CONCLUSIONS,"However , endoscopically-assisted SND was feasible and reliable while providing minimal invasiveness and satisfactory appearance ."
2364,BACKGROUND,The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 98-11 clinical trial demonstrated the superiority of standard 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin-C over 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin in combination with radiation in the treatment of anal squamous cell cancer .

2404,METHODS,The treatment differences at one month and one year were analysed using ANCOVA with adjustment for the baseline score .
2405,RESULTS,"The mean difference ( MD ) between the groups in the primary outcome , intensity of LBP , was 1.4 ( 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) 0.01 to 2.9 ) in favour of ZA at one month ."
2406,RESULTS,We observed no significant between-group difference in the intensity of LBP at one year ( MD 0.7 ; 95 % CI -1.0 to 2.4 ) or in secondary outcomes at any time point except that 20 % of patients in the ZA group used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at one year compared to 60 % in the placebo group ( P = 0.022 ) .
2407,RESULTS,"Acute phase reactions ( fever , flu-like symptoms , arthralgia ) emerged in 95 % of the patients in the ZA group , compared to 35 % in the placebo group ."

2431,BACKGROUND,Detection of atrial fibrillation after cryptogenic stroke has therapeutic implications .
2432,METHODS,"We conducted a randomized , controlled study of 441 patients to assess whether long-term monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor ( ICM ) is more effective than conventional follow-up ( control ) for detecting atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke ."
2433,METHODS,Patients 40 years of age or older with no evidence of atrial fibrillation during at least 24 hours of ECG monitoring underwent randomization within 90 days after the index event .
2434,METHODS,The primary end point was the time to first detection of atrial fibrillation ( lasting > 30 seconds ) within 6 months .
2435,METHODS,Among the secondary end points was the time to first detection of atrial fibrillation within 12 months .
2436,METHODS,Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle .

2451,RESULTS,Statistically significant differences between the 2 techniques were found with respect to the outcome measures of household chores and outdoor work .
2452,CONCLUSIONS,"Ultrasound-guided piriformis injections provide similar outcomes to fluoroscopically guided injections without differences in imaging , needling , or overall procedural times ."
2453,OBJECTIVE,The cost implications of the Outcome Reduction with an Initial Glargine Intervention ( ORIGIN ) trial were evaluated using a prespecified analysis plan .
2454,METHODS,Purchasing power parity-adjusted country-specific costs were applied to consumed healthcare resources by participants from each country .
2455,METHODS,Subgroup analyses were conducted on subgroups based on baseline metabolic status and diabetes duration .
2456,RESULTS,"The total undiscounted cost per participant in the insulin glargine arm was $ 13,491 ( $ 13,080 to $ 14,254 ) versus $ 11,189 ( $ 10,568 to $ 12,147 ) for standard care , an increase of $ 2303 ( $ 1370 to $ 3235 ; p < 0.0001 ) ; the discounted increase was $ 2099 ( $ 1276 to $ 2923 ; P < 0.0001 ) ."
2457,RESULTS,The greater number of mainly generic oral anti-diabetic agents in the standard group partially offset the higher cost of basal insulin glargine .
2458,RESULTS,"As the trial progressed and the standard group required more anti-diabetic medications , the annual cost difference decreased , reaching $ 68 ( - $ 160 to $ 295 ) in the last year ."
2459,RESULTS,The subgroup whose baseline diabetes duration was 6 years achieved cost-savings during the trial .
2460,CONCLUSIONS,From a global perspective basal insulin glargine use in ORIGIN incurred greater costs than standard care using older generic drugs .
2461,CONCLUSIONS,"Nevertheless , the cost difference fell with time such that the intervention was cost-neutral by the last year ."

2463,OBJECTIVE,This randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of SCIT among persons with serious mental illness living in community settings in Israel .
2464,METHODS,Fifty-five participants in social-mentoring services were assigned randomly to SCIT with social mentoring or to social mentoring only .
2465,METHODS,"Emotion recognition , theory of mind , attributional bias , and social functioning were assessed at baseline ( February 2010 ) and about six months later , upon completion of the intervention ."
2466,RESULTS,Interactions between time of measurement and group were significant for theory of mind and social engagement .
2467,RESULTS,"Emotion recognition by the SCIT group improved significantly , but the time group interaction for this variable was not significant ."
2468,CONCLUSIONS,This study provides preliminary evidence that SCIT plus social mentoring improves social cognition and functioning among persons with severe mental illness who are living in the community .
2469,BACKGROUND,Health-related and disease-specific quality of life ( HRQoL ) has been increasingly valued as relevant clinical parameter in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) clinical care and clinical trials .
2470,BACKGROUND,HRQoL measures should assess - among other domains - daily functioning from a patient 's perspective .
2471,BACKGROUND,"However , validation studies for the most frequently used HRQoL questionnaire in CF , the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire ( CFQ ) , have not included measures of physical activity or fitness ."
2472,BACKGROUND,"The objective of this study was , therefore , to determine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between HRQoL , physical activity and fitness in patients with CF."
2473,METHODS,"Baseline ( n = 76 ) and 6-month follow-up data ( n = 70 ) from patients with CF ( age 12 years , FEV1 35 % ) were analysed ."
2474,METHODS,Patients participated in two multi-centre exercise intervention studies with identical assessment methodology .
2475,METHODS,"Outcome variables included HRQoL ( German revised multi-dimensional disease-specific CFQ ( CFQ-R ) ) , body composition , pulmonary function , physical activity , short-term muscle power , and aerobic fitness by peak oxygen uptake and aerobic power ."
2476,RESULTS,Peak oxygen uptake was positively related to 7 of 13 HRQoL scales cross-sectionally ( r = 0.30-0 .46 ) .
2477,RESULTS,"Muscle power ( r = 0.25-0 .32 ) and peak aerobic power ( r = 0.24-0 .35 ) were positively related to 4 scales each , and reported physical activity to 1 scale ( r = 0.29 ) ."
2478,RESULTS,"Changes in HRQoL-scores were directly and significantly related to changes in reported activity ( r = 0.35-0 .39 ) , peak aerobic power ( r = 0.31-0 .34 ) , and peak oxygen uptake ( r = 0.26-0 .37 ) in 3 scales each ."
2479,RESULTS,Established associates of HRQoL such as FEV1 or body mass index correlated positively with fewer scales ( all 0.24 < r < 0.55 ) .
2480,CONCLUSIONS,"HRQoL was associated with physical fitness , especially aerobic fitness , and to a lesser extent with reported physical activity ."
2481,CONCLUSIONS,These findings underline the importance of physical fitness for HRQoL in CF and provide an additional rationale for exercise testing in this population .

2504,BACKGROUND,"However , why and how certain tasks positively ` drive ' learning remain unknown ."
2505,BACKGROUND,Medical tasks can be assessed as coherent meaningful whole tasks ( e.g. examining a patient based on his complaint to find the diagnosis ) or can be divided into simpler part tasks ( e.g. demonstrating the physical examination of a pre-specified disease ) .
2506,BACKGROUND,Comparing the benefits of whole-task and part-task assessments in a randomised controlled experiment could guide the design of ` assessments for learning ' .
2507,OBJECTIVE,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether the knowledge that an objective structured clinical examination ( OSCE ) will contain whole tasks , as opposed to part tasks , increases the use of diagnostic reasoning by medical students when they study for this assessment ."
2508,METHODS,"In this randomised , controlled , mixed-methods experiment , 40 medical students were randomly paired and filmed while studying together for two imminent physical examination OSCE stations ."
2509,METHODS,Each 25-minute study period began with video cues and ended with a questionnaire on cognitive loads .
2510,METHODS,Cues disclosed either a part-task OSCE station ( examination of a healthy patient ) or a whole-task OSCE station ( hypothesis-driven physical examination [ HDPE ] ) .
2511,METHODS,"In a crossover design , sequences were randomised for both task and content ( shoulder or spine ) ."
2512,METHODS,"Two blinded and independent authors scored all 40 videos in distinct randomised orders , listening to participants studying freely ."

2689,RESULTS,"Between May 22 , 2012 , and Oct 14 , 2013 , 1416 patients were screened for eligibility , 106 of those were randomly assigned to treatment ( 53 patients in each group , intention-to-treat population ) and 101 analysed because of patients with missing endpoints ( 48 in the renal denervation group , 53 in the control group , modified intention-to-treat population ) ."
2690,RESULTS,"The mean change in daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure at 6 months was -158 mm Hg ( 95 % CI -197 to -119 ) in the renal denervation group and -99 mm Hg ( -136 to -62 ) in the group receiving SSAHT alone , a baseline-adjusted difference of -59 mm Hg ( -113 to -05 ; p = 00329 ) ."
2691,RESULTS,The number of antihypertensive drugs and drug-adherence at 6 months were similar between the two groups .
2692,RESULTS,Three minor renal denervation-related adverse events were noted ( lumbar pain in two patients and mild groin haematoma in one patient ) .
2693,RESULTS,A mild and similar decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to 6 months was observed in both groups .
2694,CONCLUSIONS,"In patients with well defined resistant hypertension , renal denervation plus an SSAHT decreases ambulatory blood pressure more than the same SSAHT alone at 6 months ."
2695,CONCLUSIONS,This additional blood pressure lowering effect may contribute to a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity if maintained in the long term after renal denervation .

2697,BACKGROUND,Previously published research that examined the effects of high egg consumption in people with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) produced conflicting results leading to recommendations to limit egg intake .
2698,BACKGROUND,"However , people with T2D may benefit from egg consumption because eggs are a nutritious and convenient way of improving protein and micronutrient contents of the diet , which have importance for satiety and weight management ."
2699,OBJECTIVE,"In this randomized controlled study , we aimed to determine whether a high-egg diet ( 2 eggs/d for 6 d/wk ) compared with a low-egg diet ( < 2 eggs/wk ) affected circulating lipid profiles , in particular high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , in overweight or obese people with prediabetes or T2D ."
2700,METHODS,A total of 140 participants were randomly assigned to one of the 2 diets as part of a 3-mo weight maintenance study .

2951,BACKGROUND,The relationship between tobacco and cannabis use is strong .
2952,BACKGROUND,"When co-smokers try to quit only one substance , this relationship often leads to a substitution effect , that is , the increased use of the remaining substance ."
2953,BACKGROUND,"Stopping the use of both substances simultaneously is therefore a reasonable strategy , but co-smokers rarely report feeling ready for simultaneous cessation ."
2954,BACKGROUND,"Thus , the question of how co-smokers can be motivated to attempt a simultaneous cessation has arisen ."
2955,BACKGROUND,"To reach as many co-smokers as possible , we developed brief Web-based interventions aimed at enhancing the readiness to simultaneously quit tobacco and cannabis use ."
2956,OBJECTIVE,Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of three different Web-based interventions designed to enhance co-smokers ' readiness to stop tobacco and cannabis use simultaneously .
2957,METHODS,"Within a randomized trial , three brief Web-based and fully automated interventions were compared ."
2958,METHODS,"The first intervention combined the assessment of cigarette dependence and problematic cannabis use with personalized , normative feedback ."
2959,METHODS,The second intervention was based on principles of motivational interviewing .
2960,METHODS,"As an active psychoeducational control group , the third intervention merely provided information on tobacco , cannabis , and the co-use of the two substances ."
2961,METHODS,The readiness to quit tobacco and cannabis simultaneously was measured before and after the intervention ( both online ) and 8 weeks later ( online or over the phone ) .
2962,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes included the frequency of cigarette and cannabis use , as measured at baseline and after 8 weeks ."
2963,RESULTS,"A total of 2467 website users were assessed for eligibility based on their self-reported tobacco and cannabis co-use , and 325 participants were ultimately randomized and analyzed ."
2964,RESULTS,"For the post-intervention assessment , generalized estimating equations revealed a significant increase in the readiness to quit tobacco and cannabis in the total sample ( B = .33 , 95 % CI 0.10-0 .56 , P = .006 ) ."
2965,RESULTS,"However , this effect was not significant for the comparison between baseline and the 8-week follow-up assessment ( P = .69 ) ."
2966,RESULTS,"Furthermore , no differential effects between the interventions were found , nor were any significant intervention or time effects found on the frequency of tobacco or cannabis use ."
2967,CONCLUSIONS,"In the new field of dual interventions for co-smokers of tobacco and cannabis , Web-based interventions can increase the short-term readiness to quit tobacco and cannabis simultaneously ."
2968,CONCLUSIONS,The studied personalized techniques were no more effective than was psychoeducation .
2969,CONCLUSIONS,"The analyzed brief interventions did not change the secondary outcomes , that is the frequency of tobacco and cannabis use ."

3003,OBJECTIVE,To examine the effect of repeated-sprint training ( RST ) vs combined RST and resistance training with superimposed vibrations on repeated-sprint ability ( RSA ) and lower-body power output in male rugby players .
3004,METHODS,Players were divided into 2 training groups .
3005,METHODS,One group performed RST ( n = 10 ) 2 d/wk and the other performed RST 1 d/wk and squat resistance training with superimposed vibrations on the second day ( RS+ST ; n = 10 ) .
3006,METHODS,"The squat training was carried out with a volume similar ( ie , number of sets and repetitions ) to that of the RST ."

3009,RESULTS,Substantial improvements in RSA best time ( RSA ( best ) ; +2.6 % / ES : 0.61 ) and squat power output normalized to body mass ( +18.6 % / ES : 0.76 ) only occurred in RS+ST .
3010,RESULTS,Both pretest and posttest RSA ( mean ) were largely correlated with the RSA ( best ) .
3011,RESULTS,"However , there were only unclear , small to moderate correlations between individual changes in squat power output and either RSA ( mean ) or RSA ( best ) ."
3012,CONCLUSIONS,Combined RST and resistance training induced improvements of greater magnitude in both repeated-sprint performance and muscle power output than the RST alone .
3013,CONCLUSIONS,The lack of substantial correlations between individual changes in repeated-sprint and muscle-power performance suggests that the same subjects were not systematically low or high responders to both RST and strength training .
3014,BACKGROUND,The relative performance of ART sealant and fluoride-releasing resin sealant in preventing fissure caries in permanent molars was compared in a randomized clinical trial conducted in southern China ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01829334 ) .
3015,METHODS,"After obtaining ethical approval , healthy schoolchildren who had permanent first molars with occlusal fissures which were sound but deep or presented with only incipient caries were recruited for the study ."
3016,METHODS,Included molars were randomly allocated into one of four parallel study groups in units of left/right teeth per mouth .
3017,METHODS,Two of the four groups adopted the methods of ART or fluoride-releasing resin sealant placement while the other two groups adopted the topical fluoride application methods .
3018,METHODS,Fissure status of the molars in each group was evaluated every 6 months .
3019,METHODS,Development of dentine caries and sealant retention over 24 months in the molars in the two sealant-using groups was compared in this report .

3023,RESULTS,"Proportions of molars with dentine caries were 7.3 % and 3.9 % in the ART sealant and fluoride-releasing resin sealant groups , respectively ( chi-square test , p = 0.171 ) ."
3024,RESULTS,Life-table survival analysis showed that sealant retention ( full and partial ) rate over 24 months for the resin sealant ( 73 % ) was significantly higher than that ( 50 % ) for the ART sealant ( p < 0.001 ) .
3025,RESULTS,Molar survival ( no development of dentine caries ) rates in the ART sealant ( 93 % ) and fluoride-releasing resin sealant ( 96 % ) groups were not significantly different ( p = 0.169 ) .
3026,RESULTS,Multilevel logistic regression ( GEE modeling ) accounting for the effects of data clustering and confounding factors confirmed this finding .
3027,CONCLUSIONS,"Though the retention of fluoride-releasing resin sealant was better than that of the ART sealant , their effectiveness in preventing fissure caries in permanent molars did not differ significantly over 24 months ."
3028,CONCLUSIONS,ART sealants could be a good alternative when and where resources for resin sealant placement are not readily available .

3073,METHODS,"Healthy adults ( n = 50 ) were randomized in a crossover study to receive two different ER-ASA single doses ( up to 325 mg ) and two different IR-ASA single doses ( up to 81 mg ) in four periods , each separated by 14 days ."
3074,METHODS,"Pharmacodynamics was assessed by measuring serum thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) , urine 11-dehydro-TXB2 , and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation ."
3075,METHODS,Pharmacokinetics was determined for ASA and salicylic acid ( SA ) .
3076,RESULTS,Both formulations produced dose-dependent inhibition on all pharmacodynamic parameters .
3077,RESULTS,Marked inhibition of TXB2 and 11-dehydro-TXB2 was maintained over the 24-h dosing interval after a dose of 81 mg ER-ASA or 40 mg IR-ASA .
3078,RESULTS,"The dose required to achieve 50 % of maximum TXB2 inhibition with ER-ASA was 49.9 mg versus 29.6 mg for IR-ASA , for a similar maximum pharmacodynamic effect ( 98.9 % TXB2 inhibition ) ."
3079,RESULTS,This suggests that an approximately twofold greater ER-ASA dose ( 162.5 mg ) is necessary to obtain the same response as that of IR-ASA 81 mg .
3080,RESULTS,Peak ASA concentrations were lower and Tmax was longer with ER-ASA versus IR-ASA .
3081,RESULTS,Administration of IR-ASA resulted in a dose-normalized mean Cmax of ASA that was approximately sixfold higher than that for ER-ASA and a Cmax of SA approximately two - to threefold higher than that for ER-ASA .
3082,CONCLUSIONS,Both ASA formulations showed dose-dependent antiplatelet activity .
3083,CONCLUSIONS,"Compared with the IR-ASA , ER-ASA released active drug more slowly , resulting in prolonged absorption and lower systemic drug concentrations , which is expected for an ER ( 24-h ) formulation ."
3084,BACKGROUND,"In our hospital , lumbar epidural analgesia had been used for postoperative analgesia following vaginal total hysterectomy ( VTH ) ."
3085,BACKGROUND,But some patients experienced severe abdominal pain or numbness of the legs .
3086,BACKGROUND,Therefore we planned a randomized prospective study to compare lower thoracic epidural analgesia and lumbar epidural analgesia following VTH .
3087,METHODS,Fifty patients were allocated to two groups : those who received lower thoracic epidural analgesia ( T group ) and the other who received lumbar epidural analgesia ( L group ) .
3088,METHODS,Both groupsreceived the same continuous epidural analgesia using fentanyl and ropivacaine after the operation .
3089,RESULTS,"The T group required significantly lower frequency of analgesic agents compared with that of the L group ( 2.51.9 times vs. 1.21.1 times , P < 0.05 ) ."
3090,RESULTS,"Fewer patients in the T group had felt numbness in their legs compared to the L group ( 8 % vs. 55 % , P < 0.05 ) ."
3091,CONCLUSIONS,Lower thoracic epidural analgesia is more effective to provide postoperative analgesic effect following VTH compared with lumbar epidural analgesia .
3092,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate changes in corneal epithelial and stromal thickness after corneal collagen cross-linking ( CXL ) in eyes with keratoconus and postoperative corneal ectasia using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) .
3093,METHODS,"Anterior segment SD-OCT ( RTVue-100 ; Optovue , Inc. , Fremont , CA ) was used to compare regional corneal epithelial and stromal thickness in eyes with keratoconus and ectasia before CXL and 1 and 3 months after CXL ."
3094,METHODS,"The anterior surface of the cornea , epithelium-Bowman 's layer interface , and posterior reflective surface were used as anatomical landmarks to measure epithelial and stromal thickness , respectively ."
3095,METHODS,Regional thickness was assessed centrally and at 21 points 0.5 mm apart across the central 6 mm of the corneal vertex in the horizontal and vertical meridians .
3096,RESULTS,"Thirty-one eyes from 30 patients were evaluated , including 17 eyes ( 17 patients ) with keratoconus and 14 eyes ( 13 patients ) with ectasia ."
3097,RESULTS,"Preoperatively , a highly irregular epithelial thickness profile and distribution was observed in both groups ."
3098,RESULTS,"After CXL , epithelial thickness was significantly thinner 2.5 and 2 mm below and 1.5 mm above the corneal apex ( 49.26 5.69 m ; range : 43 to 62 m ) , and 2.5 and 1 mm nasal and 2 mm temporal to the corneal apex ( 46.66 4.53 m ; range : 39 to 57 m ) compared to preoperative values ( P < .05 for all measurements ) ."
3099,RESULTS,"Epithelial thickness standard deviations were significantly lower ( by 3 to 6 m ) 3 months after CXL , compared to ranges before CXL in both the vertical and horizontal meridians for keratoconus and ectasia ( P = .048 ) ."
3100,RESULTS,No significant differences were found between epithelial remodeling in keratoconus and corneal ectasia ( P = .98 ) .
3101,RESULTS,No significant or consistent stromal changes were found for either group .
3102,CONCLUSIONS,"Significant epithelial remodeling occurs after CXL in eyes with keratoconus and corneal ectasia , creating a similar , more regularized thickness profile in all meridians in the early postoperative period ."
3103,CONCLUSIONS,This pattern of remodeling may facilitate interpretation of corneal curvature and thickness changes after CXL and may be related to visual acuity after CXL .

3250,BACKGROUND,Decreased ability of muscles to respond to anabolic stimuli is part of the underlying mechanism for muscle loss with aging .
3251,BACKGROUND,"Previous studies suggest that substantial amounts of essential amino acids ( EAA ) , whey protein and leucine are beneficial for stimulation of acute muscle protein synthesis in older adults ."
3252,BACKGROUND,"However , these studies supplied only proteins , and no bolus studies have been done with dairy products or supplements that contained also fat and carbohydrates besides proteins ."
3253,BACKGROUND,The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a specifically designed nutritional supplement in older adults stimulates muscle protein synthesis acutely to a greater extent than a conventional dairy product .
3254,BACKGROUND,"Moreover , the combined effect with resistance exercise was studied by using a unilateral resistance exercise protocol ."
3255,METHODS,"Utilizing a randomized , controlled , double blind study design , healthy older adults received a single bolus of a high whey protein , leucine-enriched supplement ( EXP : 20 g whey protein , 3g total leucine , 150 kcal ; n = 9 ) or an iso-caloric milk protein control ("
3256,METHODS,"6g milk protein ; n = 10 ) , immediately after unilateral resistance exercise ."
3257,METHODS,Postprandial mixed muscle protein fractional synthesis rate ( FSR ) was measured over 4h using a tracer infusion protocol with L - [ ring-C ] - phenylalanine and regular blood and muscle sampling .
3258,RESULTS,FSR was significantly higher overall after EXP ( 0.07800.0070 % / h ) vs CONTROL ( 0.05740.0066 % / h ( EMMSE ) ) ( p = 0.049 ) .
3259,RESULTS,No interaction between treatment and exercise was observed ( p = 0.519 ) .
3260,RESULTS,"Higher postprandial concentrations of EAA and leucine are possible mediating factors for the FSR response , while plasma insulin increase did not dictate the FSR response ."
3261,RESULTS,"Moreover , when the protein intake from the supplements was expressed per kg leg lean mass ( LLM ) , a significant correlation was observed with resting postprandial FSR ( r = 0.48 , P = 0.038 ) ."
3262,CONCLUSIONS,"Ingestion of a high whey protein , leucine-enriched supplement resulted in a larger overall postprandial muscle protein synthesis rate in healthy older subjects compared with a conventional dairy product ."
3263,CONCLUSIONS,"This acute effect is promising for long-term effects on parameters of muscle mass , strength and function in sarcopenic older people , which requires further study ."

3272,RESULTS,"Short-term , both groups increased their physical activity time , and the PA group maintained this increase at the medium-term ."
3273,CONCLUSIONS,"Participants in the HW group achieved modest improvements in weight , and those in the PA group demonstrated increased physical activity ."
3274,CONCLUSIONS,"Low-contact , telephone-based interventions are a feasible means of delivering lifestyle interventions for underserved rural communities , for those not attending cardiac rehabilitation , or as an adjunct to cardiac rehabilitation ."
3275,OBJECTIVE,To compare the kinematics of lower limb joints between individuals with and without chronic ankle instability ( CAI ) during cross-turn and - cutting movements .
3276,METHODS,Cross-sectional study .
3277,METHODS,Motion analysis laboratory .
3278,METHODS,Twelve subjects with CAI and twelve healthy controls .
3279,METHODS,"Hip flexion , adduction , and internal rotation , knee flexion , and ankle dorsiflexion and inversion angles were calculated in the 200ms before initial ground contact and from initial ground contact to toe-off ( stance phase ) in a cross-turn movement during gait and a cross-cutting movement from a forward jump , and compared across the two groups ."
3280,RESULTS,"In the cross-cutting movement , the CAI group exhibited greater hip and knee flexion than the control group during the stance phase , and more hip abduction during the period before initial contact and the stance phase ."
3281,RESULTS,In the cross-turn movement the joint kinematics were similar in the two groups .
3282,CONCLUSIONS,CAI subjects exhibited an altered pattern of the proximal joint kinematics during a cross-cutting movement .
3283,CONCLUSIONS,"It is important for clinicians to assess the function of the hip and knee as well as the ankle , and to incorporate coordination training for the entire lower limb into rehabilitation after lateral ankle sprains ."
3284,BACKGROUND,"It is thought that therapy should be functional , be highly repetitive , and promote afferent input to best stimulate hand motor recovery after stroke , yet patients struggle to access such therapy ."
3285,BACKGROUND,"We developed the MusicGlove , an instrumented glove that requires the user to practice gripping-like movements and thumb-finger opposition to play a highly engaging , music-based , video game ."
3286,BACKGROUND,The purpose of this study was to 1 ) compare the effect of training with MusicGlove to conventional hand therapy 2 ) determine if MusicGlove training was more effective than a matched form of isometric hand movement training ; and 3 ) determine if MusicGlove game scores predict clinical outcomes .
3287,METHODS,"12 chronic stroke survivors with moderate hemiparesis were randomly assigned to receive MusicGlove , isometric , and conventional hand therapy in a within-subjects design ."
3288,METHODS,"Each subject participated in six one-hour treatment sessions three times per week for two weeks , for each training type , for a total of 18 treatment sessions ."
3289,METHODS,A blinded rater assessed hand impairment before and after each training type and at one-month follow-up including the Box and Blocks ( B & B ) test as the primary outcome measure .
3290,METHODS,Subjects also completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory ( IMI ) .
3291,RESULTS,"Subjects improved hand function related to grasping small objects more after MusicGlove compared to conventional training , as measured by the B & B score ( improvement of 3.213.82 vs. -0.292.27 blocks ; P = 0.010 ) and the 9 Hole Peg test ( improvement of 2.142.98 vs. -0.851.29 pegs/minute ; P = 0.005 ) ."
3292,RESULTS,There was no significant difference between training types in the broader assessment batteries of hand function .
3293,RESULTS,"Subjects benefited less from isometric therapy than MusicGlove training , but the difference was not significant ( P > 0.09 ) ."
3294,RESULTS,"Subjects sustained improvements in hand function at a one month follow-up , and found the MusicGlove more motivating than the other two therapies , as measured by the IMI ."
3295,RESULTS,MusicGlove games scores correlated strongly with the B & B score .
3296,CONCLUSIONS,"These results support the hypothesis that hand therapy that is engaging , incorporates high numbers of repetitions of gripping and thumb-finger opposition movements , and promotes afferent input is a promising approach to improving an individual 's ability to manipulate small objects ."
3297,CONCLUSIONS,The MusicGlove provides a simple way to access such therapy .
3298,OBJECTIVE,Current US healthcare delivery systems do not adequately address healthcare demands .
3299,OBJECTIVE,Physicians are integral but rarely emphasize prevention as a primary tool to change health outcomes .

3391,RESULTS,"Intent-to-treat analyses showed no differences between randomized cohorts ; however , 70 % of those randomized to surgery and 52 % of those randomized to nonoperative had undergone surgery by 8 years ."
3392,RESULTS,"As-treated analyses in the randomized group showed that the early benefit for surgery out to 4 years converged over time , with no significant treatment effect of surgery seen in years 6 to 8 for any of the primary outcomes ."
3393,RESULTS,"In contrast , the observational group showed a stable advantage for surgery in all outcomes between years 5 and 8 ."
3394,RESULTS,"Patients who were lost to follow-up were older , less well-educated , sicker , and had worse outcomes during the first 2 years in both surgical and nonoperative arms ."
3395,CONCLUSIONS,"Patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis show diminishing benefits of surgery in as-treated analyses of the randomized group between 4 and 8 years , whereas outcomes in the observational group remained stable ."
3396,CONCLUSIONS,Loss to follow-up of patients with worse early outcomes in both treatment groups could lead to overestimates of long-term outcomes but likely not bias treatment effect estimates .

3406,RESULTS,No changes were detected for orexin A levels .
3407,RESULTS,"Two hours after the intervention , no significant differences were observed in between-group analysis ."
3408,CONCLUSIONS,"The mechanical stimulus provided by spinal manipulation triggers an increase in neurotensin , oxytocin , and cortisol blood levels ."
3409,CONCLUSIONS,Data suggest that the initial capability of the tissues to tolerate mechanical deformation affects the capacity of these tissues to produce an induction of neuropeptide expression .

3429,OBJECTIVE,"Benzodiazepines , other anxiolytics , or sedative hypnotics are prescribed for 30 % -50 % of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) patients ."
3430,OBJECTIVE,"Prior data and theory suggest that these medications may inhibit response to exposure therapy , one of the most effective PTSD treatments ."
3431,OBJECTIVE,The present post hoc study reanalyzed results from a psychotherapy trial to assess whether benzodiazepine use was associated with reduced response to exposure therapy .
3432,METHODS,"Between August 2002 and October 2005 , 283 female veterans and soldiers meeting DSM-IV criteria for PTSD were randomly assigned to 10 weekly 90-minute sessions of either prolonged exposure ( n = 140 ) or present-centered psychotherapy ( n = 143 ) ."
3433,METHODS,Benzodiazepine use ( n = 57 ) or non-use ( n = 226 ) at intake was not randomly assigned .
3434,METHODS,"Multilevel modeling was used to assess the effects of benzodiazepine status , psychotherapy condition , and their interaction on changes on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and the PTSD Checklist during the treatment and 6-month follow-up periods ."
3435,RESULTS,"Consistent with prior reports from these data , prolonged exposure psychotherapy produced greater reductions per week in PTSD symptoms than did present-centered psychotherapy ( b = -0.48 , P = .02 ) ."
3436,RESULTS,"Patients prescribed benzodiazepines did not have weaker response to prolonged exposure , but demonstrated poorer posttreatment maintenance of gains from present-centered psychotherapy ( b = -0.78 , P < .001 ) ."
3437,CONCLUSIONS,Prolonged exposure is a sufficiently robust treatment that patients who are taking benzodiazepines can benefit from it .
3438,CONCLUSIONS,It is unclear whether benzodiazepine use or other patient factors accounted for benzodiazepine recipients ' poorer maintenance of gains in present-centered psychotherapy .

3440,OBJECTIVE,The effects of hypoxic training on exercise performance remain controversial .
3441,OBJECTIVE,"Here , we tested the hypotheses that i ) hypoxic training possesses ergogenic effects at sea level and altitude and ii ) the benefits are primarily mediated by improved mitochondrial function of the skeletal muscle ."
3442,METHODS,"We determined aerobic performance ( incremental test to exhaustion and time trial for a set amount of work ) in moderately trained subjects undergoing 6 wk of endurance training ( 3-4 times per week , 60 min per session ) in normoxia ( placebo , n = 8 ) or normobaric hypoxia ( FIO2 = 0.15 , n = 9 ) using a double-blind and randomized design ."
3443,METHODS,Exercise tests were performed in normoxia and acute hypoxia ( FIO2 = 0.15 ) .

3445,METHODS,Total hemoglobin mass was assessed by carbon monoxide rebreathing .
3446,RESULTS,"Skeletal muscle respiratory capacity was not altered by training or hypoxia ; however , electron coupling control respective to fat oxidation slightly diminished with hypoxic training ."
3447,RESULTS,"Hypoxic training did increase total hemoglobin mass more than the placebo ( 8.4 % vs 3.3 % , P = 0.02 ) ."
3448,RESULTS,"In normoxia , hypoxic training had no additive effect on maximal measures of oxygen uptake or time trial performance ."
3449,RESULTS,"In acute hypoxia , hypoxic training conferred no advantage on maximal oxygen uptake but tended to enhance time trial performance more than normoxic training ( 52 % vs 32 % , P = 0.09 ) ."
3450,CONCLUSIONS,"Our data suggest that , in moderately trained subjects , 6 wk of hypoxic training possesses no ergogenic effect at sea level ."
3451,CONCLUSIONS,"It is not excluded that hypoxic training might facilitate endurance capacity at moderate altitude ; however , this issue is still open and needs to be further examined ."
3452,BACKGROUND,"In this randomized trial , Project CARE , we examined whether participation in a cognitive-behavioral stress management and breast cancer wellness and education program improved psychological outcomes among a sample of underserved black breast cancer survivors ."
3453,METHODS,"Both complementary medicine interventions were 10-sessions , manualized , group-based , and were culturally adapted for black women in the community from evidence-based interventions ."
3454,METHODS,"Participants were 114 black women ( mean age = 51.1 , 27-77 years ) who had completed breast cancer treatment 0-12 months before enrollment ( stages 0-IV , mean time since cancer diagnosis = 14.1 months ) ."
3455,METHODS,"Women were enrolled upon completion of curative treatment ( ie , surgical , chemotherapy , radiation oncology ) and randomized to receive cognitive-behavioral stress management or cancer wellness and education program ."
3456,RESULTS,There was a remarkable 95 % retention rate from baseline to 6-month follow-up .
3457,RESULTS,"Participants in both conditions showed statistically significant improvement on indices of psychological well-being , including overall quality of life ( Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast ) , intrusive thoughts ( Impact of Event Scale-Revised ) , depressive symptoms ( Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression ) , and stress levels ( Perceived Stress Scale ) over the 6-month postintervention follow-up ( all repeated measures analysis of variance within-subjects time effects : P < .05 , except for overall mood ; Profile of Mood States-Short Version ) ."
3458,RESULTS,"Contrary to hypotheses , however , condition time effects were not statistically significant ."
3459,CONCLUSIONS,"Findings suggest that improvements in multiple measures over time may have been due to intensive training in stress management , extensive provision of breast cancer information , or participation in an ongoing supportive group of individuals from a similar racial background ."
3460,CONCLUSIONS,"Implications bear on decisions about appropriate control groups , the timing of intervention delivery during the treatment trajectory , and perceived support from the research team ."

3791,RESULTS,The difference in the visual pain score ( 5.6 vs 3.2 on day 1 ; 3.8 vs 1.5 on day 2 ) and the diclofenac requirements ( 333.3 vs 178.75 mg ) were statistically significant and more in the open pyeloplasty .
3792,RESULTS,The hospital stay and convalescence were significantly lower in retroperitoneoscopic group .
3793,RESULTS,Success rate was found to be 96.67 % with 1 failure in each group .
3794,RESULTS,Two patients in retroperitoneoscopic group required conversion .
3795,RESULTS,Both groups showed significant improvement in pain score and drainage pattern on diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid scan with decrease in hydronephrosis on ultrasound evaluation .
3796,CONCLUSIONS,"Although subjective and objective outcomes are equivalent in both the groups , the retroperitoneoscopic approach is associated with significantly less pain , less analgesic requirement , shorter hospital stay and short convalescence in comparison with open pyeloplasty ."
3797,BACKGROUND,The stimulant prodrug lisdexamfetamine dimesylate ( LDX ) is an effective and generally well tolerated treatment for the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
3798,BACKGROUND,"Positive impacts of LDX on health-related quality of life and functional impairment have previously been demonstrated in a 7-week , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase III study in children and adolescents in Europe ."
3799,BACKGROUND,"Maintenance of these broad benefits , as well as symptomatic control , is a key goal of long-term management of ADHD ."
3800,OBJECTIVE,"Secondary objectives of this multinational study in children and adolescents with ADHD were to assess the long-term maintenance of effectiveness of LDX in improving health-related quality of life and reducing functional impairment , as gauged using the Child Health and Illness Profile-Child Edition : Parent Report Form ( CHIP-CE : PRF ) and the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Parent Report ( WFIRS-P ) , respectively ."
3801,METHODS,Patients aged 6-17 years with diagnosed ADHD and a baseline ADHD Rating Scale IV total score of at least 28 were enrolled from the previous European study and from US sites .
3802,METHODS,"Patients who completed an open-label LDX treatment period of at least 26 weeks were randomized ( 1:1 ) to continue on their optimized dose of LDX or to switch to placebo for a 6-week , double-blind , withdrawal period ."
3803,METHODS,"Parents completed CHIP-CE : PRF and WFIRS-P questionnaires at weeks 0 , 8 and 26 of the open-label period and at weeks 0 and 6 of the randomized-withdrawal period , or at early termination ."
3804,METHODS,The endpoint of each period was defined as the last visit with valid data .
3805,METHODS,Effect sizes were the difference ( LDX minus placebo ) in least-squares ( LS ) - mean change from baseline to endpoint divided by root-mean-square error .
3806,METHODS,P values were nominal and not adjusted for multiple comparisons .
3807,RESULTS,"The open-label and randomized full analysis sets comprised 262 and 153 ( LDX n = 76 ; placebo n = 77 ) patients , respectively ."
3808,RESULTS,"Mean pretreatment CHIP-CE : PRF T-scores were more than one standard deviation below the normative mean in four of the five domains , and there was significant improvement across all domains from baseline to endpoint of the open-label period ."
3809,RESULTS,"In the randomized-withdrawal period , LS-mean CHIP-CE : PRF T-scores deteriorated in all domains in the placebo group , but not in the LDX group ."
3810,RESULTS,"Compared with placebo , the effect of LDX was significant in the Risk Avoidance ( effect size 0.829 ; p < 0.001 ) , Achievement ( 0.696 ; p < 0.001 ) and Satisfaction ( 0.636 ; p < 0.001 ) domains ."
3811,RESULTS,Mean pretreatment WFIRS-P scores were lowest in the Family domain and the Learning and School domain .
3812,RESULTS,WFIRS-P total score and scores in all domains improved significantly from baseline to endpoint of the open-label period .
3813,RESULTS,"In the randomized-withdrawal period , LS-mean scores deteriorated in the placebo group but not in the LDX group ."
3814,RESULTS,"Compared with placebo , the effect of LDX was significant in the Family , Learning and School , and Risky Activities domains and in total ( effect size 0.908 ; p < 0.001 ) ."
3815,CONCLUSIONS,"Using parent-rated instruments , long-term maintenance of the beneficial effect of LDX in multiple domains of health-related quality of life and functional impairment was demonstrated by comparison of treatment continuation and withdrawal under randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled conditions ."
3816,BACKGROUND,The effects of dietary fatty acid supplementation on lipoprotein fatty acid composition have rarely been described .
3817,METHODS,"Sixty-one overweight and obese adults with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance were randomized to placebo , 2g/day extended-release nicotinic acid ( ERN ) , 4g/day prescription omega-3 fatty acid ethyl ester ( P-OM3 ) , or combination therapy for 16 weeks ."
3818,METHODS,Lipoprotein fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography pre - and post-treatment .
3819,RESULTS,"Treatment with P-OM3 or combination , but not ERN , increased proportions of eicosapentaenoic acid , docosahexaenoic acid , and docosapentaenoic acid , and reduced those for arachidonic acid in all lipoprotein fractions , with greatest impact in the high-density lipoprotein fraction ."
3820,RESULTS,P-OM3-induced changes in eicosapentaenoic acid within low-density lipoproteins and very low-density lipoproteins were associated with beneficial effects on mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure .
3821,CONCLUSIONS,"P-OM3 supplementation , with or without ERN , was associated with differentially altered lipoprotein fatty acid composition and improved blood pressure parameters ."
3822,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of oral canagliflozin and its O-glucuronide metabolites ( M7 and M5 ) after single and multiple doses in healthy adult participants .
3823,OBJECTIVE,"The pharmacodynamics , safety , and tolerability of canagliflozin were also evaluated ."
3824,METHODS,"In this open-label , single - ( day 1 ) and multiple-dose ( days 4-9 ) , parallel-group , phase 1 study , 27 healthy participants were randomized into three groups ( 1:1:1 ) to receive 50 , 100 , or 300 mg canagliflozin ."
3825,METHODS,"Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were assessed at pre-pecified timepoints on days 1 , 9 , and 10 ."
3826,RESULTS,"Mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve , and the maximum observed plasma concentration of canagliflozin , M7 , and M5 increased in a dose-dependent manner , across all the 3 doses , following single - and multiple-dose administration ."
3827,RESULTS,"The mean apparent elimination half-lives of canagliflozin , M7 , and M5 were independent of the dose ."
3828,RESULTS,Canagliflozin decreased the renal threshold for glucose ( RTG ) and increased the urinary glucose excretion ( UGE ) in a concentration - and dose-dependent manner .
3829,RESULTS,"The relationship between drug concentrations and RTG was described by a sigmoidal relationship with RTGmin ( minimum value of RTG ) of 37.5 ng/mL ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 34.3 , 40.8 ) and half-maximal effective concentration ( EC50 ) of 21 ng/mL ( 95 % CI : 18.3 , 23.8 ) ."
3830,RESULTS,"No deaths , serious adverse events , hypoglycemic events , or discontinuations due to adverse events were observed ."
3831,CONCLUSIONS,"Pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin and its metabolites ( M7 and M5 ) were linear , and no time-dependent changes were observed after single - and multiple-dose administration ."
3832,CONCLUSIONS,"Similarly , pharmacodynamic effects of canagliflozin on RTG and UGE were found to be dose - and concentration-dependent ."
3833,CONCLUSIONS,"Overall , canagliflozin was well-tolerated in healthy participants ."
3834,BACKGROUND,Neuroendocrine and immune stresses imposed by chronic sleep restriction are known to be involved in the harmful cardiovascular effects associated with poor sleep .
3835,OBJECTIVE,"Despite a well-known beneficial effect of napping on alertness , its effects on neuroendocrine stress and immune responses after sleep restriction are largely unknown ."
3836,METHODS,"This study was a strictly controlled ( sleep-wake status , light environment , caloric intake ) , crossover , randomized design in continuously polysomnography-monitored subjects ."
3837,METHODS,The study was conducted in a laboratory-based study .
3838,METHODS,The subjects were 11 healthy young men .
3839,METHODS,"We investigated the effects on neuroendocrine and immune biomarkers of a night of sleep restricted to 2 h followed by a day without naps or with 30 minute morning and afternoon naps , both conditions followed by an ad libitum recovery night starting at 20:00 ."
3840,METHODS,Salivary interleukin-6 and urinary catecholamines were assessed throughout the daytime study periods .
3841,RESULTS,The increase in norepinephrine values seen at the end of the afternoon after the sleep-restricted night was not present when the subjects had the opportunity to take naps .
3842,RESULTS,Interleukin-6 changes observed after sleep deprivation were also normalized after napping .
3843,RESULTS,"During the recovery day in the no-nap condition , there were increased levels of afternoon epinephrine and dopamine , which was not the case in the nap condition ."
3844,RESULTS,A recovery night after napping was associated with a reduced amount of slow-wave sleep compared to after the no-nap condition .
3845,CONCLUSIONS,Our data suggest that napping has stress-releasing and immune effects .
3846,CONCLUSIONS,Napping could be easily applied in real settings as a countermeasure to the detrimental health consequences of sleep debt .
3847,OBJECTIVE,Prior research has indicated that the loss of skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral density observed with aging is related to the prominent age-related decline in the concentration of serum growth hormone ( GH ) .
3848,OBJECTIVE,"However , there is limited data on the effects of aging on GH responses to acute bouts of heavy resistance exercise ( HRE ) and aerobic exercise ( AE ) ."
3849,METHODS,The present investigation examined the effects of a HRE protocol and an AE protocol on immunoreactive GH ( IGH ) and bioactive GH ( BGH ) in active young and old women .
3850,RESULTS,"Older women had a diminished serum IGH response to both the HRE and AE protocols compared to the younger women , however a similar response was not observed in serum BGH ."
3851,RESULTS,"Additionally , the HRE protocol elicited a greater BGH response than the AE protocol exclusively in the younger group ."
3852,CONCLUSIONS,"Regardless of exercise mode , aging induces an increase in growth hormone polymerization that specifically results in a loss of serum growth hormone immunoreactivity without a concurrent loss of serum growth hormone bioactivity ."
3853,CONCLUSIONS,The greater BGH response to the HRE protocol found in the younger group can be attributed to an unknown serum factor of molecular weight between 30 and 55kD that either potentiated growth hormone bioactivity in response to HRE or inhibited growth hormone bioactivity in response to AE .
3854,OBJECTIVE,"Behavioral measures are often used to distinguish subgroups of patients with stroke ( eg , to predict treatment gains , stratify clinical trial enrollees , or select rehabilitation therapy ) ."
3855,OBJECTIVE,"In studies of the upper extremity , measures of brain function using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) have also been found useful , but this approach has not been examined for the lower extremity ."
3856,OBJECTIVE,The current study hypothesized that an fMRI-based measure of cortical function would significantly improve prediction of treatment-induced lower extremity behavioral gains .
3857,OBJECTIVE,Biomarkers of treatment gains were also explored .
3858,METHODS,"Patients with hemiparesis 1 to 12 months after stroke were enrolled in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial of ropinirole + physical therapy versus placebo + physical therapy , results of which have previously been reported ( NCT00221390 ) ."
3859,METHODS,( 15 ) Primary end point was change in gait velocity .
3860,METHODS,"Enrollees underwent baseline multimodal assessment that included 19 measures spanning 5 assessment categories ( medical history , impairment , disability , brain injury , and brain function ) , and also underwent reassessment 3 weeks after end of therapy ."
3861,RESULTS,"In bivariate analysis , 8 baseline measures belonging to 4 categories ( medical history , impairment , disability , and brain function ) significantly predicted change in gait velocity ."
3862,RESULTS,"Prediction was strongest , however , using a multivariate model containing 2 measures ( leg Fugl-Meyer score and fMRI activation volume within ipsilesional foot sensorimotor cortex ) ."
3863,RESULTS,Increased activation volume within bilateral foot primary sensorimotor cortex correlated positively with treatment-induced leg motor gains .
3864,CONCLUSIONS,A multimodal model incorporating behavioral and fMRI measures best predicted treatment-induced changes in gait velocity in a clinical trial setting .
3865,CONCLUSIONS,Results also suggest potential use of fMRI measures as biomarkers of treatment gains .
3866,OBJECTIVE,To investigate the effect of overnight orthokeratology ( OK ) contact lens wear on axial length growth in East Asian children with progressive myopia .
3867,METHODS,"A prospective , randomized , contralateral-eye crossover study conducted over a 1-year period ."
3868,METHODS,"We enrolled 26 myopic children ( age range , 10.8-17 .0 years ) of East Asian ethnicity ."
3869,METHODS,"Subjects were fitted with overnight OK in 1 eye , chosen at random , and conventional rigid gas-permeable ( GP ) lenses for daytime wear in the contralateral eye ."
3870,METHODS,Lenses were worn for 6 months .
3871,METHODS,"After a 2-week recovery period without lens wear , lens-eye combinations were reversed and lens wear was continued for a further 6 months , followed by another 2-week recovery period without lens wear ."
3872,METHODS,Axial eye length was monitored at baseline and every 3 months using an IOLMaster biometer .
3873,METHODS,Corneal topography ( Medmont E300 ) and objective refraction ( Shin-Nippon NVision-K 5001 autorefractor ) were also measured to confirm that OK lens wear was efficacious in correcting myopia .
3874,METHODS,Axial length elongation and myopia progression with OK were compared with conventional daytime rigid contact lens wear .
3875,RESULTS,"After 6 months of lens wear , axial length had increased by 0.040.06 mm ( meanstandard deviation ) in the GP eye ( P = 0.011 ) but showed no change ( -0.020.05 mm ) in the OK eye ( P = 0.888 ) ."
3876,RESULTS,"During the second 6-month phase of lens wear , in the OK eye there was no change from baseline in axial length at 12 months ( -0.040.08 mm ; P = 0.218 ) ."
3877,RESULTS,"However , in the GP eye , the 12-month increase in axial length was significant ( 0.090.09 mm ; P < 0.001 ) ."
3878,RESULTS,The GP lens-wearing eye showed progressive axial length growth throughout the study .
3879,CONCLUSIONS,"These results provide evidence that , at least in the initial months of lens wear , overnight OK inhibits axial eye growth and myopia progression compared with conventional GP lenses ."
3880,CONCLUSIONS,"Apparent shortening of axial length early in OK lens wear may reflect the contribution of OK-induced central corneal thinning , combined with choroidal thickening or recovery due to a reduction or neutralization of the myopiogenic stimulus to eye growth in these myopic children ."
3881,BACKGROUND,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) is a very disabling condition with a chronic course , if left untreated ."
3882,BACKGROUND,"Though cognitive behavioral treatment ( CBT ) with or without selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI ) is the method of choice , up to one third of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) do not respond to treatment in terms of at least 35 % improvement of symptoms ."
3883,BACKGROUND,Mindfulness based cognitive therapy ( MBCT ) is an 8-week group program that could help OCD patients with no or only partial response to CBT to reduce OC symptoms and develop a helpful attitude towards obsessions and compulsive urges .
3884,METHODS,"This study is a prospective , bicentric , assessor-blinded , randomized , actively-controlled clinical trial ."
3885,METHODS,128 patients with primary diagnosis of OCD according to DSM-IV and no or only partial response to CBT will be recruited from in - and outpatient services as well as online forums and the media .
3886,METHODS,Patients will be randomized to either an MBCT intervention group or to a psycho-educative coaching group ( OCD-EP ) as an active control condition .
3887,METHODS,All participants will undergo eight weekly sessions with a length of 120 minutes each of a structured group program .
3888,METHODS,We hypothesize that MBCT will be superior to OCD-EP in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms as measured by the Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ) following the intervention and at 6 - and 12-months-follow-up .
3889,METHODS,"Secondary outcome measures include depressive symptoms , quality of life , metacognitive beliefs , self-compassion , mindful awareness and approach-avoidance tendencies as measured by an approach avoidance task ."
3890,CONCLUSIONS,The results of this study will elucidate the benefits of MBCT for OCD patients who did not sufficiently benefit from CBT .
3891,CONCLUSIONS,"To our knowledge , this is the first randomized controlled study assessing the effects of MBCT on symptom severity and associated parameters in OCD ."

3894,BACKGROUND,Blond and white hair removal by laser is a complicated task with weak satisfactory results due to the deficiency in laser-absorbing chromophore .
3895,OBJECTIVE,To investigate if repetitive sessions of photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) using external application of liposomal Rose bengal ( RB ) photosensitizer followed by intense pulsed light ( IPL ) exposure enables removal of gray and white hair .
3896,METHODS,"Rose bengal loaded in liposomes ( LRB ) was constructed , prepared in hydrogel , and was studied for some pharmaceutical properties ."
3897,METHODS,Penetration and selective hair follicle damage in mice skin were studied .
3898,METHODS,Topical gel containing LRB was used for treating fifteen adult females who were complaining of facial white terminal hair .
3899,METHODS,Unwanted facial hair was treated for three sessions at intervals of 4-6 weeks using intense pulsed light ( IPL ) .
3900,METHODS,"At each session , the treatment area was pre-treated with topical LRB gel , while a control group of another 15 patients applied placebo gel before IPL treatment ."
3901,METHODS,"Evaluations included hair regrowth , which was measured 4 weeks after each treatment session and at 6 months follow-up by counting the number of terminal hair compared with baseline pretreatment values ."
3902,METHODS,Treatment outcomes and complications if any were also reported .
3903,RESULTS,Average hair regrowth in the LRB group was 56 % after 3 treatment cycles .
3904,RESULTS,"After six-months follow up , average terminal hair count compared with baseline pretreatment showed 40 % reduction and no recorded side effects ."
3905,RESULTS,A significant difference ( P < 0.05 ) was seen compared with the control group ; the clinical results were promising .
3906,CONCLUSIONS,Photodynamic hair removal using rose bengal-encapsulated liposomal gel in combination with IPL treatment showed significant efficacy in the treatment of white hair compared with a control group .
3907,BACKGROUND,Limited data describe patient-reported outcomes ( PROs ) of localised oesophageal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) .
3908,BACKGROUND,The phase 2/3 SCOPE-1 trial assessed the effectiveness of CRTcetuximab .
3909,BACKGROUND,The trial for the first time provided an opportunity to describe PROs from a multi-centre group of patients treated with CRT that are presented here .
3910,METHODS,"Patients undergoing CRTcetuximab within the SCOPE-1 trial ( 258 patients from 36 UK centres ) completed generic - , disease - and treatment-specific health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) questionnaires ( EORTC QLQ-C30 , QLQ-OES18 , Dermatology Life-Quality Index ( DLQI ) ) at baseline and at 7 , 13 , 24 , 52 and 104 weeks ."
3911,METHODS,"Mean EORTC functional scale scores ( > 15 point change significant ) , DLQI scores ( > 4 point change significant ) and proportions of patients ( > 15 % significant ) with ` minimal ' or ` severe ' symptoms are presented ."
3912,RESULTS,Questionnaire response rates were good .
3913,RESULTS,"At baseline , EORTC functional scores were high ( > 75 % ) and few symptoms were reported except for severe problems with fatigue , insomnia and eating-related symptoms ( e.g. , appetite loss , dysphagia , dry mouth ) in both groups ( > 15 % ) ."
3914,RESULTS,"Functional aspects of health deteriorated and symptoms increased with treatment and by week 13 global quality of life , physical , role and social function significantly deteriorated and more problems with fatigue , dyspnoea , appetite loss and trouble with taste were reported ."
3915,RESULTS,Recovery occurred by 6 months ( except severe fatigue and insomnia in > 15 % of patients ) and maintained at follow-up with no differences between groups .
3916,CONCLUSIONS,"CRT for localised oesophageal cancer has a significant detrimental impact on many aspects of HRQL ; however , recovery is achieved by 6 months and maintained with the exception of persisting problems with severe fatigue and insomnia ."
3917,CONCLUSIONS,"The data suggest that the HRQL recovery after definitive CRT is quicker , and there is little lasting deficit compared with treatment including surgery ."
3918,CONCLUSIONS,These data need to be compared with HRQL data from studies evaluating treatments including surgery for oesophageal cancer .
3919,OBJECTIVE,Ischemic heart disease is a leading worldwide cause of death .
3920,OBJECTIVE,The Seattle Post Myocardial Infarction Model ( SPIM ) was developed to predict survival 6 months to 2 years after an acute myocardial infarction with evidence of left ventricular dysfunction .
3921,RESULTS,"A total of 6632 subjects from the EPHESUS trial were used to derive the predictive model , while 5477 subjects from the OPTIMAAL trial were used to validate the model ."
3922,RESULTS,Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to develop a multivariate risk score predictive of all-cause mortality .
3923,RESULTS,"The SPIM risk score integrated lab and vital parameters , Killip class , reperfusion or revascularization , the number of cardiac evidence-based medicines ( aspirin , statin , blocker , ACEI/ARB , aldosterone blocker ) , and the number of cardiac risk factors ."
3924,RESULTS,"The model was predictive of all-cause mortality after myocardial infarction , with an AUC of 0.75 at 6 months and 0.75 at 2 years in the derivation cohort and 0.77 and 0.78 for the same time points in the validation cohort ."
3925,RESULTS,Model predicted versus Kaplan-Meier observed survival was excellent in the derivation cohort .
3926,RESULTS,It remained so in the validation cohort -- 84.9 % versus 85.0 % at 2 years .
3927,RESULTS,The 10 % of subjects with the highest predicted risk had approximately 25 times higher mortality at 2 years than the 10 % of subjects with the lowest predicted risk .
3928,CONCLUSIONS,The SPIM score was a powerful predictor of outcomes after myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction .
3929,CONCLUSIONS,Its highly accurate predictions should improve patient and physician understanding of survival and may prove a useful tool in post-infarct risk stratification .
3930,OBJECTIVE,"To evaluate the effect of finasteride on serum androst-4-ene-3 ,17 - dione ( androstenedione ) and its association with prostate cancer risk among subjects who participated in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial ."
3931,METHODS,"We analyzed serum androstenedione levels in 317 prostate cancer cases and 353 controls , nested in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial , a randomized placebo-controlled trial that found finasteride decreased prostate cancer risk ."
3932,METHODS,Androstenedione is the second most important circulating androgen in men besides testosterone and also a substrate for 5-reductase enzyme .
3933,RESULTS,We observed a 22 % increase in androstenedione levels compared with the baseline values in subjects who were treated with finasteride for 3 years .
3934,RESULTS,This significant increase did not vary by case-control status .
3935,RESULTS,"Adjusted odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval for the third tertile of absolute change in androstenedione levels compared with the first tertile were 0.42 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.19-0 .94 ) for low-grade ( Gleason score < 7 ) cases ."
3936,RESULTS,Similar results were observed when analyzed using percent change .
3937,RESULTS,There were no significant associations between serum androstenedione levels and the risk of high-grade disease .
3938,CONCLUSIONS,"The results of this nested case-control study confirm that finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) and of androstenedione to 5-androstanedione-3 ,17 - dione , which also leads to the reduction of DHT formation ."
3939,CONCLUSIONS,This decrease in DHT may help reduce the risk of low-grade prostate cancer in men .
3940,CONCLUSIONS,Our data on a differential effect of androstenedione also suggest that some high-grade prostate cancers may not require androgen for progression .
3941,OBJECTIVE,Vasopressin and corticosteroids are both commonly used adjunctive therapies in septic shock .
3942,OBJECTIVE,"Retrospective analyses have suggested that there may be an interaction between these drugs , with higher circulating vasopressin levels and improved outcomes in patients treated with both vasopressin and corticosteroids ."
3943,OBJECTIVE,We aimed to test for an interaction between vasopressin and corticosteroids in septic shock .
3944,METHODS,Prospective open-label randomized controlled pilot trial .
3945,METHODS,Four adult ICUs in London teaching hospitals .
3946,METHODS,Sixty-one adult patients who had septic shock .
3947,METHODS,Initial vasopressin IV infusion titrated up to 0.06 U/min and then IV hydrocortisone ( 50 mg 6 hourly ) or placebo .
3948,METHODS,Plasma vasopressin levels were measured at 6-12 and 24-36 hours after hydrocortisone/placebo administration .
3949,RESULTS,Thirty-one patients were allocated to vasopressin + hydrocortisone and 30 patients to vasopressin + placebo .
3950,RESULTS,"The hydrocortisone group required a shorter duration of vasopressin therapy ( 3.1 d ; 95 % CI , 1.1-5 .1 ; shorter in hydrocortisone group ) and required a lower total dose of vasopressin ( ratio , 0.47 ; 95 % CI , 0.32-0 .71 ) compared with the placebo group ."
3951,RESULTS,"Plasma vasopressin levels were not higher in the hydrocortisone group compared with the placebo group ( 64 pmol/L difference at 6 - to 12-hour time point ; 95 % CI , -32 to 160 pmol/L ) ."
3952,RESULTS,Early vasopressin use was well tolerated with only one serious adverse event possibly related to study drug administration reported .
3953,RESULTS,There were no differences in mortality rates ( 23 % 28-day mortality in both groups ) or organ failure assessments between the two treatment groups .
3954,CONCLUSIONS,"Hydrocortisone spared vasopressin requirements , reduced duration , and reduced dose , when used together in the treatment of septic shock , but it did not alter plasma vasopressin levels ."
3955,CONCLUSIONS,Further trials are needed to assess the clinical effectiveness of vasopressin as the initial vasopressor therapy with or without corticosteroids .
3956,BACKGROUND,Current holistic rehabilitation blends both physical and psychological techniques .
3957,BACKGROUND,"However , validation of the usefulness of psychological strategies is limited in the literature ."
3958,OBJECTIVE,To quantify the effects of psychological strategies on both physiologic ( salivary cortisol ) and subjective assessments of stress .
3959,METHODS,Randomized controlled clinical trial .
3960,METHODS,Laboratory .
3961,METHODS,"A total of 97 college-aged students ( age = 20.65 4.38 years ) , most with little to no experience with psychological strategies ."

3963,METHODS,The control group listened to 15 minutes of ambient nature sounds .
3964,METHODS,"Two samples ( pretest , posttest ) of salivary cortisol were analyzed using an enzyme immunoassay kit ; the average was used for statistical analysis ."
3965,METHODS,"Descriptive statistics and correlations were conducted to examine group differences in time of day , salivary cortisol , sex , Stress-O-Meter values , and Perceived Stress Scale scores ."
3966,RESULTS,"Salivary cortisol levels were lower in the treatment group than the control group ( F2 ,97 = 15.62 , P < .001 ) ."
3967,RESULTS,"Females had higher scores on both the pretest Stress-O-Meter ( 5.15 1.796 ) and the Perceived Stress Scale ( 18.31 5.833 ) than males ( 4.25 1.741 and 15.272 5.390 , respectively ) ."
3968,CONCLUSIONS,Both cognitive and somatic relaxation strategies reduced cortisol levels .
3969,CONCLUSIONS,Participants who received verbal guidance achieved a larger cortisol reduction .
3970,CONCLUSIONS,"However , the change in cortisol level was uncorrelated with the change in report of acute stress ; females reported higher levels of stress ."
3971,CONCLUSIONS,Clinical implications include attention to sex when assessing stress and providing coping skills during the rehabilitation process .
3972,OBJECTIVE,To explore the efficiency of single application of lobaplatin in tran-scatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) for patients with a primary hepatic carcinoma who were unable or unwilling to undergo surgery .
3973,METHODS,173 patients with primary hepatic carcinoma diagnosed by imaging or pathology were randomly divided into experimental and control groups and respectively treated with lobaplatin and pirarubicin hydrochloride as chemotherapeutic drugs for TACE .

4046,BACKGROUND,Impulsive decision making is a hallmark of frequently occurring addiction disorders including alcohol dependence ( AD ) .
4047,BACKGROUND,"Therefore , ameliorating impulsive decision making is a promising target for the treatment of AD ."
4048,BACKGROUND,Previous studies have shown that modafinil enhances cognitive control functions in various psychiatric disorders .
4049,BACKGROUND,"However , the effects of modafinil on delay discounting and its underlying neural correlates have not been investigated as yet ."
4050,BACKGROUND,The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of modafinil on neural correlates of impulsive decision making in abstinent AD patients and healthy control ( HC ) subjects .
4051,METHODS,"A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , within-subjects cross-over study using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) was conducted in 14 AD patients and 16 HC subjects ."
4052,METHODS,All subjects participated in two fMRI sessions in which they either received a single dose of placebo or 200mg of modafinil 2h before the session .
4053,METHODS,"During fMRI , subjects completed a delay-discounting task to measure impulsive decision making ."
4054,RESULTS,"Modafinil improved impulsive decision making in AD pateints , which was accompanied by enhanced recruitment of frontoparietal regions and reduced activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ."
4055,RESULTS,"Moreover , modafinil-induced enhancement of functional connectivity between the superior frontal gyrus and ventral striatum was specifically associated with improvement in impulsive decision making ."
4056,CONCLUSIONS,These findings indicate that modafinil can improve impulsive decision making in AD patients through an enhanced coupling of prefrontal control regions and brain regions coding the subjective value of rewards .

4068,BACKGROUND,Fish oil supplementation has been shown to alter gene expression of mononuclear cells both in vitro and in vivo .
4069,BACKGROUND,"However , little is known about the total transcriptome profile in healthy subjects after intake of fish oil ."
4070,BACKGROUND,We therefore investigated the gene expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) after intake of fish oil for 7 weeks using transcriptome analyses .
4071,METHODS,"In a 7-week , double-blinded , randomized , controlled , parallel-group study , healthy subjects received 8 g day ( -1 ) fish oil ( 1.6 g day ( -1 ) eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid ) ( n = 17 ) or 8 g day ( -1 ) high oleic sunflower oil ( n = 19 ) ."
4072,METHODS,Microarray analyses of RNA isolated from PBMCs were performed at baseline and after 7 weeks of intervention .
4073,RESULTS,"Cell cycle , DNA packaging and chromosome organization are biological processes found to be upregulated after intake of fish oil compared to high oleic sunflower oil using a moderated t-test ."
4074,RESULTS,"In addition , gene set enrichment analysis identified several enriched gene sets after intake of fish oil ."
4075,RESULTS,"The genes contributing to the significantly different gene sets in the subjects given fish oil compared with the control group are involved in cell cycle , endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress and apoptosis ."
4076,RESULTS,"Gene transcripts with common motifs for 35 known transcription factors including E2F , TP53 and ATF4 were upregulated after intake of fish oil ."
4077,CONCLUSIONS,We have shown that intake of fish oil for 7 weeks modulates gene expression in PBMCs of healthy subjects .
4078,CONCLUSIONS,"The increased expression of genes related to cell cycle , ER stress and apoptosis suggests that intake of fish oil may modulate basic cellular processes involved in normal cellular function ."
4079,OBJECTIVE,"Despite increasing trends toward the early initiation of oral feeding after gastrointestinal ( GI ) surgeries , current evidence has not been convincing ."
4080,OBJECTIVE,The present randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of early oral feeding ( EOF ) with late oral feeding ( LOF ) following surgery for upper GI tumors .
4081,METHODS,"One hundred and nine consecutive patients with esophageal or gastric tumors undergoing surgical resection in two hospitals in Tehran , Iran , were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled trial , and were randomly assigned to a group starting EOF on the first postoperative day and another group that remained nil by mouth until the return of bowel sounds ( LOF group ) ."
4082,METHODS,The clinical and surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups .
4083,RESULTS,The clinical outcomes were significantly better in the patients in the EOF group ( p < 0.05 ) .
4084,RESULTS,Repeated nil per os ( 14.8 vs. 30.9 % ) and re-hospitalization ( 1.8 vs. 7.3 % ) were more common in LOF group ( p < 0.0001 ) .
4085,RESULTS,"Additionally , gas passage , nasogastric tube ( NGT ) discharge , a decrease in intravenous serum to less than 1000 ml per day , the time to start a soft diet and hospital discharge following surgery occurred significantly earlier in the EOF group than in the LOF group ( p < 0.0001 ) ."
4086,CONCLUSIONS,"Early oral feeding after the surgical resection of esophageal and gastric tumors is safe , and is associated with favorable early in-hospital outcomes and a sooner return to physiological GI function and hospital discharge ."
4087,OBJECTIVE,To examine whether socioeconomic position ( SEP ) was associated with change in cardiovascular risk factors and meeting treatment targets for cardiovascular risk factors among individuals with screen-detected Type 2 DM at six-year follow-up .
4088,METHODS,The study population was 1533 people with Type 2 DM identified from at stepwise diabetes screening programme in general practice during 2001-2006 in the ADDITION-Denmark study .

4119,METHODS,Patients were assigned to two groups .
4120,METHODS,"In Group I , the IOL was traditionally implanted after all nuclear fragments were completely removed , and in Group II , the IOL was innovatively implanted in the bag before the last residual nuclear fragment was removed ."
4121,METHODS,"This novel adjusted surgical procedure , named the `` IOL-shell technique '' , features use of the IOL as a protective barrier rather than simply as a refractive alternative , and it is conceptually different from the traditional step-by-step procedure ."
4122,METHODS,"Clinical examinations , including uncorrected visual acuity , central corneal thickness ( CCT ) , temporal clear corneal incision thickness and corneal endothelial cell density , were carried out ."
4123,RESULTS,The inter-group difference in temporal corneal thickness was found to be of no statistical significance at any of the visits .

4161,RESULTS,Repeat transfusion varied from 2 % in Kenya/Tanzania to 6 to 13 % at the four Ugandan centres .
4162,RESULTS,Adverse reactions to blood were rare ( 0.4 % ) .
4163,CONCLUSIONS,"Severe anaemia complicates one third of childhood admissions with serious febrile illness to hospitals in East Africa , and is associated with increased mortality ."
4164,CONCLUSIONS,"A high proportion of deaths occurred within 2.5 hours of admission , emphasizing the need for rapid recognition and prompt blood transfusion ."
4165,CONCLUSIONS,Adherence to current WHO transfusion guidelines was poor .
4166,CONCLUSIONS,The high rates of re-transfusion suggest that 20 mL/kg whole blood or 10 mL/kg packed cells may undertreat a significant proportion of anaemic children .
4167,CONCLUSIONS,Future evaluation of the impact of a larger volume of transfused blood and optimum transfusion management of children with Hb of < 6 g/dL is warranted .
4168,OBJECTIVE,"To assess long-term superiority in terms of chronic pain between prolene hernia system ( PHS ) , mesh plug repair ( MPR ) and Lichtenstein ( L ) technique for inguinal hernia repair ."
4169,METHODS,"Eight years after randomizing three commonly used techniques for primary inguinal hernia repair , the outcome was evaluated with a questionnaire measuring pain on verbal descriptor and visual analogue scales , including limitations on daily life activities , sensory disturbances and recurrences ."
4170,METHODS,"From previous results patients characteristics , operative details and short - and mid-term pain outcome were extracted ."
4171,RESULTS,270 out of 308 eligible patients ( 88 % ) completed the follow-up after median 7.6 years ( range 6.9-9 .2 ) after the inguinal hernia operation .
4172,RESULTS,"No significant differences between the repair techniques were found for pain , sensory disturbances or recurrences ."
4173,RESULTS,"Overall , the hernia recurrence rate was 6.3 % ."
4174,RESULTS,In total 63 patients ( 23 % ) reported long-term pain of which one-fourth graded this moderate to severe .
4175,RESULTS,Pain was experienced at least weekly by 26 patients ( 10 % ) and limiting daily activities for 36 patients ( 13 % ) .

4180,CONCLUSIONS,"Long-term outcome after randomizing PHS , MPR and L showed no clinically relevant differences in chronic pain and its consequences ."
4181,CONCLUSIONS,Although chronic pain is diminishing over time it remains a serious complication and has sometimes an onset long after the inguinal repair .
4182,BACKGROUND,Previous work has demonstrated paradoxical increases in cerebral oxygen saturation ( ScO2 ) as blood pressure decreases and paradoxical decreases in ScO2 as blood pressure increases .
4183,BACKGROUND,It has been suggested that these paradoxical responses indicate a functional cerebral autoregulation mechanism .
4184,BACKGROUND,"Accordingly , the authors hypothesized that if this suggestion is correct , paradoxical responses will occur exclusively in patients with intact cerebral autoregulation ."
4185,METHODS,Thirty-four patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were included .
4186,METHODS,"Cerebral autoregulation was assessed with the near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral oximetry index ( COx ) , computed by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient between mean arterial pressure and ScO2 ."
4187,METHODS,COx less than 0.30 was previously defined as functional autoregulation .
4188,METHODS,"During cardiopulmonary bypass , 20 % change in blood pressure was accomplished with the use of nitroprusside for decreasing pressure and phenylephrine for increasing pressure ."
4189,METHODS,Effects on COx were assessed .
4190,METHODS,"Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA , Kruskal-Wallis test , and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U test ."
4191,RESULTS,"Sixty-five percent of patients had a baseline COx less than 0.30 , indicating functional baseline autoregulation ."
4192,RESULTS,"In 50 % of these patients ( n = 10 ) , COx became highly negative after vasoactive drug administration ( from -0.04 [ -0.25 to 0.16 ] to -0.63 [ -0.83 to -0.26 ] after administration of phenylephrine , and from -0.05 [ -0.19 to 0.17 ] to -0.55 [ -0.94 to -0.35 ] after administration of nitroprusside ) ."
4193,RESULTS,"A negative COx implies a decrease in ScO2 with increase in pressure and , conversely , an increase in ScO2 with decrease in pressure ."
4194,CONCLUSIONS,"In this study , paradoxical changes in ScO2 after pharmacological-induced pressure changes occurred exclusively in patients with intact cerebral autoregulation , corroborating the hypothesis that these paradoxical responses might be attributable to a functional cerebral autoregulation ."

4217,METHODS,The untreated scar half served as a control .
4218,METHODS,Scars were re-evaluated 12 weeks later .
4219,METHODS,An independent blinded observer graded the scar halves with the Vancouver scar scale ( VSS ) immediately prior to treatment and 12 weeks after treatment .
4220,METHODS,Subjects completed a visual analog scale ( VAS ) at the same time points .
4221,RESULTS,"Three months after laser treatment , a significant decrease in VSS and 3 of the 4 of its individual parameters were detected in both control and treated halves of the scar ."
4222,RESULTS,"When comparing the laser group versus the control group , a statistically significant difference was not noted in VSS ( P = 0.31 ) but a statistically significant difference in patient VAS was detected ( P = 0.002 ) ."
4223,RESULTS,No side effects of the laser treatment were noted .
4224,CONCLUSIONS,Facial wounds sutured in a layered manner heal well .
4225,CONCLUSIONS,"Patients prefer early fractional CO2 lasing of surgical scars , though use of the VSS failed to detect an objective difference between laser and control halves of scars ."
4226,CONCLUSIONS,"Conservative laser settings , a single session treatment , and VSS insensitivity for surgical scars may influence these findings ."

4286,BACKGROUND,"In patients with metastatic breast cancer that is positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) , progression-free survival was significantly improved after first-line therapy with pertuzumab , trastuzumab , and docetaxel , as compared with placebo , trastuzumab , and docetaxel ."
4287,BACKGROUND,Overall survival was significantly improved with pertuzumab in an interim analysis without the median being reached .
4288,BACKGROUND,We report final prespecified overall survival results with a median follow-up of 50 months .
4289,METHODS,We randomly assigned patients with metastatic breast cancer who had not received previous chemotherapy or anti-HER2 therapy for their metastatic disease to receive the pertuzumab combination or the placebo combination .
4290,METHODS,"The secondary end points of overall survival , investigator-assessed progression-free survival , independently assessed duration of response , and safety are reported ."
4291,METHODS,Sensitivity analyses were adjusted for patients who crossed over from placebo to pertuzumab after the interim analysis .
4292,RESULTS,"The median overall survival was 56.5 months ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 49.3 to not reached ) in the group receiving the pertuzumab combination , as compared with 40.8 months ( 95 % CI , 35.8 to 48.3 ) in the group receiving the placebo combination ( hazard ratio favoring the pertuzumab group , 0.68 ; 95 % CI , 0.56 to 0.84 ; P < 0.001 ) , a difference of 15.7 months ."
4293,RESULTS,This analysis was not adjusted for crossover to the pertuzumab group and is therefore conservative .

4300,BACKGROUND,Sugar overconsumption and chronic stress are growing health concerns because they both may increase the risk for obesity and its related diseases .
4301,BACKGROUND,"Rodent studies suggest that sugar consumption may activate a glucocorticoid-metabolic-brain-negative feedback pathway , which may turn off the stress response and thereby reinforce habitual sugar overconsumption ."
4302,OBJECTIVE,The objective of the study was to test our hypothesized glucocorticoid-metabolic-brain model in women consuming beverages sweetened with either aspartame of sucrose .
4303,METHODS,"This was a parallel-arm , double-masked diet intervention study ."
4304,METHODS,"The study was conducted at the University of California , Davis , Clinical and Translational Science Center 's Clinical Research Center and the University of California , Davis , Medical Center Imaging Research Center ."
4305,METHODS,Nineteen women ( age range 18-40 y ) with a body mass index ( range 20-34 kg/m ( 2 ) ) who were a subgroup from a National Institutes of Health-funded investigation of 188 participants assigned to eight experimental groups .
4306,METHODS,The intervention consisted of sucrose - or aspartame-sweetened beverage consumption three times per day for 2 weeks .
4307,METHODS,Salivary cortisol and regional brain responses to the Montreal Imaging Stress Task were measured .
4308,RESULTS,"Compared with aspartame , sucrose consumption was associated with significantly higher activity in the left hippocampus ( P = .001 ) ."
4309,RESULTS,"Sucrose , but not aspartame , consumption associated with reduced ( P = .024 ) stress-induced cortisol ."
4310,RESULTS,"The sucrose group also had a lower reactivity to naltrexone , significantly ( P = .041 ) lower nausea , and a trend ( P = .080 ) toward lower cortisol ."
4311,CONCLUSIONS,These experimental findings support a metabolic-brain-negative feedback pathway that is affected by sugar and may make some people under stress more hooked on sugar and possibly more vulnerable to obesity and its related conditions .
4312,OBJECTIVE,To compare the clinical outcomes of wavefront-guided and wavefront-optimized laser in situ keratomileusis ( LASIK ) .
4313,METHODS,"Prospective , randomized , fellow-eye-controlled study ."
4314,METHODS,The setting was a single academic institution .
4315,METHODS,The study population included 110 eyes of 55 patients with myopia with and without astigmatism .
4316,METHODS,One eye of each patient was randomized to undergo wavefront-guided LASIK by the AMO Visx CustomVue S4 IR excimer laser system ; the fellow eye received wavefront-optimized LASIK by the Alcon Allegretto Wave Eye-Q 400 Hz excimer laser system .

4321,RESULTS,Average spherical equivalent refractions were -0.13 0.46 diopters in wavefront-guided eyes whereas in wavefront-optimized eyes the refractions were -0.41 0.38 diopters at 12 months .
4322,RESULTS,"Wavefront-guided eyes also achieved better best-corrected visual acuity at both the 5 % and 25 % contrast levels ( P = 0.022 and P = 0.004 , respectively ) ."
4323,RESULTS,There were no differences in levels of residual astigmatism ( P = 0.798 ) or in higher order aberrations ( P = 0.869 ) .
4324,CONCLUSIONS,Both wavefront-guided and wavefront-optimized treatments are able to correct myopia safely and effectively in eyes with and without astigmatism .
4325,CONCLUSIONS,"However , wavefront-guided treatment platforms appear to offer significant advantages in terms of residual refractive error , uncorrected distance acuity and contrast sensitivity ."
4326,BACKGROUND,Impairments in mismatch negativity ( MMN ) generation have been consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia .
4327,BACKGROUND,"However , underlying oscillatory activity of MMN deficits in schizophrenia and the relationship with cognitive impairments have not been investigated in detail ."
4328,BACKGROUND,Time-frequency power and phase analyses can provide more detailed measures of brain dynamics of MMN deficits in schizophrenia .
4329,METHODS,21 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy controls were tested with a roving frequency paradigm to generate MMN .
4330,METHODS,Time-frequency domain power and phase-locking ( PL ) analysis was performed on all trials using short-time Fourier transforms with Hanning window tapering .
4331,METHODS,A comprehensive battery ( CANTAB ) was used to assess neurocognitive functioning .
4332,RESULTS,Mean MMN amplitude was significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia ( 95 % CI 0.18 - 0.77 ) .
4333,RESULTS,Patients showed significantly lower EEG power ( 95 % CI -1.02 - -0.014 ) in the ~ 4-7 Hz frequency range ( theta band ) between 170 and 210 ms. Patients with schizophrenia showed cognitive impairment in multiple domains of CANTAB .
4334,RESULTS,"However , MMN impairments in amplitude and power were not correlated with clinical measures , medication dose , social functioning or neurocognitive performance ."
4335,CONCLUSIONS,"The findings from this study suggested that while MMN may be a useful marker to probe NMDA receptor mediated mechanisms and associated impairments in gain control and perceptual changes , it may not be a useful marker in association with clinical or cognitive changes ."
4336,CONCLUSIONS,Trial-by-trial EEG power analysis can be used as a measure of brain dynamics underlying MMN deficits which also can have implications for the use of MMN as a biomarker for drug discovery .
4337,BACKGROUND,"Despite the availability of new antibiotics such as daptomycin , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) bacteraemia continues to be associated with high clinical failure rates ."
4338,BACKGROUND,Combination therapy has been proposed as an alternative to improve outcomes but there is a lack of clinical studies .
4339,BACKGROUND,The study aims to demonstrate that combination of daptomycin plus fosfomycin achieves higher clinical success rates in the treatment of MRSA bacteraemia than daptomycin alone .
4340,METHODS,"A multicentre open-label , randomised phase III study ."
4341,METHODS,Adult patients hospitalised with MRSA bacteraemia will be randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) to group 1 : daptomycin 10mg/kg/24h intravenous ; or group 2 : daptomycin 10mg/kg/24h intravenous plus fosfomycin 2gr/6g intravenous .
4342,METHODS,The main outcome will be treatment response at week 6 after stopping therapy ( test-of-cure ( TOC ) visit ) .
4343,METHODS,This is a composite variable with two values : Treatment success : resolution of clinical signs and symptoms ( clinical success ) and negative blood cultures ( microbiological success ) at the TOC visit .
4344,METHODS,Treatment failure : if any of the following conditions apply : ( 1 ) lack of clinical improvement at 72h or more after starting therapy ; ( 2 ) persistent bacteraemia ( positive blood cultures on day 7 ) ; ( 3 ) therapy is discontinued early due to adverse effects or for some other reason based on clinical judgement ; ( 4 ) relapse of MRSA bacteraemia before the TOC visit ; ( 5 ) death for any reason before the TOC visit .
4345,METHODS,"Assuming a 60 % cure rate with daptomycin and a 20 % difference in cure rates between the two groups , 103 patients will be needed for each group ( :0.05 , : 0.2 ) ."

4358,RESULTS,No significant difference in the frequency of GO exacerbation was seen between the groups ( PCS-On group : n = 18 [ 12.1 % ] ; PCS-Off group : n = 11 [ 7.5 % ] ; P = .17 ) .
4359,RESULTS,"Significant prognostic factors were identified as thyroid-stimulating antibody ( by 100 % linear increase : risk ratio , 1.15 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.07-1 .24 ; P = .0003 ) and clinical activity score ( 1 vs 0 : risk ratio , 6.40 ; 95 % confidence interval , 2.17-19 .7 ; P = .0009 ) ."
4360,CONCLUSIONS,Exacerbation of GO after RAI therapy in the Japanese population appears less common than in other populations .
4361,CONCLUSIONS,Low-dose PCS did not produce a significant preventive effect and appeared insufficient .
4362,CONCLUSIONS,Patients presenting with risk factors would thus be recommended to receive higher-dose PCS .
4363,BACKGROUND,"Motives for use have been identified as important predictors of substance use and related problems ; however , little is known about how motives for use change following an intervention and how this change may impact future substance use behaviors ."
4364,BACKGROUND,The present study sought to describe change in motives following an intervention for marijuana-dependent adults .
4365,BACKGROUND,"Furthermore , investigators examined change in motives as a predictor of treatment outcome ."
4366,METHODS,The study randomized 74 adults to one of two conditions : both of which received 9-sessions base treatment of cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement therapy and had access to additional sessions of cognitive behavioral treatment on an as-needed basis .
4367,METHODS,The experimental condition received two additional `` check-ups '' during the course of follow-up .
4368,RESULTS,Significant decreases in reported frequency of motives used were observed following treatment .
4369,RESULTS,Changes in Expansion and Coping were associated with differential treatment outcomes .
4370,RESULTS,"Decreases in Expansion were associated with poorer treatment outcome , while decreases in Coping were associated with better treatment outcome ."
4371,CONCLUSIONS,The relationship between expansion motives and outcomes was paradoxical .
4372,CONCLUSIONS,"Although there were some inconsistencies in the findings , the results regarding the coping motive were consistent with hypotheses and may have important implications for treatment ."
4373,BACKGROUND,The bile acid derivative 6-ethylchenodeoxycholic acid ( obeticholic acid ) is a potent activator of the farnesoid X nuclear receptor that reduces liver fat and fibrosis in animal models of fatty liver disease .
4374,BACKGROUND,We assessed the efficacy of obeticholic acid in adult patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis .
4375,METHODS,"We did a multicentre , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , randomised clinical trial at medical centres in the USA in patients with non-cirrhotic , non-alcoholic steatohepatitis to assess treatment with obeticholic acid given orally ( 25 mg daily ) or placebo for 72 weeks ."
4376,METHODS,"Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using a computer-generated , centrally administered procedure , stratified by clinical centre and diabetes status ."
4377,METHODS,The primary outcome measure was improvement in centrally scored liver histology defined as a decrease in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score by at least 2 points without worsening of fibrosis from baseline to the end of treatment .
4378,METHODS,"A planned interim analysis of change in alanine aminotransferase at 24 weeks undertaken before end-of-treatment ( 72 weeks ) biopsies supported the decision to continue the trial ( relative change in alanine aminotransferase -24 % , 95 % CI -45 to -3 ) ."
4379,METHODS,"A planned interim analysis of the primary outcome showed improved efficacy of obeticholic acid ( p = 00024 ) and supported a decision not to do end-of-treatment biopsies and end treatment early in 64 patients , but to continue the trial to obtain the 24-week post-treatment measures ."
4380,METHODS,Analyses were done by intention-to-treat .
4381,METHODS,"This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01265498 ."
4382,RESULTS,"Between March 16 , 2011 , and Dec 3 , 2012 , 141 patients were randomly assigned to receive obeticholic acid and 142 to placebo ."
4383,RESULTS,"50 ( 45 % ) of 110 patients in the obeticholic acid group who were meant to have biopsies at baseline and 72 weeks had improved liver histology compared with 23 ( 21 % ) of 109 such patients in the placebo group ( relative risk 19 , 95 % CI 13 to 28 ; p = 00002 ) ."
4384,RESULTS,33 ( 23 % ) of 141 patients in the obeticholic acid developed pruritus compared with nine ( 6 % ) of 142 in the placebo group .
4385,CONCLUSIONS,"Obeticholic acid improved the histological features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis , but its long-term benefits and safety need further clarification ."

4387,BACKGROUND,Strategies are needed to help general practitioners ( GPs ) promote smoking cessation as recommended by guidelines .
4388,BACKGROUND,This study examines whether the quality of action planning among GPs improves their provision of smoking cessation care .
4389,METHODS,The effectiveness of a 1-h training programme was examined in a cluster randomised controlled trial in which 49 GPs participated .
4390,METHODS,"GPs who followed the training ( intervention group ; n = 25 ) formulated action plans related to i ) enquiring about smoking , ii ) advising to quit smoking , and iii ) arranging follow-up for smokers motivated to quit ."
4391,METHODS,GPs also formulated a coping plan for encountering smokers not motivated to quit .
4392,METHODS,"The quality of these plans ( plan specificity ) was rated and , 6 weeks after the training , GPs reported on the performance of these plans ( plan enactment ) ."
4393,METHODS,"Multilevel regression analyses were used to examine the effects of plan specificity and plan enactment on patient-reported smoking cessation activities of the GPs in the intervention group ( n = 1,632 patients ) compared with the control group ( n = 1,769 patients ) ."
4394,RESULTS,"Compared to the control group , GPs who formulated a highly specific action plan during the training asked their patients about smoking more often after the training compared to prior to the training ( OR 2.11 , 95 % CI 1.51-2 .95 ) ."
4395,RESULTS,"GPs were most likely to have asked patients about smoking after the training compared to prior to the training when they had enacted a highly specific formulated action plan ( OR 3.08 , 95 % CI 2.04-4 .64 ) ."
4396,RESULTS,"The effects of GP plan specificity and plan enactment on asking patient about smoking were most prominent among GPs who , at baseline , intended to provide smoking cessation care ."
4397,CONCLUSIONS,"A highly specific action plan formulated by a GP on when , how , and by whom patients will be asked about smoking had a positive effect on GPs ' asking patients about smoking , especially when these professionals also reported to have enacted this plan ."
4398,CONCLUSIONS,This effect was most prominent among GPs who intended to provide smoking cessation care prior to the intervention .
4399,CONCLUSIONS,Training in devising personalised coping plans is recommended to further increase GPs ' provision of advice to quit smoking and arranging follow-up support to quit smoking .
4400,OBJECTIVE,"The preferred approach to the management of common bile duct ( CBD ) stones is uncertain , with single-stage laparoscopic cholecystectomy and CBD exploration vs. two-stage preoperative endoscopic CBD clearance followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy being debated ."
4401,OBJECTIVE,"To address this , a prospective randomized study which compared these two management strategies was undertaken ."
4402,METHODS,"Between Jan 2002 and Dec 2005 , patients with gallstones and common bile duct stones diagnosed by preoperative ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were randomized to single-stage vs. two-stage treatment ."
4403,METHODS,"In a single-stage group , laparoscopic cholecystectomy and CBD exploration were undertaken at the same operation , whereas in a two-stage group , endoscopic stone clearance was followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy 2-5 days later ."
4404,METHODS,Early treatment success and complications and longer-term follow-up for the two groups were compared .
4405,RESULTS,"Two hundred twenty-one patients were enrolled in the trial , 110 in the single-stage group and 111 in the two-stage group ."
4406,RESULTS,"There was no significant difference in the success rate of CBD clearance ( 93.6 vs. 94.6 % , p = 0.76 ) or the complication rates ( 3.6 vs. 5.1 % , p = 0.527 ) between the groups ."
4407,RESULTS,"However , at longer-term follow-up , recurrent CBD stones were seen more often in the two-stage group ( 9.5 vs. 2.1 % , p = 0.037 ) ."
4408,CONCLUSIONS,The single-stage and two-stage approaches were equally effective in achieving initial clearance of CBD stones .
4409,CONCLUSIONS,"However , recurrent CBD stones occurred more commonly in patients who had undergone two-stage treatment with initial endoscopic stone clearance , followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy ."
4410,BACKGROUND,"Amino-acid ( AA ) metabolic signatures differ in insulin-resistant ( IR ) obese vs normal-weight subjects , improve after weight loss , and seem to predict the risk of type 2 diabetes ."
4411,BACKGROUND,It is unknown whether weight-maintaining dietary measures aimed at influencing IR alter AA signatures of high-risk subjects .
4412,METHODS,"In the randomized controlled Protein , Fiber and Metabolic Syndrome ( ProFiMet ) trial we investigated effects of four isoenergetic , moderately fat-reduced diets varying in protein and cereal-fiber contents on complete AA metabolic signatures in 76 group-matched overweight or obese high-risk subjects ."
4413,METHODS,"We analyzed the relation of whole-body and hepatic IR with AA signatures , body fat composition and liver fat , after 0 , 6 , and 18 weeks of dietary intervention ."
4414,METHODS,Discrimination between diets was further enhanced by providing tailored dietary supplements for twice-daily consumption over 18 weeks in all groups .
4415,RESULTS,"Baseline AA , including branched-chain signatures significantly related to IR , liver fat , and visceral fat mass ."
4416,RESULTS,"Isoenergetic variation of protein and cereal-fiber dietary contents , but not fat restriction , significantly influenced IR , whereas the relation of AA with IR changed with all diets ."
4417,RESULTS,"The tryptophan ratio was significantly suppressed in obese vs overweight participants , but increased after 6 weeks of high cereal-fiber intake to a nonobese phenotype ."
4418,RESULTS,Modeling analyses revealed diet-induced alterations of complex AA profiles to relate to 70 % and 62 % of changes in whole-body and hepatic IR .
4419,CONCLUSIONS,"We demonstrate that relatively short-term isoenergetic changes in the diet significantly alter the relation of AA signatures with IR , with possible implications on the determination and treatment of diabetes risk ."
4420,BACKGROUND,"Recently , men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer ( PC ) were classified into favorable and unfavorable categories ; however , whether the risk of PC-specific mortality ( PCSM ) among men with high-risk PC versus unfavorable intermediate-risk PC is increased is unknown ."
4421,METHODS,"In a prospective , randomized trial conducted between 1995 and 2001 , 206 men with intermediate-risk or high-risk PC were randomized to receive 70 Gy with or without 6 months of androgen-suppression therapy ( AST ) ."
4422,METHODS,The subgroup of 197 patients with information available on the percentage of positive biopsies formed the cohort .
4423,METHODS,Fine and Gray regression analysis was used to assess whether men with high-risk PC versus unfavorable intermediate-risk PC had an increased risk of PCSM .
4424,RESULTS,"After a median follow-up of 14.3 years , there were 127 deaths ( 64.5 % ) , including 22 deaths ( 17.3 % ) from PC ."
4425,RESULTS,There were no PC deaths in the favorable intermediate-risk group .
4426,RESULTS,"There was an increase in the risk of PCSM among men with high-risk PC versus unfavorable intermediate-risk PC , but the difference was not significant ( adjusted hazard ratio , 1.59 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.66-3 .83 ; P = .30 ) after adjusting for age , randomized treatment arm , and comorbidity ."
4427,CONCLUSIONS,"The lack of PC deaths among men with favorable intermediate-risk PC suggests that adding AST may not reduce their risk of PCSM ; whereas many men with unfavorable intermediate-risk PC are at risk for harboring occult PC with Gleason scores from 8 to 10 and , if proven , would benefit from long-term AST ."
4428,CONCLUSIONS,Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions should be considered to identify PC with Gleason scores from 8 to 10 in these men .
4429,OBJECTIVE,"The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the activity of agmatine , an inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) inhibitor and selective N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) antagonist , on reducing tissue damage in distal part of traumatic nerve in an experimental rat peripheral nerve injury model ."
4430,METHODS,Sciatic nerves of 30 Sprague Dawley male rats were used .
4431,METHODS,"Rats were divided into 5 groups ; group 1 ( n = 6 ) , control group ; group 2 ( n = 6 ) , axonotmesis + placebo group ; group 3 ( n = 6 ) , axonotmesis + 50 mg/kg agmatine treatment group ; group 4 ( n = 6 ) , neurotmesis + placebo group ; group 5 ( n = 6 ) , neurotmesis + 50 mg/kg agmatine treatment group ."
4432,METHODS,"Axonolysis , axon degeneration , edema , hemorrhage , and inflammation were evaluated in histopathologic examinations of all the groups ."
4433,RESULTS,"When group 2 was compared with group 3 in histopathologic sections , axonolysis was less in group 3 ( p = 0.007 ) , as was axon degeneration ( p = 0.022 ) and edema ( p = 0.018 ) ."
4434,RESULTS,"When group 4 was compared with group 5 , axonolysis was less in group 5 ( p = 0.009 ) , as was axon degeneration ( p = 0.006 ) and edema ( p = 0.021 ) ."
4435,CONCLUSIONS,This study demonstrated agmatine to have antioxidant and antineurotoxic effects in an experimental rat peripheral nerve injury model .
4436,BACKGROUND,"Health-related quality of life is often collected in clinical studies , and forms a cornerstone of economic evaluation ."
4437,BACKGROUND,"This study had two objectives , firstly to report and compare pre - and post-progression health state utilities in advanced melanoma when valued by different methods and secondly to explore the validity of progression-based health state utility modelling compared to modelling based upon time to death ."
4438,METHODS,Utilities were generated from the ipilimumab MDX010-20 trial ( Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00094653 ) using the condition-specific EORTC QLQ-C30 ( via the EORTC-8D ) and generic SF-36v2 ( via the SF-6D ) preference-based measures .
4439,METHODS,"Analyses by progression status and time to death were conducted on the patient-level data from the MDX010-20 trial using generalised estimating equations fitted in Stata , and the predictive abilities of the two approaches compared ."
4440,RESULTS,Mean utility showed a decrease on disease progression in both the EORTC-8D ( 0.813 to 0.776 ) and the SF-6D ( 0.648 to 0.626 ) .
4441,RESULTS,"Whilst higher utilities were obtained using the EORTC-8D , the relative decrease in utility on progression was similar between measures ."
4442,RESULTS,"When analysed by time to death , both EORTC-8D and SF-6D showed a large decrease in utility in the 180 days prior to death ( from 0.831 to 0.653 and from 0.667 to 0.544 , respectively ) ."
4443,RESULTS,"Compared to progression status alone , the use of time to death gave similar or better estimates of the original data when used to predict patient utility in the MDX010-20 study ."
4444,RESULTS,Including both progression status and time to death further improved model fit .
4445,RESULTS,Utilities seen in MDX010-20 were also broadly comparable with those seen in the literature .
4446,CONCLUSIONS,"Patient-level utility data should be analysed prior to constructing economic models , as analysis solely by progression status may not capture all predictive factors of patient utility and time to death may , as death approaches , be as or more important ."
4447,CONCLUSIONS,Additionally this study adds to the body of evidence showing that different scales lead to different health state values .
4448,CONCLUSIONS,"Further research is needed on how different utility instruments ( the SF-6D , EORTC-8D and EQ-5D ) relate to each other in different disease areas ."
4449,BACKGROUND,Recent technological advances in nebulization permit researchers to target specific parts of the lungs by modifying delivery method .
4450,BACKGROUND,The aim of this study was to compare the central and peripheral targeted modalities of administration .
4451,METHODS,Lung and regional deposition of inhaled technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic was measured by scintigraphy after peripheral and central targeted modalities of administration with an Akita device in 6 healthy subjects .
4452,RESULTS,"Drug targeting nebulization delivered a large amount of drug into the peripheral part of the lung independent of the modality ( outer-to-inner deposition ratio of 1.24 0.21 vs. 1.22 0.14 for central and peripheral modalities , respectively ) , but there was no difference in lung deposition ( whole-body deposition , 83.3 6.5 % vs. 82.8 7.3 % , P = .86 ) or regional deposition ( P = .77 ) between both modalities ."
4453,RESULTS,"The extrathoracic deposition was < 20 % of the whole-body deposition , without a difference between modalities ( P = .86 ) ."
4454,CONCLUSIONS,This study shows for the first time that choosing 2 different specific drug targeting nebulization modes does not influence the amount of drug delivered into the lung in healthy male subjects .
4455,CONCLUSIONS,"Moreover , the modes do not modify the site of deposition under the conditions of our study ."
4456,OBJECTIVE,To assess whether an oxygen saturation ( Spo2 ) target of 85 % -89 % compared with 91 % -95 % reduced the incidence of the composite outcome of death or major disability at 2 years of age in infants born at < 28 weeks ' gestation .
4457,METHODS,A total 340 infants were randomized to a lower or higher target from < 24 hours of age until 36 weeks ' gestational age .
4458,METHODS,Blinding was achieved by targeting a displayed Spo2 of 88 % -92 % using a saturation monitor offset by 3 % within the range 85 % -95 % .
4459,METHODS,True saturations were displayed outside this range .
4460,METHODS,Follow-up at 2 years ' corrected age was by pediatric examination and formal neurodevelopmental assessment .
4461,METHODS,"Major disability was gross motor disability , cognitive or language delay , severe hearing loss , or blindness ."
4462,RESULTS,The primary outcome was known for 335 infants with 33 using surrogate language information .
4463,RESULTS,"Targeting a lower compared with a higher Spo2 target range had no significant effect on the rate of death or major disability at 2 years ' corrected age ( 65/167 [ 38.9 % ] vs 76/168 [ 45.2 % ] ; relative risk 1.15 , 95 % CI 0.90-1 .47 ) or any secondary outcomes ."
4464,RESULTS,"Death occurred in 25 ( 14.7 % ) and 27 ( 15.9 % ) of those randomized to the lower and higher target , respectively , and blindness in 0 % and 0.7 % ."
4465,CONCLUSIONS,"Although there was no benefit or harm from targeting a lower compared with a higher saturation in this trial , further information will become available from the prospectively planned meta-analysis of this and 4 other trials comprising a total of nearly 5000 infants ."
4466,OBJECTIVE,"Insulin degludec/insulin aspart ( IDegAsp ) is the first combination of a basal insulin with an ultralong duration of action , and a rapid-acting insulin in a single injection ."
4467,OBJECTIVE,This trial compared IDegAsp with biphasic insulin aspart 30 ( BIAsp 30 ) in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with once - or twice-daily ( OD or BID ) pre - or self-mixed insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs .
4468,METHODS,"In this 26-week , randomized , open-label , multinational , treat-to-target trial , participants ( mean age 58.7 years , duration of diabetes 13 years , BMI 29.3 kg/m ( 2 ) , and HbA1c 8.4 % [ 68 mmol/mol ] ) were exposed ( 1:1 ) to BID injections of IDegAsp ( n = 224 ) or BIAsp 30 ( n = 222 ) , administered with breakfast and the main evening meal and dose titrated to a self-measured premeal plasma glucose ( PG ) target of 4.0-5 .0 mmol/L ."
4469,RESULTS,"After 26 weeks , mean HbA1c was 7.1 % ( 54 mmol/mol ) for both groups , with IDegAsp achieving the prespecified noninferiority margin for mean change in HbA1c ( estimated treatment difference [ ETD ] -0.03 % points [ 95 % CI -0.18 to 0.13 ] ) ."
4470,RESULTS,"Treatment with IDegAsp was superior in lowering fasting PG ( ETD -1.14 mmol/L [ 95 % CI -1.53 to -0.76 ] , P < 0.001 ) and had a significantly lower final mean daily insulin dose ( estimated rate ratio 0.89 [ 95 % CI 0.83-0 .96 ] , P = 0.002 ) ."
4471,RESULTS,"Fewer confirmed , nocturnal confirmed , and severe hypoglycemia episodes were reported for IDegAsp compared with BIAsp 30 ."
4472,CONCLUSIONS,IDegAsp BID effectively improves HbA1c and fasting PG levels with fewer hypoglycemia episodes versus BIAsp 30 in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes previously treated with once - or twice-daily pre - or self-mixed insulin .
4473,BACKGROUND,Excessive intravenous fluid prescription may play a causal role in postoperative complications following major gastrointestinal resectional surgery .
4474,BACKGROUND,The aim of this study was to investigate whether fluid and salt restriction would decrease postoperative complications compared with a more modern controlled liberal regimen .
4475,METHODS,In this observer-blinded single-site randomized clinical trial consecutive patients undergoing major gastrointestinal resectional surgery were randomized to receive either a liberal control fluid regimen or a restricted fluid and salt regimen .
4476,METHODS,The primary outcome was postoperative complications of grade II and above ( moderate to severe ) .
4477,RESULTS,Some 240 patients ( 194 colorectal resections and 46 oesophagogastric resections ) were enrolled in the study ; 121 patients were randomized to the restricted regimen and 119 to the control ( liberal ) regimen .
4478,RESULTS,"During surgery the control group received a median ( interquartile range ) fluid volume of 2033 ( 1576-2500 ) ml and sodium input of 282 ( 213-339 ) mmol , compared with 1000 ( 690-1500 ) ml and 142 ( 93-218 ) mmol respectively in the restricted group ."
4479,RESULTS,There was no significant difference in major complication rate between groups ( 380 and 390 per cent respectively ) .
4480,RESULTS,Median ( range ) hospital stay was 8 ( 3-101 ) days in the controls and 8 ( range 3-76 ) days among those who received restricted fluids .
4481,RESULTS,There were four in-hospital deaths in the control group and two in the restricted group .
4482,RESULTS,"Substantial differences in weight change , serum sodium , osmolality and urine : serum osmolality ratio were observed between the groups ."
4483,CONCLUSIONS,"There were no significant differences in major complication rates , length of stay and in-hospital deaths when fluid restriction was used compared with a more liberal regimen ."

4485,BACKGROUND,Sample size calculations for treatment trials that aim to assess health-related quality-of-life ( HRQOL ) outcomes are often difficult to perform .
4486,BACKGROUND,"Researchers must select a target minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ) in HRQOL for the trial , estimate the effect size of the intervention , and then consider the responsiveness of different HRQOL measures for detecting improvements ."
4487,BACKGROUND,"Generic preference-based HRQOL measures are usually less sensitive to gains in HRQOL than are disease-specific measures , but are nonetheless recommended to quantify an impact on HRQOL that can be translated into quality-adjusted life-years during cost-effectiveness analyses ."
4488,BACKGROUND,Mapping disease-specific measures onto generic measures is a proposed method for yielding more efficient sample size requirements while retaining the ability to generate utility weights for cost-effectiveness analyses .
4489,OBJECTIVE,This study sought to test this mapping strategy to calculate and compare the effect on sample size of three different methods .
4490,METHODS,"Three different methods were used for determining an MCID in HRQOL in patients with incontinence : 1 ) a global rating of improvement , 2 ) an incontinence-specific HRQOL instrument , and 3 ) a generic preference-based HRQOL instrument using mapping coefficients ."
4491,RESULTS,"The sample size required to detect a 20 % difference in the MCID for the global rating of improvement was 52 per trial arm , 172 per arm for the incontinence-specific HRQOL outcome , and 500 per arm for the generic preference-based HRQOL outcome ."
4492,CONCLUSIONS,We caution that treatment trials of conditions for which improvements are not easy to measure on generic HRQOL instruments will still require significantly greater sample size even when mapping functions are used to try to gain efficiency .
4493,BACKGROUND,Sleep deprivation is common in critically ill patients in intensive care units ( ICU ) .
4494,BACKGROUND,"It can result in delirium , difficulty weaning , repeated nosocomial infections , prolonged ICU length of stay and increased ICU mortality ."
4495,BACKGROUND,"Melatonin , a physiological sleep regulator , is well known to benefit sleep quality in certain people , but evidence for the effectiveness in ICU sleep disturbance is limited ."
4496,METHODS,"This study has a prospective , randomized , double-blind , controlled , parallel-group design ."
4497,METHODS,"Eligible patients are randomly assigned to one of the two treatment study groups , labelled the ` melatonin group ' or the ` placebo group ' ."
4498,METHODS,A dose of 3 mg of oral melatonin or placebo is administered at 9:00 pm on four consecutive days .
4499,METHODS,Earplugs and eye masks are made available to every participant .
4500,METHODS,We plan to enrol 198 patients .
4501,METHODS,The primary outcome is the objective sleep quality measured by the 24-hour polysomnography .
4502,METHODS,"The secondary outcomes are the subjective sleep quality assessed by the Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire , the anxiety level evaluated by the Visual Analogue Scale-Anxiety , the number of delirium-free days in 8 and 28 days , the number of ventilation-free days in 28 days , the number of antibiotic-free days , ICU length of stay , the overall ICU mortality in 28 days and the incidence and severity of the side effects of melatonin in ICU patients ."
4503,METHODS,"Additionally , the body stress levels , oxidative stress levels and inflammation levels are obtained via measuring the plasma melatonin , cortisone , norepinephrine , malonaldehyde ( MDA ) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) concentrations ."
4504,CONCLUSIONS,"The proposed study will be the first randomized controlled study to use the polysomnography , which is the gold standard of assessing sleep quality , to evaluate the effect of melatonin on the sleep quality and circadian rhythms of ICU patients ."
4505,CONCLUSIONS,"The results may recommend a new treatment for ICU patients with sleep deprivation that is safe , effective and easily implementable in daily practice ."
4506,BACKGROUND,This study was registered with ClinicalTrials ( NCT ; registration number : ChiCTR-TRC-14004319 ) on 4 March 2013 .
4507,BACKGROUND,Various studies have linked the occurrence of cardiovascular events and low ambient temperatures as well as the morning blood pressure surge ( MBPS ) .
4508,BACKGROUND,We hypothesized that low ambient temperatures produce a higher sympathetic change during the last rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep transition and that this may play an important role in cold-related cardiovascular events .
4509,METHODS,"All experiments were carried out on 12 healthy male adults , aged 24.000.74 years , who participated in two experimental conditions randomly ( > 1 day apart ) : warm ( 23 C ) and cold ( 16C ) ."
4510,METHODS,Blood pressure ( BP ) was measured every 30 min for 24 h by autonomic ambulatory BP monitoring .
4511,METHODS,"The electroencephalograms , electrocardiograms , ambient temperature , near-body temperature , and physical activity were recorded by miniature polysomnography for 24 h."
4512,RESULTS,"The cold conditions resulted in : ( i ) higher MBPS than under warm conditions ; ( ii ) significant and greater sympathetic index changes during the sleep-wake transition than during cover-to-uncover and supine-to-sit position tests ; ( iii ) the non-REM-REM transition-related sympathetic elevation during the cold conditions being significantly higher in late sleep period than in early sleep period ; ( iv ) at 1h prior to morning awakening , the value of total power of heart rate variability changes being significantly negatively correlated with the changes of near-body temperature ; and ( v ) significantly higher arousal index and shorter average interval of REM periods than in warm conditions ."
4513,CONCLUSIONS,"Cold exposure elevates the amplitude of MBPS and is associated with late sleep stage transition sympathetic activation , which might have important implications for cold-related cardiovascular events ."
4514,BACKGROUND,Dignity therapy is a brief psychotherapy developed for patients living with a life-limiting illness .
4515,OBJECTIVE,To determine the influence of dignity therapy on depression and anxiety in inpatients with a terminal illness and experiencing a high level of distress in a palliative care unit .
4516,METHODS,A nonblinded phase II randomized controlled trial of 80 patients who were randomly assigned to one of two groups : intervention group ( dignity therapy + standard palliative care [ SPC ] ) or control group ( SPC alone ) .
4517,METHODS,"The main outcomes were depression and anxiety scores , as measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , and assessed at baseline ( T1 ) , day 4 ( T2 ) , day 15 ( T3 ) , and day 30 ( T4 ) of follow-up ."
4518,METHODS,This study is registered with www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN34354086 .

4695,RESULTS,The long-axis view for subclavian was associated with decreased time to cannulation ; there was no significant difference in time between the short-axis and long-axis views at the internal jugular site .
4696,RESULTS,"The prevalence of posterior wall penetration was internal jugular short axis 25 % , internal jugular long axis 21 % , subclavian short axis 64 % , and subclavian long axis 39 % ."
4697,RESULTS,"The odds of posterior wall penetration were significantly less in the subclavian long axis ( odds ratio , 0.3 ; 95 % CI , 0.1-0 .9 ) ."
4698,CONCLUSIONS,The long-axis view for the internal jugular was more efficient than the short-axis view with fewer redirections .
4699,CONCLUSIONS,The long-axis view for subclavian central venous catheterization was also more efficient with decreased time to cannulation and fewer redirections .
4700,CONCLUSIONS,The long-axis approach to subclavian central venous catheterization is also associated with fewer posterior wall penetrations .
4701,CONCLUSIONS,Using the long-axis view for subclavian central venous catheterization and avoiding posterior wall penetrations may result in fewer central venous catheter-related complications .
4702,BACKGROUND,"IGF-I is thought to mediate many of the anabolic actions of GH , and there are anecdotal reports that IGF-I is misused by elite athletes ."
4703,BACKGROUND,There is no published evidence regarding the effects of IGF-I administration on athletic performance .
4704,OBJECTIVE,The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of IGF-I administration on body composition and physical fitness in recreational athletes .
4705,METHODS,"This was a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled recombinant human ( rh ) IGF-I/rhIGF binding protein ( IGFBP ) -3 administration study at Southampton General Hospital ( Southampton , United Kingdom ) ."
4706,METHODS,"Fifty-six recreational athletes ( 30 men , 26 women ) participated in the study ."
4707,METHODS,"Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo , low-dose rhIGF-I/rhIGFBP -3 ( 30 mg/d ) , or high dose rhIGF-I/rhIGFBP -3 ( 60 mg/d ) for 28 days ."
4708,METHODS,Body composition ( assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ) and cardiorespiratory fitness ( assessed by incremental treadmill test ) were measured before and immediately after treatment .
4709,METHODS,Within-individual changes after treatment were analyzed using paired t tests .
4710,RESULTS,There were no significant changes in body fat mass or lean body mass in women or men after the administration of the rhIGF-I/rhIGFBP -3 complex .
4711,RESULTS,There was a significant increase in maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2 max ) after treatment .
4712,RESULTS,"When women and men and low - and high-dose treatment groups were combined , mean VO2 max increased by approximately 7 % ( P = .001 ) ."
4713,RESULTS,No significant change in VO2 max was observed in the placebo group .
4714,CONCLUSIONS,"rhIGF-I/rhIGFBP -3 administration for 28 days improves aerobic performance in recreational athletes , but there are no effects on body composition ."
4715,OBJECTIVE,To compare the effectiveness of conventional and game-based oral health education on the oral health-related knowledge and oral hygiene status among 5 - to 10-year-old schoolchildren .
4716,METHODS,A total of 120 children aged 5 to 10 years were divided into 2 groups .
4717,METHODS,Each group had 30 children aged 5 to 7 years and 30 children aged 8 to 10 years .
4718,METHODS,A pretest evaluation of their knowledge regarding oral health and the estimation of Debris Index-Simplified ( DI-S ) was carried out .
4719,METHODS,Children in group A were given oral health education through flash cards once daily for 7 days .
4720,METHODS,Children in group B were educated through the play method ( i.e. snakes and ladders game combined with flash cards ) .
4721,METHODS,The evaluations regarding oral hygiene and DI-S were recorded on post-intervention day 1 and 3 months after the intervention .
4722,RESULTS,"In group B , high knowledge scores of 14.6 and 14.47 were obtained by the 5 - to 7-year-olds and 8 - to 10-yearolds , respectively , on post-intervention day 1 ."
4723,RESULTS,The lowest mean percentage difference of 8.9 was seen in 5 - to 7-yearold children of group A after 3 months .
4724,RESULTS,In group B ( 5-7 and 8-10 ) and group A ( 8-10 ) there was a significant increase in good oral hygiene scores and a significant decrease in fair and poor debris scores on post-intervention day 1 and at the 3-month follow-up .
4725,CONCLUSIONS,The knowledge scores of both the younger and older groups of children increased considerably when the game-based teaching intervention was used .
4726,CONCLUSIONS,"Hence , it can be an effective aid for teaching basic oral health concepts to children ."
4727,OBJECTIVE,"This single-center , randomized , clinical trial was designed to determine the 10-year comparative efficacy and durability of carotid angioplasty and stenting ( CAS ) versus carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) in preventing ipsilateral ischemic stroke in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis ."
4728,BACKGROUND,Modern clinical trials with short-term follow-up indicate CAS and CEA are equivalent in reducing the risk for ipsilateral ischemic stroke secondary to carotid stenosis .
4729,BACKGROUND,A paucity of data exists regarding long-term outcomes .
4730,METHODS,Patients of all surgical risks with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis ( > 70 % ) were randomly selected for CEA or CAS and followed a minimum of 10 years .
4731,RESULTS,Long-term follow-up was achieved in 173 patients ( 91 % ) .
4732,RESULTS,"Eighty-seven ( 50.2 % ) died within this period , most commonly of nonvascular causes ."
4733,RESULTS,No difference in the risk of stroke ipsilateral to the treated artery was noted among treatment groups ( p > 0.05 ) .
4734,RESULTS,Restenosis determined by sequential ultrasound was assessed only in the CAS group ( 3.3 % ) and remained asymptomatic .
4735,RESULTS,"The combined risk of fatal or nonfatal heart attack over the 10-year period was highest in individuals with symptomatic versus asymptomatic stenosis ( 27.5 % vs. 11.0 % ; hazard ratio [ HR ] : 2.32 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.298 to 4.146 , p = 0.005 ) and was higher in all patients treated with CEA ( HR : 2.27 , 95 % CI : 1.35 to 3.816 , p = 0.002 ) ."
4736,CONCLUSIONS,Long-term protection against ipsilateral stroke provided by CAS and CEA did not differ in this trial .
4737,CONCLUSIONS,The 10-year risk of fatal/nonfatal myocardial infarction was highest in all patients harboring symptomatic carotid stenosis at enrollment .
4738,CONCLUSIONS,The risk of fatal/nonfatal heart attack was significantly more prevalent in those symptomatic or asymptomatic patients randomized to CEA .
4739,BACKGROUND,Reductions in drinking among individuals randomised to control groups in brief alcohol intervention trials are common and suggest that asking study participants about their drinking may itself cause them to reduce their consumption .
4740,BACKGROUND,We sought to test the hypothesis that the statistical artefact regression to the mean ( RTM ) explains part of the reduction in such studies .
4741,METHODS,967 participants in a cohort study of alcohol consumption in New Zealand provided data at baseline and again six months later .
4742,METHODS,"We use graphical methods and apply thresholds of 8 , 12 , 16 and 20 in AUDIT scores to explore RTM ."
4743,RESULTS,"There was a negative association between baseline AUDIT scores and change in AUDIT scores from baseline to six months , which in the absence of bias and confounding , is RTM ."
4744,RESULTS,"Students with lower baseline scores tended to have higher follow-up scores and conversely , those with higher baseline scores tended to have lower follow-up scores ."
4745,RESULTS,"When a threshold score of 8 was used to select a subgroup , the observed mean change was approximately half of that observed without a threshold ."
4746,RESULTS,The application of higher thresholds produced greater apparent reductions in alcohol consumption .
4747,CONCLUSIONS,Part of the reduction seen in the control groups of brief alcohol intervention trials is likely to be due to RTM and the amount of change is likely to be greater as the threshold for entry to the trial increases .
4748,CONCLUSIONS,Quantification of RTM warrants further study and should assist understanding assessment and other research participation effects .
4749,BACKGROUND,Clinical trials are increasingly being conducted as new products seek to enter the market .
4750,BACKGROUND,Deployment of such interventions is based on evidence obtained mainly from the gold standard of randomized controlled clinical trials ( RCCT ) .
4751,BACKGROUND,A crucial factor in the ability of RCCTs to provide credible and generalisable data is sample size and retention of the required number of subjects at completion of the follow-up period .
4752,BACKGROUND,"However , recruitment and retention in clinical trials are hindered by prevalent peculiar challenges in Africa that need to be circumvented ."
4753,BACKGROUND,This article shares experiences from a phase II trial that recorded a high retention rate at 14 months follow-up at a new clinical trial site .
4754,METHODS,Mothers bringing children less than two months of age to the health facility were given information and invited to have their child enrolled if the inclusion criteria were fulfilled .
4755,METHODS,Participants were enrolled over 8 months .
4756,METHODS,"Trial procedures , duration and risks/benefits were painstakingly and sequentially explained to the communities , parents and relevant relatives before and during the trial period ."
4757,METHODS,The proportions of participants that completed or did not complete the trial were analyzed including the reasons for failure to complete all trial procedures .
4758,RESULTS,1044 individuals received information regarding the trial of which 371 returned for screening .
4759,RESULTS,300 ( 81 % ) of them who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and did not meet any exclusion criteria were enrolled and 94 % of these completed the trial .
4760,RESULTS,Consent withdrawal was the main reason for not completing the trial largely ( 75 % ) due to the father not being involved at the point of consenting or parents no longer being comfortable with blood sampling .
4761,CONCLUSIONS,Participant retention in clinical trials remains a crucial factor in ensuring generalisability of trial data .
4762,CONCLUSIONS,"Appropriate measures to enhance retention should include continuous community involvement in the process , adequate explanation of trial procedures and risks/benefits ; and innovative tracing of participants adapted for the setting ."
4763,BACKGROUND,Symptomatic hip osteoarthritis ( OA ) is a disabling condition with up to a 25 % cumulative lifetime risk .
4764,BACKGROUND,Total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) is effective in relieving patients ' symptoms and improving function .
4765,BACKGROUND,"It is , however , associated with substantial risk of complications , pain and major functional limitation before patients can return to full function ."
4766,BACKGROUND,"In contrast , hip arthroscopy ( HA ) is less invasive and can postpone THA ."
4767,BACKGROUND,"However , there is no evidence regarding the delay in the need for THA that patients would find acceptable to undergoing HA ."
4768,BACKGROUND,Knowing patients ' values and preferences ( VP ) on this expected delay is critical when making recommendations regarding the advisability of HA .
4769,BACKGROUND,"Furthermore , little is known on the optimal amount of information regarding interventions and outcomes needed to present in order to optimally elicit patients ' VP ."
4770,METHODS,"We will perform a multinational , structured interview-based survey of preference in delay time for THA among patients with non-advanced OA who failed to respond to conservative therapy ."
4771,METHODS,We will combine these interviews with a randomised trial addressing the optimal amount of information regarding the interventions and outcomes required to elicit preferences .
4772,METHODS,Eligible patients will be randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) to either a short or a long format of health scenarios of THA and HA .
4773,METHODS,We will determine each patient 's VP using a trade-off and anticipated regret exercises .
4774,METHODS,"Our primary outcomes for the combined surveys will be : ( 1 ) the minimal delay time in the need for THA surgery that patients would find acceptable to undertaking HA , ( 2 ) patients ' satisfaction with the amount of information provided in the health scenarios used to elicit their VPs ."
4775,BACKGROUND,The protocol has been approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board ( HIREB13-506 ) .
4776,BACKGROUND,"We will disseminate our study findings through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations , and make them available to guideline makers issuing recommendations addressing HA and THA ."
4777,BACKGROUND,"From 2000 to 2012 , the annual incidence of inpatient treatment for distal radius fracture in Germany rose from 65 to 86 per 100 000 persons ."
4778,BACKGROUND,"It is unclear whether open reduction and volar angle-stable plate osteosynthesis ( ORIF ) , a currently advocated treatment , yields a better functional outcome or quality of life than closed reposition and casting ."
4779,METHODS,"In the ORCHID multi-center trial , 185 patients aged 65 and older with an AO type C distal radial fracture were randomly assigned to ORIF or closed reposition and casting ."
4780,METHODS,"Their health-related quality of life and hand/arm function were assessed 3 and 12 months afterward with the Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) questionnaire and the Disability of the Arm , Shoulder and Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire ."
4781,METHODS,"The radiological findings , range of movement of the wrist , and EuroQol-5D ( EQ-5D ) scores were documented as well ."
4782,RESULTS,"Among the 149 patients in the intention-to-treat-analysis , there was no significant difference in SF-36 scores between the two treatment groups at one year ( mean difference , 3.3 points in favor of ORIF ; 95 % confidence interval , -0.2 +6.8 points ; p = 0.058 ) ."
4783,RESULTS,"The DASH scores showed moderately strong , but clinically unimportant effects in favor of ORIF , and there was no difference in EQ-5D scores ."
4784,RESULTS,"ORIF led to better radiological results and wrist mobility at 3 months , with comparable results at 12 months ."
4785,RESULTS,37 of the patients initially allotted to nonsurgical treatment underwent secondary surgery due to significant loss of reduction .
4786,CONCLUSIONS,"The findings with respect to mobility , functionality , and quality of life at 12 months provide marginal and inconsistent evidence for the superiority of volar angle-stable plate osteosynthesis over closed reduction and casting in the treatment of intra-articular distal radius fractures ."
4787,CONCLUSIONS,Primary nonsurgical management is also effective in suitable patients .
4788,OBJECTIVE,"Secondary acute myeloid leukemia ( sAML ) , defined as AML arising after a prior myelodysplastic syndrome or after antineoplastic therapy , responds poorly to current therapies ."
4789,OBJECTIVE,It is often associated with adverse karyotypic abnormalities and overexpression of proteins that mediate drug resistance .
4790,OBJECTIVE,"We performed a phase III trial to determine whether induction therapy with cytarabine and amonafide L-malate , a DNA intercalator and non-ATP-dependent topoisomerase II inhibitor that evades drug resistance mechanisms , yielded a superior complete remission rate than standard therapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin in sAML ."
4791,METHODS,Patients with previously untreated sAML were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to cytarabine 200 mg/m ( 2 ) continuous intravenous ( IV ) infusion once per day on days 1 to 7 plus either amonafide 600 mg/m ( 2 ) IV over 4 hours on days 1 to 5 ( A + C arm ) or daunorubicin 45 mg/m ( 2 ) IV over 30 minutes once per day on days 1 to 3 ( D + C arm ) .
4792,RESULTS,The complete remission ( CR ) rate was 46 % ( 99 of 216 patients ) in A + C arm and 45 % ( 97 of 217 patients ) in D + C arm ( P = .81 ) .
4793,RESULTS,"The 30 - and 60-day mortality rates were 19 % and 28 % in A + C arm and 13 % and 21 % in D + C arm , respectively ."
4794,CONCLUSIONS,Induction treatment with A + C did not improve the CR rate compared with D + C in patients with sAML .
4795,OBJECTIVE,To investigate the clinical efficacy of three toothpastes in controlling established gingivitis and plaque over 6 months .
4796,METHODS,"135 subjects were enrolled in a single-center , double-blind , parallel group , randomized clinical study ."
4797,METHODS,"Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatments : triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice containing 0.3 % triclosan , 2.0 % copolymer and 1,450 ppm F as sodium fluoride in a silica base ; herbal/bicarbonate dentifrice containing herbal extract and 1,400 ppm F as sodium fluoride in a sodium bicarbonate base ; or fluoride dentifrice containing 450 ppm F as sodium fluoride , and 1,000 ppm F as sodium monofluorophosphate ."
4798,METHODS,Subjects were instructed to brush their teeth twice daily for 1 minute for 6 months .
4799,RESULTS,"After 6 months , subjects assigned to the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride group exhibited statistically significant reductions in gingival index scores and plaque index scores as compared to subjects assigned to the herbal/bicarbonate group by 35.4 % and 48.9 % , respectively ."
4800,RESULTS,There were no statistically significant differences in gingival index and plaque index between subjects in the herbal / bicarbonate group and those in the fluoride group .
4801,RESULTS,"The triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice was statistically significantly more effective in reducing gingivitis and dental plaque than the herbal/bicarbonate dentifrice , and this difference in efficacy was clinically meaningful ."
4802,BACKGROUND,"Although asthma is characterized by variable airways obstruction , most studies of asthma phenotypes are cross-sectional ."
4803,BACKGROUND,The stability of phenotypes defined either by biomarkers or by physiological variables was assessed by repeated measures over 1year in the Pan-European BIOAIR cohort of adult asthmatics .
4804,METHODS,"A total of 169 patients , 93 with severe asthma ( SA ) and 76 with mild-to-moderate asthma ( MA ) , were examined at six or more visits during 1year ."
4805,METHODS,"Asthma phenotype clusters were defined by physiological variables ( lung function , reversibility and age of onset of the disease ) or by biomarkers ( eosinophils and neutrophils in induced sputum ) ."
4806,RESULTS,"After 1year of follow-up , the allocation to clusters was changed in 23.6 % of all asthma patients when defined by physiological phenotypes and , remarkably , in 42.3 % of the patients when stratified according to sputum cellularity ( P = 0.034 ) ."
4807,RESULTS,"In the SA cohort , 30 % and 48.6 % of the patients changed allocation according to physiological and biomarker clustering , respectively ."
4808,RESULTS,"Variability of phenotypes was not influenced by change in oral or inhaled corticosteroid dose , nor by the number of exacerbations ."
4809,RESULTS,"Lower stability of single and repeated measure was found for all evaluated biomarkers ( eosinophils , neutrophils and FeNO ) in contrast to good stability of physiological variables ( FEV1 ) , quality of life and asthma control ."
4810,CONCLUSIONS,"Phenotypes determined by biomarkers are less stable than those defined by physiological variables , especially in severe asthmatics ."
4811,CONCLUSIONS,"The data also imply that definition of asthma phenotypes is improved by repeated measures to account for fluctuations in lung function , biomarkers and asthma control ."
4812,OBJECTIVE,"To investigate women 's understanding of prenatal testing options and of their own experience with screening , diagnostic genetic testing , or both ."
4813,METHODS,This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of enhanced information and values clarification regarding prenatal genetic testing in the absence of financial barriers to testing .
4814,METHODS,"Women in the third trimester of pregnancy were asked whether they had discussed prenatal genetic testing with their health care providers , whether they understood this testing was optional , and whether they had undergone testing during their pregnancy ."
4815,METHODS,Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to determine independent predictors of these outcomes .
4816,RESULTS,Data were available from 710 study participants .
4817,RESULTS,Discussions about screening tests were reported by 654 participants ( 92 % ) ; only 412 ( 58 % ) reported discussing diagnostic testing .
4818,RESULTS,"That screening and diagnostic testing were optional was evident to approximately two thirds of women ( n = 470 and 455 , respectively ) ."
4819,RESULTS,Recall of actual tests undergone was correct for 626 ( 88 % ) for screening and for 700 ( 99 % ) for diagnostic testing .
4820,RESULTS,"Racial , ethnic and socioeconomic variation existed in the understanding of whether screening and diagnostic tests were optional and in the correct recall of whether screening had been undertaken in the current pregnancy ."
4821,RESULTS,"In the usual care group , women receiving care in low-income settings were less likely to recall being offered diagnostic testing ( adjusted odds ratio 0.23 [ 0.14-0 .39 ] ) ."
4822,CONCLUSIONS,Disparities exist in women 's recall of prenatal genetic testing discussions and their understanding of their own experience .
4823,CONCLUSIONS,Interventions that explain testing options to women and help clarify their preferences may help to eliminate these differences .
4824,BACKGROUND,New antithrombotic drugs for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders in AF that are less demanding on local staff and facilities than warfarin should be welcomed if proved successful .
4825,OBJECTIVE,The comparative value and possible dangers of substituting the new drug dabigatran as a replacement remain to be established .
4826,OBJECTIVE,Its safety and effectiveness must be reviewed and assessed by further study .
4827,METHODS,Clinical results of the European Action on Anticoagulation ( EAA ) computer-assisted dosage study and the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy ( RE-LY ) trial have been compared .
4828,RESULTS,Clinical events were lower in patients on warfarin in the EAA study compared to patients on both warfarin and dabigatran in the RE-LY study .
4829,CONCLUSIONS,Evaluations should recognize optimum requirements for safe and effective administration of both types of drug .
4830,CONCLUSIONS,In the warfarin arm improvements in effectiveness and safety recently introduced ( i.e. the PT/INR line and variance growth analysis ) should be included as they have been shown to be successful in improved prediction of bleeding and further thromboembolism .
4831,CONCLUSIONS,"The incidence of bleeding with dabigatran , for which there is no antidote , will require evaluation ."
4832,BACKGROUND,Cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) concentrations are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcome in primary prevention populations .
4833,BACKGROUND,Whether statin therapy modifies this association is poorly understood .
4834,RESULTS,We measured high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I ( hsTnI ) in 12956 and BNP in 11076 participants without cardiovascular disease in the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention : An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin ( JUPITER ) trial before randomization to rosuvastatin 20 mg/d or placebo .
4835,RESULTS,"Nearly 92 % of participants had detectable circulating hsTnI , and 2.9 % of men and 4.1 % of women had levels above proposed sex-specific reference limits of 36 and 15 ng/L , respectively ."
4836,RESULTS,"hsTnI concentrations in the highest tertile were associated with a first major cardiovascular event ( adjusted hazard ratio [ aHR ] , 2.19 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.56-3 .06 ; P for trend < 0.001 ) ."
4837,RESULTS,"BNP levels in the highest tertile were also associated a first cardiovascular event ( aHR , 1.94 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.41-2 .68 ; P for trend < 0.001 ) ."
4838,RESULTS,"The risk of all-cause mortality was elevated for the highest versus the lowest tertiles of hsTnI ( aHR , 2.61 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.81-3 .78 ; P for trend < 0.001 ) and BNP ( aHR , 1.45 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.03-2 .04 ; P for trend 0.02 ) ."
4839,RESULTS,"Rosuvastatin was equally effective in preventing a first cardiovascular event across categories of hsTnI ( aHR range , 0.50-0 .60 ) and BNP ( aHR range , 0.42-0 .67 ) with no statistically significant evidence of interaction ( P for interaction = 0.53 and 0.20 , respectively ) ."
4840,CONCLUSIONS,"In a contemporary primary prevention population , baseline cardiac troponin I and BNP were associated with the risk of vascular events and all-cause mortality ."
4841,CONCLUSIONS,The benefits of rosuvastatin were substantial and consistent regardless of baseline hsTnI or BNP concentrations .

4844,OBJECTIVE,To test the efficacy of nutritional guidelines for school lunch cooks aiming to reduce added sugar in school meals and their own sugar intake .
4845,METHODS,"A controlled randomized cluster trial was carried out in twenty public schools in the municipality of Niteroi in Rio de Janeiro , Southeastern Brazil , from March to December 2007 ."
4846,METHODS,"A nutrition educational program was implemented in the schools in question through messages , activities and printed educational materials encouraging reduced levels of added sugar in school meals and in the school lunch cooks ' own intake ."
4847,METHODS,The reduced availability of added sugar in schools was evaluated using spreadsheets including data on the monthly use of food item supplies .
4848,METHODS,The cooks ' individual food intake was evaluated by a Food Frequency Questionnaire .
4849,METHODS,Anthropometric measurements were taken according to standardized techniques and variation in weight was measured throughout the duration of the study .
4850,RESULTS,"There was a more marked reduction in the intervention schools compared to the control schools ( -6.0 kg versus 0.34 kg ) , but no statistically significant difference ( p = 0.21 ) , although the study power was low ."
4851,RESULTS,"Both groups of school lunch cooks showed a reduction in the consumption of sweets and sweetened beverages , but the difference in sugar intake was not statistically significant ."
4852,RESULTS,"Weight loss and a reduction in total energy consumption occurred in both groups , but the difference between them was not statistically significant , and there was no alteration in the percentages of adequacy of macronutrients in relation to energy consumption ."
4853,CONCLUSIONS,The strategy of reducing the use and consumption of sugar by school lunch cooks from public schools could not be proved to be effective .
4854,OBJECTIVE,To characterize via NMR spectroscopy the full spectrum of metabolic changes in umbilical vein blood plasma of newborns diagnosed with different clinical forms of intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) .
4855,METHODS,23 early IUGR cases and matched 23 adequate-for-gestational-age ( AGA ) controls and 56 late IUGR cases with 56 matched AGAs were included in this study .
4856,METHODS,"Early IUGR was defined as a birth weight < 10 ( th ) centile , abnormal umbilical artery ( UA ) Doppler and delivery < 35 weeks ."
4857,METHODS,Late IUGR was defined as a birth weight < 10 ( th ) centile with normal UA Doppler and delivery > 35 weeks .
4858,METHODS,This group was subdivided in 18 vasodilated ( VD ) and 38 non-VD late IUGR fetuses .
4859,METHODS,All AGA patients had a birth weight > 10 ( th ) centile .
4860,METHODS,( 1 ) H nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) metabolomics of the blood samples collected from the umbilical vein at delivery was obtained .
4861,METHODS,"Multivariate statistical analysis identified several metabolites that allowed the discrimination between the different IUGR subgroups , and their comparative levels were quantified from the NMR data ."
4862,RESULTS,"The NMR-based analysis showed increased unsaturated lipids and VLDL levels in both early and late IUGR samples , decreased glucose and increased acetone levels in early IUGR ."
4863,RESULTS,"Non-significant trends for decreased glucose and increased acetone levels were present in late IUGR , which followed a severity gradient when the VD and non-VD subgroups were considered ."

4922,BACKGROUND,Fixed-dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine ( FDC-I/H ) reduced mortality by 43 % and death or first hospitalization for heart failure ( HF ) by 37 % in the African-American Heart Failure Trial ( A-HeFT ) .
4923,BACKGROUND,Reduction in mortality makes it difficult to determine the effect on hospitalizations unless the analysis adjusts for death as a competing risk .
4924,RESULTS,"In A-HeFT , 1050 self-identified black patients with moderate to severe HF were randomized to FDC-I/H or placebo ."
4925,RESULTS,The effects of FDC-I/H on first and all hospitalizations and 30-day readmission rates were analyzed .
4926,RESULTS,Deaths as competing risks were adjusted using Fine-Gray regression and joint models of hospitalizations and mortality .
4927,RESULTS,There were 558 all-cause and 251 HF hospitalizations in placebo compared with 435 and 173 hospitalizations in the FDC-I/H group .
4928,RESULTS,"Adjusting for deaths as a competing risk , the effect of FDC-I/H on the first hospitalization for HF , expressed in hazard ratio ( 95 % confidence interval ) , was 0.61 ( 0.47-0 .80 ; P < 0.001 ) and 0.88 ( 0.72-1 .06 ; P = 0.18 ) on the first all-cause hospitalization ."
4929,RESULTS,"The effect of FDC-I/H on all recurrent hospitalizations for HF was 0.66 ( 0.52-0 .83 ; P = 0.0005 ) , similar to the effect on the first hospitalizations for HF , whereas the effect on all hospitalizations for any cause was 0.75 ( 0.63-0 .91 ; P = 0.003 ) ."
4930,RESULTS,"The 30-day all-cause readmission rate after the first hospitalization for HF was 23.6 % ( 29 of 123 ) in placebo versus 14.8 % ( 12 of 81 ) in the FDC-I/H group , but the effect ( 0.59 ; 0.30-1 .16 ; P = 0.12 ) in this small subgroup was not significant ."
4931,CONCLUSIONS,"Treatment with FDC-I/H was associated with a substantial reduction in the first and recurrent HF hospitalizations , and in total all-cause hospitalizations , reducing the total burden of costly and distressing hospitalizations ."

4934,BACKGROUND,"Hemodialysis patients are at risk of serious health complications , yet treatment non-adherence remains high ."
4935,OBJECTIVE,Warnings about health risks associated with non-adherence may trigger defensive reactions .
4936,OBJECTIVE,We studied whether an intervention based on self-affirmation theory ( Steele 1988 ) reduced patients ' resistance to health-risk information and improved adherence .
4937,METHODS,One hundred twelve patients either self-affirmed or completed a matched control task before reading about the risks associated with a lack of phosphate control .
4938,METHODS,Serum phosphate was collected from baseline up to 12months .
4939,RESULTS,Self-affirmed patients had significantly reduced serum phosphate levels at 1 and 12months .
4940,RESULTS,"However , contrary to the predictions derived from self-affirmation theory , self-affirmed participants and controls did not differ in their evaluation of the health-risk information , behavioural intention or self-efficacy ."
4941,CONCLUSIONS,"A low-cost , high-reach health intervention based on self-affirmation theory was shown to reduce serum phosphate over a 12month period ."

4943,BACKGROUND,"Bardoxolone methyl , an Nrf2-activating and nuclear factor-B-inhibiting semisynthetic oleanane triterpenoid compound , was evaluated in a phase 3 trial ( BEACON ) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and stage 4 chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ."
4944,BACKGROUND,"The trial was terminated because of an increase in heart failure events in the bardoxolone methyl group , many of which appeared related to fluid retention ."
4945,BACKGROUND,"Thus , additional analyses were conducted to explain these serious adverse events ."
4946,METHODS,"Patients ( n = 2,185 ) were randomized to receive once-daily bardoxolone methyl ( 20 mg ) or placebo ."
4947,METHODS,"Twenty-four-hour urine collections were analyzed in a subset of the BEACON population and from a separate , open-label pharmacology study in patients with stage 3b/4 CKD and T2DM administered 20 mg bardoxolone methyl once daily for 56 consecutive days ."
4948,RESULTS,"Bardoxolone-methyl-treated patients in the BEACON substudy had a clinically meaningful reduction in urine volume and sodium excretion at week 4 relative to baseline ( p < 0.05 ) , and a separate study revealed that decreased sodium excretion and urine output occurred in some patients with stage 4 CKD but not those with stage 3b CKD ."
4949,RESULTS,"The clinical phenotype of fluid overload and heart failure in BEACON was similar to that observed with endothelin receptor antagonists in advanced CKD patients , and preclinical data demonstrate that bardoxolone methyl modifies endothelin signaling ."
4950,CONCLUSIONS,"The totality of the evidence suggests that through modulation of the endothelin pathway , bardoxolone methyl may pharmacologically promote acute sodium and volume retention and increase blood pressure in patients with more advanced CKD ."
4951,BACKGROUND,"Continuous theta burst stimulation ( cTBS ) of the human primary motor cortex ( M1 ) induces long-term depression ( LTD ) - like plastic changes in corticospinal excitability , but several studies have reported high inter-subject variability of this effect ."
4952,BACKGROUND,"Most studies use a tonic voluntary contraction of the target muscle before cTBS to set stimulation intensity ; however , it is unclear how this might affect response variability ."
4953,OBJECTIVE,To examine the influence of pre-activation of the target hand muscle on inter-subject response variability to cTBS of the human M1 .
4954,METHODS,The response to cTBS was assessed by changes in motor evoked potential ( MEP ) amplitude in the right first dorsal interosseous ( FDI ) muscle .
4955,METHODS,"For Study 1 , ten healthy subjects attended two sessions ."
4956,METHODS,"They were instructed in one session to keep their FDI relaxed for the entire testing period ( pre-relax ) , and in the other to perform a 2-min 10 % of maximal voluntary tonic contraction 15 min before cTBS ( pre-active ) ."
4957,METHODS,"For Study 2 , data from our previous study were re-analyzed to extend the pre-relax condition to an additional 26 subjects ( total n = 36 ) ."
4958,RESULTS,"cTBS-induced highly consistent LTD-like MEP depression in the pre-relax condition , but not in the pre-active condition ."
4959,RESULTS,Inter-subject response variability increased in the pre-active condition .
4960,CONCLUSIONS,cTBS induces consistent LTD-like plasticity with low inter-subject variability if pre-activation of the stimulated motor cortex is avoided .
4961,CONCLUSIONS,This affirms a translational potential of cTBS in clinical applications that aim at reducing cortical excitability .
4962,BACKGROUND,"Current thinking , which is based mainly on rodent studies , is that physiologic doses of folic acid ( pterylmonoglutamic acid ) , such as dietary vitamin folates , are biotransformed in the intestinal mucosa and transferred to the portal vein as the natural circulating plasma folate , 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid ( 5-MTHF ) before entering the liver and the wider systemic blood supply ."
4963,OBJECTIVE,"We tested the assumption that , in humans , folic acid is biotransformed ( reduced and methylated ) to 5-MTHF in the intestinal mucosa ."
4964,METHODS,We conducted a crossover study in which we sampled portal and peripheral veins for labeled folate concentrations after oral ingestion with physiologic doses of stable-isotope-labeled folic acid or the reduced folate 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid ( 5-FormylTHF ) in 6 subjects with a transjugular intrahepatic porto systemic shunt ( TIPSS ) in situ .
4965,METHODS,The TIPSS allowed blood samples to be taken from the portal vein .
4966,RESULTS,"Fifteen minutes after a dose of folic acid , 80 12 % of labeled folate in the hepatic portal vein was unmodified folic acid ."
4967,RESULTS,"In contrast , after a dose of labeled 5-FormylTHF , only 4 18 % of labeled folate in the portal vein was unmodified 5-FormylTHF , and the rest had been converted to 5-MTHF after 15 min ( postdose ) ."
4968,CONCLUSIONS,The human gut appears to have a very efficient capacity to convert reduced dietary folates to 5-MTHF but limited ability to reduce folic acid .
4969,CONCLUSIONS,"Therefore , large amounts of unmodified folic acid in the portal vein are probably attributable to an extremely limited mucosal cell dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) capacity that is necessary to produce tetrahydrofolic acid before sequential methylation to 5-MTHF ."
4970,CONCLUSIONS,This process would suggest that humans are reliant on the liver for folic acid reduction even though it has a low and highly variable DHFR activity .
4971,CONCLUSIONS,"Therefore , chronic liver exposure to folic acid in humans may induce saturation , which would possibly explain reports of systemic circulation of unmetabolized folic acid ."

4992,METHODS,A total of 491 participants were enrolled in the initial assessment of adherence .
4993,METHODS,"Of those , 70 were nonadherent with their medications after 3 months of electronic monitoring and randomized to intervention and control groups ."
4994,METHODS,A personal health record was used to store the list of patient medications and reminder preferences .
4995,METHODS,"On the basis of those data , participants randomized to the intervention received daily messages , either text or voice , reminding them to take their medication ."
4996,METHODS,Participants randomized to the control group received usual care .
4997,METHODS,Difference in adherence before and after initiation of the intervention .
4998,RESULTS,"Using an intent-to-treat analysis , we found that the median adherence rate in the 38 participants randomized to the intervention increased from 53 % to 64 % ( P < .05 ) ."
4999,RESULTS,There was no statistical change in 32 participants in the control group .
5000,RESULTS,"To assess the real efficacy of the intervention , the same comparison was performed for the participants who successfully completed the study after randomization ."
5001,RESULTS,"Analyzed this way , the adherence rate in the 20 participants in the intervention group increased from 54 % to 73 % ( P < .05 ) , whereas there was again no statistical change in the 19 participants in the control group ."
5002,RESULTS,Eighty-four percent of the participants who received reminders agreed they were helpful and would continue using them outside the study .
5003,CONCLUSIONS,Automated telecommunication-based reminders linked to data in a personal health record improved adherence with once-daily glaucoma medications .
5004,CONCLUSIONS,This is an effective method to improve adherence that could realistically be implemented in ophthalmology practices with a minimum amount of effort on the part of the practice or the patient .

5007,METHODS,"Adults with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were assigned rifapentine 10 , 15 , or 20 mg/kg or rifampin 10 mg/kg daily for 8 weeks ( intensive phase ) , with isoniazid , pyrazinamide , and ethambutol ."
5008,METHODS,The primary tolerability end point was treatment discontinuation .
5009,METHODS,The primary efficacy end point was negative sputum cultures at completion of intensive phase .
5010,RESULTS,A total of 334 participants were enrolled .
5011,RESULTS,"At completion of intensive phase , cultures on solid media were negative in 81.3 % of participants in the rifampin group versus 92.5 % ( P = 0.097 ) , 89.4 % ( P = 0.29 ) , and 94.7 % ( P = 0.049 ) in the rifapentine 10 , 15 , and 20 mg/kg groups ."

5110,METHODS,"This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00530894 ."
5111,RESULTS,"We screened 3015 patients , of whom 358 were enrolled ( mean age 83 years , Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality 117 % , 54 % female ) ."
5112,RESULTS,179 were assigned to TAVR treatment and 179 were assigned to standard treatment .
5113,RESULTS,"20 patients crossed over from the standard treatment group and ten withdrew from study , leaving only six patients at 5 years , of whom five had aortic valve replacement treatment outside of the study ."
5114,RESULTS,"The risk of all-cause mortality at 5 years was 718 % in the TAVR group versus 936 % in the standard treatment group ( hazard ratio 050 , 95 % CI 039-065 ; p < 00001 ) ."
5115,RESULTS,"At 5 years , 42 ( 86 % ) of 49 survivors in the TAVR group had New York Heart Association class 1 or 2 symptoms compared with three ( 60 % ) of five in the standard treatment group ."
5116,RESULTS,"Echocardiography after TAVR showed durable haemodynamic benefit ( aortic valve area 152 cm ( 2 ) at 5 years , mean gradient 106 mm Hg at 5 years ) , with no evidence of structural valve deterioration ."
5117,CONCLUSIONS,TAVR is more beneficial than standard treatment for treatment of inoperable aortic stenosis .
5118,CONCLUSIONS,TAVR should be strongly considered for patients who are not surgical candidates for aortic valve replacement to improve their survival and functional status .
5119,CONCLUSIONS,Appropriate selection of patients will help to maximise the benefit of TAVR and reduce mortality from severe comorbidities .

5134,OBJECTIVE,To investigate the effects of increasing end-tidal concentrations of desflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia in a background of propofol and remifentanil with multipulse cortical stimulation on intraoperative monitoring of MEPs .
5135,METHODS,"In this randomized crossover trial , 14 consecutive patients ( 7 in each arm ) undergoing major spine surgery , under a background anesthetic of propofol ( 75 to 125 mcg/kg/min ) and remifentanil ( 0.1 to 0.2 mcg/kg/min ) , were randomly assigned to receive the sequence of inhalational agents studied : either DES-SEVO ( desflurane followed by sevoflurane ) ; or SEVO-DES ( sevoflurane followed by desflurane ) ."
5136,METHODS,"Multiples ( 0.3 , 0.5 , and 0.7 ) of minimum alveolar concentration ( MAC ) of desflurane and sevoflurane were administered ."
5137,METHODS,"After a washout period of 15 minutes using high fresh oxygen/air flows , each of the patients then received the other gas as the second agent ."
5138,METHODS,"Cortical stimulation was achieved with a train of 5 equivalent square pulses , each 0.05 ms in duration , delivered at 2 ms intervals ."
5139,METHODS,MEP recordings were made in the upper limb ( UL ) from first dorsal interosseus and lower limb ( LL ) from tibialis anterior with subdermal needle electrodes .
5140,RESULTS,"At 0.3 MAC desflurane , there was no statistical significant difference in transcranial-evoked MEP amplitudes from the baseline in both UL and LL stimulation ."
5141,RESULTS,"However , this was not the case for sevoflurane for which even a low concentration at 0.3 MAC significantly depressed MEP amplitudes of LL ( but not UL ) from baseline value ."
5142,RESULTS,"Desflurane at 0.5 and 0.7 MAC depresses LL MEP to 58.4 % and 59.9 % of baseline , respectively ( P < 0.05 ) , whereas sevoflurane at 0.3 , 0.5 , and 0.7 MAC depresses LL MEP to 66.2 % , 41.3 % , and 25.3 % of baseline , respectively ( P < 0.05 ) ."
5143,RESULTS,There was no difference in latency of the responses at any MAC .
5144,CONCLUSIONS,Inhalational anesthetic agents ( sevoflurane > desflurane ) suppress MEP amplitudes in a dose-dependent manner .
5145,CONCLUSIONS,The use of 0.3 MAC of desflurane ( but not sevoflurane ) provided good MEP recordings acceptable for clinical interpretation for both upper and LLs .
5146,CONCLUSIONS,The LL appears to be more sensitive to anesthetic-induced depression compared with the UL .
5147,CONCLUSIONS,"All patients studied had normal neurological examination hence , these results may not be applicable to those with preexisting deficits ."

5435,OBJECTIVE,Emphasizing societal benefits of vaccines has been linked to increased vaccination intentions in adults .
5436,OBJECTIVE,It is unclear if this pattern holds for parents deciding whether to vaccinate their children .
5437,OBJECTIVE,The objective was to determine whether emphasizing the benefits of measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR ) vaccination directly to the vaccine recipient or to society differentially impacts parents ' vaccine intentions for their infants .
5438,METHODS,"In a national online survey , parents ( N = 802 ) of infants < 12 months old were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 MMR vaccine messages : ( 1 ) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Information Statement ( VIS ) , ( 2 ) VIS and information emphasizing the MMR vaccine 's benefits to the child , ( 3 ) VIS and information emphasizing societal benefits , or ( 4 ) VIS and information emphasizing benefits both to the child and society ."
5439,METHODS,Parents reported their likelihood of vaccinating their infants for MMR on a response scale of 0 ( extremely unlikely ) to 100 ( extremely likely ) .
5440,RESULTS,"Compared with the VIS-only group ( mean intention = 86.3 ) , parents reported increased vaccine intentions for their infants when receiving additional information emphasizing the MMR vaccine 's benefits either directly to the child ( mean intention = 91.6 , P = .01 ) or to both the child and society ( mean intention = 90.8 , P = .03 ) ."
5441,RESULTS,"Emphasizing the MMR vaccine 's benefits only to society did not increase intentions ( mean intention = 86.4 , P = .97 ) ."
5442,CONCLUSIONS,We did not see increases in parents ' MMR vaccine intentions for their infants when societal benefits were emphasized without mention of benefits directly to the child .
5443,CONCLUSIONS,This finding suggests that providers should emphasize benefits directly to the child .
5444,CONCLUSIONS,"Mentioning societal benefits seems to neither add value to , nor interfere with , information highlighting benefits directly to the child ."

5526,BACKGROUND,Friction blister research has focused on prevention and treatment approaches rather than exploring the pathophysiology of the friction blister .
5527,BACKGROUND,Increased skin hydration has been purported to be a key risk factor in friction blister development .
5528,BACKGROUND,This study aimed to test the effect of increased skin surface hydration on the risk of friction blister creation .
5529,METHODS,The skin on one foot was hydrated by soaking the foot in water .
5530,METHODS,Intermittent loading was carried out until an observable change of 3C was evident using infrared thermography .
5531,METHODS,The contra lateral foot acted as a control .
5532,METHODS,Skin hydration and elasticity was measured using electrical capacitance and negative pressure respectively .
5533,RESULTS,The rate of temperature change of the hydrated group was significantly greater than that of the non-hydrated foot group ( P = 0.001 ) and showed a strong positive correlation ( r = 0.520 ) with skin surface hydration .
5534,RESULTS,Weak negative correlations were seen between skin elasticity and rate of temperature change in response to load application ( r = -0.166 ) and skin surface hydration and elasticity at baseline ( r = -0.195 ) .
5535,CONCLUSIONS,In controlled experimental conditions increased skin surface hydration increases the rate of temperature change of the skin in response to load application and consequently increases the risk of blister creation .

5545,METHODS,Mixed models were used to analyze response changes over time .
5546,RESULTS,"IO increased fullness ( p = 0.04 ) , suppressed desire to eat ( p = 0.01 ) and reduced prospective intake ( p < 0.01 ) more than the RTEC over four hours , and consistently at the 60minute time-point ."
5547,RESULTS,SO reduced prospective intake ( p = 0.04 ) more than the RTEC .
5548,RESULTS,Hunger scores were not significantly different except that IO reduced hunger more than the RTEC at the 60minute time-point .
5549,RESULTS,"IO and SO had higher - glucan content , molecular weight , gastric viscosity , and larger hydration spheres than the RTEC , and IO had greater viscosity after oral and initial gastric digestion ( initial viscosity ) than the RTEC ."
5550,CONCLUSIONS,IO and SO improved appetite control over four hours compared to RTEC .

5556,METHODS,"Furthermore , rescue time , water aspiration , submersions , and physical exertion were assessed ."
5557,METHODS,"In this randomized cross-over trial , 17 lifeguards performed four rescue maneuvers over a 100-m distance in open water in random order : no ventilation ( NV ) , mouth-to-mouth ventilation ( MMV ) , Oxylator-aided mask ventilation ( OMV ) , and Oxylator-aided laryngeal tube ventilation ( OLTV ) ."
5558,RESULTS,"OLTV resulted in effective ventilation over the entire rescue distance with the highest mean minute volumes ( NV 0 , MMV 2.9 , OMV 4.1 , OLTV 7.6 L min ( -1 ) ) ."
5559,RESULTS,"NV was the fastest rescue maneuver while IWR prolonged the rescue maneuver independently of the method of ventilation ( mean total rescue time : NV 217 , MMV 280 , OMV 292 , OLTV 290 s ) ."
5560,RESULTS,"Aspiration of substantial amounts of water occurred only during MMV ( mean NV 20 , MMV 215 , OMV 15 , OLTV 6 ml ) ."
5561,RESULTS,"NV and OLTV were rated as moderately challenging by the lifeguards , whereas MMV and OMV were rated as substantially demanding on a 0-10 visual analog scale ( NV 5.3 , MMV 7.8 , OMV 7.6 , OLTV 5.9 ) ."
5562,CONCLUSIONS,The device might facilitate IWR by providing effective ventilation with minimal aspiration and by reducing physical effort .
5563,CONCLUSIONS,Another advantage is the possibility of delivering 100 % oxygen .

5841,RESULTS,The number of patients with less frequent seizures ( 3 seizures in the last 3months ) increased in the intervention group ( 62-80 % [ p = 0.002 ] ) and in the nonintervention group ( 67-75 % [ p = 0.04 ] ) .
5842,RESULTS,"Improved therapeutic adherence ( observed in both groups combined ) was positively associated with positive change in beliefs about risks of epilepsy ( relative risk [ RR ] 2.00 , 95 % CI 1.03-3 .95 ) and having nontraditional religious beliefs ( RR 2.01 , 95 % CI 1.01-3 .99 ) ."
5843,RESULTS,"Reduced seizure frequency was associated with improved adherence ( RR 1.72 , 95 % CI 1.19-2 .47 ) ."
5844,RESULTS,"Positive changes in KEBAS were associated with having tertiary education as compared to none ( RR 1.09 , 95 % CI 1.05-1 .14 ) ."
5845,CONCLUSIONS,"Health education improves knowledge about epilepsy , but once only contact does not improve adherence ."
5846,CONCLUSIONS,"However , sustained education may improve adherence in future studies ."
5847,BACKGROUND,"Vaccine effectiveness is usually determined in randomized controlled trials ( RCT ) and if effective , additional information , e.g. on cost-effectiveness , is required to allow evidence-based decision making ."
5848,BACKGROUND,"A prerequisite for proper health economic modelling is the availability of good quality data on health care resources use , health outcomes and quality-of-life ( QoL ) data ."
5849,BACKGROUND,The `` Collecting health outcomes and economic data on hospitalized Community Acquired Pneumonia ( CHO-CAP ) -- a prospective cohort study '' is executed alongside the Community Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial with Adults ( CAPiTA trial ) to capture health outcomes and economic data of elderly hospitalized with CAP and matched controls without CAP .
5850,METHODS,"CAPiTA is a placebo-controlled double-blind RCT evaluating the effectiveness of a 13-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in preventing vaccine-type pneumococcal CAP in 84,496 elderly in the Netherlands ."
5851,METHODS,"Participants of CAPiTA , who consented and provided information on health status ( EQ-5D ) and socio-demographic background at the time of vaccination , constitute the source population of CHO-CAP and are eligible for the nested matched cohort study ."
5852,METHODS,CHO-CAP patients hospitalized with CAP form the `` diseased '' cohort and the `` non-diseased '' cohort consists of unaffected persons ( i.e. no CAP ) .
5853,METHODS,"Observations in the diseased cohort and in matched controls from the non-diseased cohort are used to determine excess costs and QoL changes attributable to CAP.Based on an estimated 2,000 CAPiTA participants being hospitalized with CAP and an assumed CHO-CAP participation rate of 30 % of all CAPiTA participants ( 25,000 ) , 600 CAP episodes are expected among CHO-CAP participants ( the `` diseased '' cohort ) ."
5854,METHODS,"For each patient with CAP , two non-diseased CHO-CAP subjects will be selected from the CHO-CAP cohort , with matching for age , gender and EQ-5D baseline-score ."
5855,METHODS,"Data on healthcare and non-healthcare resources use , quality-of-life ( using EQ-5D and SF-36 questionnaires ) and selected health outcomes will be collected at 0 , 1 , 6 and 12 months after hospitalization for CAP.The CHO-CAP study was approved by the Central Committee on Research involving Human Subjects in the Netherlands ."
5856,CONCLUSIONS,With an expected 600 CAP episodes this study will be one of the biggest prospectively studied cohorts of hospitalized elderly with CAP with regard to resources use and Qol data .
5857,CONCLUSIONS,Strengths of this study further include collection of out-of-pocket costs of patients and productivity losses of both patients and their caregivers and the follow-up period of up to one year post-discharge .
5858,CONCLUSIONS,This study is therefore expected to add more in-depth knowledge on the short and longer term outcomes of pneumonia in elderly .

5869,METHODS,"Secondary end points : time to hemostasis , repeat manual compression , and VCD failure ."
5870,METHODS,An - level of .025 was chosen for primary and secondary comparisons .
5871,RESULTS,"Of the 4524 enrolled patients , 3015 were randomly assigned to a VCD group ( 1509 received intravascular VCD and 1506 received extravascular VCD ) and 1509 patients were randomly assigned to the manual compression group ."
5872,RESULTS,"Before hospital discharge , duplex sonography of the access site was performed in 4231 ( 94 % ) patients ."
5873,RESULTS,"The primary end point was observed in 208 patients ( 6.9 % ) assigned to receive a VCD and 119 patients ( 7.9 % ) assigned to manual compression ( difference , -1.0 % [ 1-sided 97.5 % CI , 0.7 % ] ; P for noninferiority < .001 ) ."
5874,RESULTS,"Time to hemostasis was significantly shorter in patients with VCD ( 1 minute [ interquartile range { IQR } , 0.5-2 .0 ] ) , vs manual compression ( 10 minutes [ IQR , 10-15 ] ; P < .001 ) ."
5875,RESULTS,"Time to hemostasis was significantly shorter among patients with intravascular VCD ( 0.5 minute [ IQR , 0.2-1 .0 ] ) , vs extravascular VCD ( 2.0 minutes [ IQR , 1.0-2 .0 ] ; P < .001 ) and closure device failure was also significantly lower among those with intravascular vs extravascular VCD ( 80 patients [ 5.3 % ] , vs 184 patients [ 12.2 % ] ; P < .001 ) ."
5876,CONCLUSIONS,"In patients undergoing transfemoral coronary angiography , VCDs were noninferior to manual compression in terms of vascular access-site complications and reduced time to hemostasis ."

5881,METHODS,"Participants were randomized to continue 800 mg of darunavir ( DRV800 ) or to 600 mg of darunavir ( DRV600 ) , both once daily ."
5882,METHODS,Treatment failure was defined as two consecutive HIV-1 RNA determinations > 50 copies/mL or discontinuation of study treatment by week 48 .
5883,METHODS,The study was registered at https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu ( trial number 2011-006272-39 ) .
5884,RESULTS,Fifty participants were allocated to each arm .
5885,RESULTS,The mean ( SD ) CD4 + T cell count at baseline was 562 ( 303 ) cells/mm ( 3 ) and HIV-1 RNA had been < 50 copies/mL for a median ( IQR ) of 106.9 ( 43.4-227 .9 ) weeks before enrolment .
5886,RESULTS,"At week 48 no treatment failure had occurred in 45/50 ( 90 % ) DRV600 patients and in 47/50 ( 94 % ) DRV800 patients ( difference -4 % ; 95 % CI lower limit , -12.9 % ) ."
5887,RESULTS,"When only patients with virological data were considered , that endpoint was met by 45/48 ( 94 % ) in the DRV600 arm and 47/49 ( 96 % ) in the DRV800 arm ( difference -2.2 % ; 95 % CI lower limit , -9.6 % ) ."
5888,RESULTS,Darunavir exposure was similar in the two arms .
5889,RESULTS,The average reduction in annual cost per successfully treated DRV600-arm patient was US$ 7273 .
5890,CONCLUSIONS,The efficacy of a darunavir daily dose of 600 mg seemed to be similar to the efficacy of the standard 800 mg dose in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients on triple ART .
5891,CONCLUSIONS,This strategy can potentially translate to substantial savings in the cost of care of HIV-infected patients .
5892,BACKGROUND,The postpartum period can be a challenging time particularly for first-time mothers .
5893,BACKGROUND,This study aimed to assess two different interventions designed to reduce stress in the postpartum among first-time mothers .
5894,METHODS,"Healthy first-time mothers with healthy newborns were recruited from hospitals in Beirut , Lebanon after delivery ."
5895,METHODS,The two interventions were a 20-minute film addressing common stressors in the postpartum period and a 24-hour telephone support hotline .
5896,METHODS,"Participants were randomized to one of four study arms to receive either the postpartum support film , the hotline service , both interventions , or a music CD ( control ) ."
5897,METHODS,Participants were interviewed at eight to twelve weeks postpartum for assessment of levels of stress as measured by the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS-10 ) .
5898,RESULTS,"Of the 632 eligible women , 552 ( 88 % ) agreed to participate in the study ."
5899,RESULTS,"Of those , 452 ( 82 % ) completed the study ."
5900,RESULTS,Mean PSS-10 scores of mothers who received the film alone ( 15.76 ) or the film with the hotline service ( 15.86 ) were significantly lower than that of the control group ( 18.93 ) ( p-value < 0.01 ) .
5901,RESULTS,Among mothers who received the hotline service alone mean PSS-10 score ( 16.98 ) was also significantly lower than that of the control group ( p-value < 0.05 ) .
5902,CONCLUSIONS,Both our postpartum support film and the 24-hour telephone hotline service reduced stress in the postpartum period in first-time mothers .

5905,OBJECTIVE,To examine whether dexmedetomidine reduces the injection pain of propofol and rocuronium and to investigate whether the decrease in injection pain is associated with the known sedative action of dexmedetomidine .
5906,METHODS,"Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical comparison study ."
5907,METHODS,"Patients undergoing general anesthesia with intubation received 40 mg of 1 % lidocaine ( lidocaine group ; n = 28 ) , 0.25 g/kg of dexmedetomidine ( low-dose group ; n = 27 ) , 0.5 g/kg of dexmedetomidine ( subclinical dose group ; n = 28 ) , 1.0 g/kg of dexmedetomidine ( clinical dose group , n = 27 ) , or normal saline ( saline group ; n = 28 ) before anesthetic induction ."
5908,METHODS,"Pain associated with propofol and rocuronium injection was assessed using a 10-point verbal analog scale ( VAS ) and a 4-point withdrawal movement scale , respectively ."
5909,METHODS,"The BIS value was measured 60 seconds after administration of the study drug , and at the time of rocuronium injection and intubation ."
5910,RESULTS,"The overall incidence of withdrawal movements due to rocuronium decreased significantly as the dose of dexmedetomidine increased ( 92.8 % , 85.2 % , 78.6 % , and 51.9 % in the saline , low-dose , subclinical dose , and clinical dose groups , respectively ; P = 0.001 ) ."
5911,RESULTS,There was no significant difference in BIS values among the groups 60 seconds after study drug administration or at the time of rocuronium injection .
5912,CONCLUSIONS,Dexmedetomidine reduced pain associated with rocuronium injection in a dose-dependent manner .
5913,CONCLUSIONS,This effect was not associated with the decrease in BIS value .

5923,RESULTS,"In the Twins cohort , genetic heritability was 14.5 % 4.0 % ( P < .001 ) , and common family environment contributed 81.0 % 4 % ( P < .001 ) to phenotypic variance ."
5924,RESULTS,Probandwise concordance in monozygotic co-twins was 57.9 % 9.5 % compared with 36.4 % 9.3 % in dizygotic co-twins ( P = .11 ) .
5925,RESULTS,"Greater birth weight difference between twins ( P = .01 ) , breast-feeding ( P = .15 ) , and fall birth season ( P = .02 ) were associated with twin discordance in disease status ."
5926,CONCLUSIONS,EoE RRRs are increased 10 - to 64-fold compared with the general population .
5927,CONCLUSIONS,"EoE in relatives is 1.8 % to 2.4 % , depending on relationship and sex ."
5928,CONCLUSIONS,Nuclear-Family heritability appeared to be high ( 72.0 % ) .
5929,CONCLUSIONS,"However , the Twins cohort analysis revealed a powerful role for common environment ( 81.0 % ) compared with additive genetic heritability ( 14.5 % ) ."

5937,METHODS,CSDs where there were concerns about performance ; where a major organisational restructuring was planned or under way ; or where other risk assessment tools were in use.Six CSDs are participating in this study .
5938,METHODS,"Social workers in the experimental arm will receive 2 days training in SAAF together with a range of support materials , and access to limited telephone consultation post-training ."
5939,METHODS,The primary outcome is child maltreatment .
5940,METHODS,This will be assessed using data collected nationally on two key performance indicators : the first is the number of children in a year who have been subject to a second Child Protection Plan ( CPP ) ; the second is the number of re-referrals of children because of related concerns about maltreatment .
5941,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes are : i ) the quality of assessments judged against a schedule of quality criteria and ii ) the relationship between the three assessments required by the structured decision-making tool ( level of harm , risk of ( re ) abuse and prospects for successful intervention ) ."
5942,CONCLUSIONS,This is the first study to examine the effectiveness of SAAF .
5943,CONCLUSIONS,It will contribute to a very limited literature on the contribution that structured decision-making tools can make to improving risk assessment and case planning in child protection and on what is involved in their effective implementation .

6025,BACKGROUND,"Laryngeal mask airways that fit over the laryngeal inlet have been shown to be effective for ventilating newborns at birth and should be considered as an alternative to facemask ventilation or endotracheal intubation among newborns weighing > 2,000 g or delivered 34weeks ' gestation ."
6026,BACKGROUND,A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of supraglottic airways in neonatal resuscitation reported the results of four randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) stating that fewer infants in the group using laryngeal mask airways required endotracheal intubation ( 1.5 % ) compared to the group using face masks ( 12.0 % ) .
6027,BACKGROUND,"However , there were methodological concerns over all the RCTs including the fact that the majority of the operators in the trials were anesthesiologists.Our hypothesis is based on the assumption that ventilating newborns needing positive pressure ventilation with a laryngeal mask airway will be more effective than ventilating with a face mask in a setting where neonatal resuscitation is performed by midwives , nurses , and pediatricians ."
6028,BACKGROUND,The primary aim of this study will be to assess the effectiveness of the laryngeal mask airway over the face mask in preventing the need for endotracheal intubation .
6029,METHODS,"This will be an open , prospective , randomized , single center , clinical trial ."
6030,METHODS,"In this study , 142 newborns weighing > 1,500 g or delivered 34weeks gestation needing positive pressure ventilation at birth will be randomized to be ventilated with a laryngeal mask airway ( LMA SupremeTM , LMA Company , UK - intervention group ) or with a face mask ( control group ) ."
6031,METHODS,Proportion of newborns needing endotracheal intubation .
6032,RESULTS,"Apgar score at 5minutes , time to first breath , onset of the first cry , duration of resuscitation , death or moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy within 7days of life ."
6033,BACKGROUND,"ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT01963936 ( October 11 , 2013 ) ."
6034,BACKGROUND,"Hypertonic citrate adenine ( HC-A ) solution , containing citrate and adenine , has become the most widely used preservation solution in isolated kidney preservation in China ."
6035,BACKGROUND,More than 30 years of clinical application has demonstrated that HC-A is safe and effective .
6036,BACKGROUND,"With higher requirement for kidney preservation and less tolerance of preservation-related graft dysfunction , a new solution , HC-A II , for kidney preservation was developed by Shanghai Changzheng Hospital ."
6037,METHODS,"Upon approval from the State Food and Drug Administration of China ( SFDA ) , a multi-center randomized controlled trial was performed to study the efficacy and safety of HC-A II in kidney preservation from 2008 to 2012 , using histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution ( HTK ) as control ( HC-A , n = 137 , and HTK , n = 140 ) ."
6038,METHODS,There were no differences with regard to donor and recipient demographics or cold ischemia .
6039,RESULTS,"The trial results showed no significant difference in DGF rate , or patient or graft survival between the 2 groups ."
6040,RESULTS,"No significant difference between the 2 groups was found in the percentage of patients whose serum creatinine ( SCr ) test results returned to normal within 28 days ( P > 0.05 ) , nor were there a significant difference in safety evaluation ( P > 0.05 ) ."
6041,CONCLUSIONS,HC-A II and HTK appear to have similar efficacy in isolated kidney preservation .
6042,OBJECTIVE,Prevention research has to elucidate how families with overweight children can be convinced to participate in obesity intervention trials .
6043,OBJECTIVE,"Here we describe the detailed recruitment process for a telephone-based obesity prevention programme for families with overweight children and present participation rates , the study design and a socio-demographic description of participating families ."
6044,METHODS,Overweight ( BMI > 90th percentile ) children and adolescents 4-17 years of age were screened via the German paediatrician network CrescNet .
6045,METHODS,The prevention programme ( multiple computer aided telephone counselling interviews ) was suggested to eligible families via local paediatricians .
6046,METHODS,"Participating families were compared anthropometrically and socio-demographically to the entire screening population and to micro-census data , a representative national survey ."
6047,RESULTS,The screening process assessed 4005 candidates for eligibility .
6048,RESULTS,Paediatricians reported having suggested programme participation to 3387 candidates ( referred to as 100 % ) .
6049,RESULTS,427 candidates ( 12.6 % ) returned a written consent for programme participation .
6050,RESULTS,303 candidates ( 9.0 % ) started the intervention .
6051,RESULTS,The study population ( n = 303 ) included more obese ( 45.6 % vs. 33.2 % ; p < 0.001 ) and fewer overweight participants ( 40.4 % vs. 55.2 % ; p < 0.001 ) than the entire screening population .
6052,RESULTS,"Compared to the micro-census , families with adolescents ( 8.2 % vs. 16.9 % ; p < 0.001 ) and single parents ( 16.0 % vs. 23.3 % ; p < 0.005 ) were underrepresented in the study population , whereas families living in rural areas were overrepresented ( 58.7 % vs. 50.2 % ; p < 0.005 ) ."
6053,CONCLUSIONS,"Although 84.6 % of the paediatricians forwarded the suggestion for programme participation to eligible families , participation rates for this low-threshold ; telephone-based obesity intervention remained very low ."
6054,CONCLUSIONS,"`` Hard-to-engage groups '' for effective obesity prevention seem to include single parents , as well as parents of adolescents ."

6063,METHODS,Recoveries were videotaped and scored by two observers blinded to the treatment .
6064,METHODS,Data were analyzed using repeated measures anova followed by Dunnett 's or Bonferroni 's significant difference test .
6065,METHODS,Recovery scores were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis test .
6066,RESULTS,No significant differences were found among groups .
6067,RESULTS,"Compared to baseline , heart rate decreased and SVR increased significantly in all groups , and cardiac index significantly decreased in groups S and M. Hemoglobin concentration , oxygen content and oxygen delivery significantly decreased in all groups ."
6068,RESULTS,The oxygen extraction ratio significantly increased in groups M and R. Lactate concentration significantly increased in group S. Recovery scores were similar among groups .
6069,CONCLUSIONS,Dexmedetomidine alone or in combination with remifentanil or morphine infusions was infused for 60 minutes without adverse effects in the 6 healthy isoflurane-anesthetized horses in this study .
6070,OBJECTIVE,"It is well established through randomized trials that oral antibiotics given with or without a mechanical bowel preparation ( MBP ) prior to colorectal procedures reduce complications , while MBP given alone provides no benefit ."
6071,OBJECTIVE,We aimed to characterize trends surrounding bowel preparation in children and determine whether contemporary practice is evidence-based .
6072,METHODS,Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing colorectal procedures at 42 children 's hospitals ( 1/2/2007 -12 / 31/2011 ) was performed .
6073,METHODS,"Patients were analyzed for diagnosis , pre-admission status , and inpatient bowel preparation ."
6074,METHODS,Bowel preparation was considered evidence-based if oral antibiotics were utilized with or without a MBP .
6075,RESULTS,"49 % of all patients were pre-admitted ( n = 5,473 ) , and the most common diagnoses were anorectal malformations ( 55 % ) , inflammatory bowel disease ( 26 % ) , and Hirschsprung 's Disease ( 19 % ) ."
6076,RESULTS,"The most common preparation approaches were MBP alone ( 54.3 % ) , MBP + oral antibiotics ( 18.8 % ) , and oral antibiotics alone ( 4.2 % ) , although significant variation was found in hospital-specific rates for each approach ( MBP alone : 0-96 .1 % , MBP + oral antibiotics : 0-83 .6 % , orals alone : 0-91 .6 % , p < 0.0001 ) ."
6077,RESULTS,"Only 22.9 % of all patients received an evidence-based preparation ( range by hospital : 0-92 .3 % , p < 0.0001 ) , and this rate decreased significantly during the five-year study period ( 27.6 % in 2007 vs. 17.3 % in 2011 , p < 0.0001 ) ."
6078,CONCLUSIONS,"According to the best available clinical evidence , less than a quarter of all children pre-admitted for elective colorectal procedures receive a bowel preparation proven to reduce infectious complications ."
6079,OBJECTIVE,To assess the effects of short-term resistance training and pulsed electromagnetic fields on bone metabolism and joint function in patients with haemophilia with osteoporosis .
6080,METHODS,"A randomized , controlled , patient and blood sample assessor-blinded , six-week trial , three times weekly ."
6081,METHODS,Hospital outpatients with severe haemophilia A and osteoporosis .
6082,METHODS,"Forty-eight patients were randomly assigned to resistance training ( RT , n = 13 ) , combined resistance training with pulsed electromagnetic fields ( RTPEMF , n = 12 ) , pulsed electromagnetic fields ( PEMF , n = 11 ) and control ( n = 12 ) groups ."
6083,METHODS,The RT group received 30-40 minutes of resistance exercises and placebo pulsed electromagnetic fields .
6084,METHODS,The RTPEMF group received the same exercises with lower repetition and 30 minutes of pulsed electromagnetic fields .

6091,BACKGROUND,This study compares the long-term results of pneumatic dilatations versus laparoscopic myotomy using treatment failure as the primary outcome .
6092,BACKGROUND,"The frequency and degree of dysphagia , the effects on quality of life ( QoL ) , and health economy were also examined ."
6093,METHODS,Fifty-three patients with achalasia were randomized to laparoscopic myotomy with a posterior partial fundoplication [ laparoscopic myotomy ( LM ) n = 25 ] or repetitive pneumatic dilatation [ pneumatic dilatation ( PD ) n = 28 ] .
6094,METHODS,The median observation period was 81.5 months ( range 12-131 ) .
6095,RESULTS,"At the minimal follow-up of 5 years , ten patients ( 36 % ) in the dilatation group and two patients ( 8 % ) in the myotomy group , including two patients lost to follow-up ( one in each arm ) , were classified as failures ( p = 0.016 ) ."
6096,RESULTS,The cumulative incidence of treatment failures was analyzed by survival statistics .
6097,RESULTS,"Taking the entire follow-up period into account , a significant difference was observed in favor of the LM strategy ( p = 0.02 ) ."
6098,RESULTS,"Although both treatments resulted in significant improvements in dysphagia scores , LM was significantly favored over PD after 1 and 3 years , but not after 5 years ."
6099,RESULTS,"Health-related QoL assessed by the personal general well being score was higher in the LM group after 3 years , but the difference was not fully statistically significant at 5 years ."
6100,RESULTS,"Direct medical costs during the entire follow-up period were in median $ 13,421 for LM as compared to $ 5,558 for PD ( p = 0.001 ) ."
6101,CONCLUSIONS,"This long-term follow-up of a randomized clinical study shows that LM is superior to repetitive PD treatment of newly diagnosed achalasia , albeit that this surgical strategy is burdened by high initial direct medical costs ."
6102,CONCLUSIONS,www.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 02086669 .
6103,BACKGROUND,"Individual barriers to weight loss and physical activity goals in the Diabetes Prevention Program , a randomized trial with 3.2 years average treatment duration , have not been previously reported ."
6104,BACKGROUND,"Evaluating barriers and the lifestyle coaching approaches used to improve adherence in a large , diverse participant cohort can inform dissemination efforts ."
6105,METHODS,Lifestyle coaches documented barriers and approaches after each session ( mean session attendance = 50.321.8 ) .
6106,METHODS,"Subjects were 1076 intensive lifestyle participants ( mean age = 50.6 years ; mean BMI = 33.9 kg/m ; 68 % female , 48 % non-Caucasian ) ."
6107,METHODS,Barriers and approaches used to improve adherence were ranked by the percentage of the cohort for whom they applied .
6108,METHODS,Barrier groupings were also analyzed in relation to baseline demographic characteristics .
6109,RESULTS,Top weight loss barriers reported were problems with self-monitoring ( 58 % ) ; social cues ( 58 % ) ; holidays ( 54 % ) ; low activity ( 48 % ) ; and internal cues ( thought/mood ) ( 44 % ) .
6110,RESULTS,"Top activity barriers were holidays ( 51 % ) ; time management ( 50 % ) ; internal cues ( 30 % ) ; illness ( 29 % ) , and motivation ( 26 % ) ."
6111,RESULTS,The percentage of the cohort having any type of barrier increased over the long-term intervention period .
6112,RESULTS,"A majority of the weight loss barriers were significantly associated with younger age , greater obesity , and non-Caucasian race/ethnicity ( p-values vary ) ."
6113,RESULTS,"Physical activity barriers , particularly thought and mood cues , social cues and time management , physical injury or illness and access/weather , were most significantly associated with being female and obese ( p < 0.001 for all ) ."
6114,RESULTS,Lifestyle coaches used problem-solving with most participants ( 75 % short-term ; > 90 % long term ) and regularly reviewed self-monitoring skills .
6115,RESULTS,More costly approaches were used infrequently during the first 16 sessions ( 10 % ) but increased over 3.2 years .
6116,CONCLUSIONS,Behavioral problem solving approaches have short and long term dissemination potential for many kinds of participant barriers .
6117,CONCLUSIONS,"Given minimal resources , increased attention to training lifestyle coaches in the consistent use of these approaches appears warranted ."
6118,BACKGROUND,"Lack of universal , annual testing for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) in health facilities suggests that expansion of HIV testing and counselling ( HTC ) to non-clinical settings is critical to the achievement of national goals for prevention , care and treatment ."
6119,BACKGROUND,Consideration should be given to the ability of lay counsellors to perform home-based HTC in community settings .
6120,METHODS,"We implemented a community cluster randomized controlled trial of home-based HTC in Sisonke District , South Africa ."
6121,METHODS,Trained lay counsellors conducted door-to-door HIV testing using the same rapid tests used by the local health department at the time of the study ( SD Bioline and Sensa ) .
6122,METHODS,"To monitor testing quality and counsellor skill , additional dry blood spots were taken and sent for laboratory-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) testing ."
6123,METHODS,Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the laboratory result as the gold standard .
6124,CONCLUSIONS,"From 3986 samples , the counsellor and laboratory results matched in all but 23 cases ."
6125,CONCLUSIONS,"In 18 cases , the counsellor judged the result as indeterminate , whereas the laboratory judged 10 positive , eight negative and three indeterminate , indicating that the counsellor may have erred on the side of caution ."
6126,CONCLUSIONS,"Sensitivity was 98.0 % ( 95 % CI : 96.3-98 .9 % ) , and specificity 99.6 % ( 95 % CI : 99.4-99 .7 % ) , for the lay counsellor field-based rapid tests ."
6127,CONCLUSIONS,"Both measures are high , and the lower confidence bound for specificity meets the international standard for assessing HIV rapid tests ."
6128,CONCLUSIONS,These findings indicate that adequately trained lay counsellors are capable of safely conducting high-quality rapid HIV tests and interpreting the results as per the kit guidelines .
6129,CONCLUSIONS,These findings are important given the likely expansion of community and home-based testing models and the shortage of clinically trained professional staff .

6144,BACKGROUND,The consumption of citrus fruits is associated with health benefits .
6145,BACKGROUND,"However , clinical data regarding the effects of grapefruit flavanone consumption on vascular function are lacking ."
6146,OBJECTIVE,The objective of the present study was to address the role of flavanones in the long-term effects induced by grapefruit juice ( GFJ ) consumption on vascular function in healthy postmenopausal women .
6147,METHODS,"Forty-eight healthy postmenopausal women aged 50-65 y within 3-10 y since menopause , a body mass index ( in kg/m ( 2 ) ) of 19-30 , and a waist size > 88 cm completed this double-blind , randomized , controlled , crossover trial ."
6148,METHODS,"These volunteers were randomly assigned to consume 340 mL GFJ/d , providing 210 mg naringenin glycosides , or a matched control drink without flavanones for 6 mo each , with a 2-mo washout between beverages ."
6149,METHODS,The primary endpoint was the assessment of endothelial function in the brachial artery by using flow-mediated dilation .
6150,METHODS,"Blood pressure , arterial stiffness , and endothelial function in the peripheral arterial bed were also evaluated as indicators of vascular function ."
6151,METHODS,These measurements and blood collection for clinical biochemical markers were performed in overnight-fasted subjects before and after the 6-mo treatment periods .
6152,RESULTS,"The mean SD carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity , which reflects central aortic stiffness , was statistically significantly lower after consumption of GFJ ( 7.36 1.15 m/s ) than after consumption of the matched control drink without flavanones ( 7.70 1.36 m/s ) , with a P value of 0.019 for the treatment effect ."
6153,RESULTS,"Endothelial function in macro - and microcirculation , blood pressure , anthropometric measures , glucose metabolism , and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress were not affected by the intervention ."
6154,CONCLUSIONS,"Regular GFJ consumption by middle-aged , healthy postmenopausal women is beneficial for arterial stiffness ."
6155,CONCLUSIONS,This effect may be related to flavanones present in grapefruit .
6156,CONCLUSIONS,This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01272167 .
6157,OBJECTIVE,"Compare public perceptions and intentions to undergo colorectal cancer screening tests following detailed information regarding CT colonography ( CTC ; after non-laxative preparation or full-laxative preparation ) , optical colonoscopy ( OC ) or flexible sigmoidoscopy ( FS ) ."
6158,METHODS,"A total of 3,100 invitees approaching screening age ( 45-54 years ) were randomly allocated to receive detailed information on a single test and asked to return a questionnaire ."
6159,METHODS,"Outcomes included perceptions of preparation and test tolerability , health benefits , sensitivity and specificity , and intention to undergo the test ."
6160,RESULTS,Six hundred three invitees responded with valid questionnaire data .
6161,RESULTS,Non-laxative preparation was rated more positively than enema or full-laxative preparations [ effect size ( r ) = 0.13 to 0.54 ; p < 0.0005 to 0.036 ] ; both forms of CTC and FS were rated more positively than OC in terms of test experience ( r = 0.26 to 0.28 ; all p-values < 0.0005 ) .
6162,RESULTS,"Perceptions of health benefits , sensitivity and specificity ( p = 0.250 to 0.901 ) , and intention to undergo the test ( p = 0.213 ) did not differ between tests ( n = 144-155 for each test ) ."
6163,CONCLUSIONS,"Despite non-laxative CTC being rated more favourably , this study did not find evidence that offering it would lead to substantially higher uptake than full-laxative CTC or other methods ."
6164,CONCLUSIONS,"However , this study was limited by a lower than anticipated response rate ."
6165,CONCLUSIONS,Improving uptake of colorectal cancer screening tests could improve health benefits Potential invitees rate CTC and flexible sigmoidoscopy more positively than colonoscopy Non-laxative bowel preparation is rated better than enema or full-laxative preparations These positive perceptions alone may not be sufficient to improve uptake Health benefits and accuracy are rated similarly for preventative screening tests .
6166,OBJECTIVE,To describe the incidence and outcomes of reoperations for glaucoma in the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy ( TVT ) Study .
6167,METHODS,Cohort study of patients in a multicenter randomized clinical trial .
6168,METHODS,The TVT Study enrolled 212 patients with medically uncontrolled glaucoma who had previous cataract and/or glaucoma surgery .
6169,METHODS,Randomization assigned 107 patients to surgery with a tube shunt ( 350 mm ( 2 ) Baerveldt glaucoma implant ) and 105 patients to trabeculectomy with mitomycin C ( 0.4 mg/mL for 4 minutes ) .
6170,METHODS,Data were analyzed from patients who failed their assigned treatment and had additional glaucoma surgery .
6171,METHODS,"Outcome measures included intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , use of glaucoma medications , visual acuity , surgical complications , and failure ( IOP > 21 mm Hg or not reduced by 20 % , IOP 5 mm Hg , additional glaucoma surgery , or loss of light perception vision ) ."
6172,RESULTS,"Additional glaucoma surgery was performed in 8 patients in the tube group and 18 patients in the trabeculectomy group in the TVT Study , and the 5-year cumulative reoperation rate was 9 % in the tube group and 29 % in the trabeculectomy group ( P = .025 ) ."
6173,RESULTS,Follow-up ( mean SD ) after additional glaucoma surgery was 28.0 16.0 months in the tube group and 30.5 20.4 months in the trabeculectomy group ( P = .76 ) .
6174,RESULTS,"At 2 years after a glaucoma reoperation , IOP ( mean SD ) was 15.0 5.5 mm Hg in the tube group and 14.4 6.6 mm Hg in the trabeculectomy group ( P = .84 ) ."
6175,RESULTS,The number of glaucoma medications ( mean SD ) after 2 years of follow-up was 1.1 1.3 in the tube group and 1.4 1.4 in the trabeculectomy group ( P = .71 ) .
6176,RESULTS,"The cumulative probability of failure at 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 years after additional glaucoma surgery was 0 % , 43 % , 43 % , and 43 % , respectively , in the tube group , and 0 % , 9 % , 20 % , and 47 % in the trabeculectomy group ( P = .28 ) ."
6177,RESULTS,Reoperations to manage complications were required in 1 patient in the tube group and 5 patients in the trabeculectomy group ( P = .63 ) .
6178,CONCLUSIONS,The rate of reoperation for glaucoma was higher following trabeculectomy with mitomycin C than tube shunt surgery in the TVT Study .
6179,CONCLUSIONS,"Similar surgical outcomes were observed after additional glaucoma surgery , irrespective of initial randomized treatment in the study ."
6180,BACKGROUND,Blockade of platelet activation and aggregation can inhibit metastasis in preclinical models and is associated with cancer prevention .
6181,BACKGROUND,"To test whether disruption of platelet function with clopidogrel and aspirin would decrease the number of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) in patients with metastatic breast cancer , a randomized phase II study was performed ."
6182,METHODS,Patients with metastatic breast cancer who were not currently receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy were eligible .
6183,METHODS,Patients were randomized to receive either clopidogrel and aspirin or to a control group receiving no treatment .
6184,METHODS,"Phlebotomy was performed at baseline , at 2 and 4 weeks , and monthly thereafter to obtain specimens to assess CTC , platelet aggregation , and thrombin activity ."
6185,METHODS,The primary end point was the proportion of patients with detectable CTCs at 1 month .
6186,RESULTS,Forty-eight patients were enrolled and 42 were evaluable at 1month .
6187,RESULTS,Baseline CTC numbers were 5 in 13 % and 1 in 65 % of patients .
6188,RESULTS,"Despite adequate platelet function inhibition in the treatment group , the proportion of patients with detectable CTCs was similar between the clopidogrel/aspirin and control groups at baseline ( P = .21 ) and 4 weeks ( P = .75 ) , showing no treatment effect ."
6189,RESULTS,Measured endogenous thrombin potential did not correlate with CTC number .
6190,RESULTS,No bleeding-related serious adverse events ( SAEs ) occurred .
6191,CONCLUSIONS,"The baseline CTC numbers were lower than expected , decreasing the ability to detect an impact of platelet inhibition on CTCs ."
6192,CONCLUSIONS,Clopidogrel and aspirin were well tolerated .
6193,CONCLUSIONS,"Future studies evaluating the potential therapeutic role of antiplatelet therapy in breast cancer remain of interest , and they may be informed by theseresults ."
6194,OBJECTIVE,The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial was completed with a low stroke and death rate .
6195,OBJECTIVE,"A lead-in series of patients receiving carotid artery stenting was used to select the physician-operators for the study , where performance was evaluated by complication rates and by peer review of cases ."
6196,OBJECTIVE,"Herein , we assess the potential contribution of statistical evaluation of complication rates ."
6197,METHODS,"The ability to discriminate between stent operators who can successfully meet the published guideline of < 3 % combined rate of stroke and death is calculated under the binomial distribution , based on a small consecutive case series ( n = 24 patients ) ."
6198,RESULTS,A criterion of 2 stroke or death events among the 24 patients ( < 8 % event rate ) was required of operators .
6199,RESULTS,"Setting such a high criterion , however , ensures an inability to exclude operators who can not meet the criteria ."
6200,RESULTS,"In fact , if a good operator is defined as having a 2 % event rate and a poor operator as a 6 % event rate , even a series of 240 patients would ( on average ) still exclude 5.4 % of the good operators and include 4.6 % of the poor operators ."
6201,CONCLUSIONS,The low periprocedural event rates in the trial suggest success in separating skillful operators from less skillful .
6202,CONCLUSIONS,"However , it seems unlikely that statistical assessment of event rates in the lead-in contributed to successful selection , but rather successful selection was more likely because of peer review of subjective and other factors including patient volume and technical approaches ."

6204,BACKGROUND,Unique identifier : NCT00004732 .
6205,OBJECTIVE,"The objective of the study was to compare long-term results of subtotal vs total abdominal hysterectomy for benign uterine diseases 14 years after hysterectomy , with urinary incontinence as the primary outcome measure ."
6206,METHODS,"This was a long-term follow-up of a multicenter , randomized clinical trial without blinding ."
6207,METHODS,Eleven gynecological departments in Denmark contributed participants to the trial .
6208,METHODS,Women referred for benign uterine diseases who did not have contraindications to subtotal abdominal hysterectomy were randomized to subtotal ( n = 161 ) vs total ( n = 158 ) abdominal hysterectomy .
6209,METHODS,All women enrolled in the trial from 1996 to 2000 who were still alive and living in Denmark ( n = 304 ) were invited to answer the validated questionnaire used in prior 1 and 5 year follow-ups .
6210,METHODS,Hospital contacts possibly related to hysterectomy from 5 to 14 years postoperatively were registered from discharge summaries from all public hospitals in Denmark .
6211,METHODS,The results were analyzed as intention to treat and per protocol .
6212,METHODS,Possible bias caused by missing data was handled by multiple imputation .
6213,METHODS,"The primary outcome was urinary incontinence ; the secondary outcomes were pelvic organ prolapse , constipation , pain , sexuality , quality of life ( Short Form-36 questionnaire ) , hospital contacts , and vaginal bleeding ."
6214,RESULTS,The questionnaire was answered by 197 of 304 women ( 64.8 % ) ( subtotal hysterectomy [ n = 97 ] [ 63.4 % ] ; total hysterectomy [ n = 100 ] [ 66.2 % ] ) .
6215,RESULTS,Mean follow-up time was 14 years and mean age at follow-up was 60.1 years .
6216,RESULTS,"After subtotal abdominal hysterectomy , 32 of 97 women ( 33 % ) complained of urinary incontinence compared with 20 of 100 women ( 20 % ) after total abdominal hysterectomy 14 years after hysterectomy ( relative risk , 1.67 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.02-2 .70 ; P = .035 ) ."
6217,RESULTS,"After a multiple imputation analysis , this difference disappeared ( relative risk , 1.36 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.86-2 .13 ; P = .19 ) ."
6218,RESULTS,No differences were seen in any of the secondary outcomes .
6219,CONCLUSIONS,Subtotal abdominal hysterectomy was not superior to total abdominal hysterectomy on any outcomes .
6220,CONCLUSIONS,More women seem to have subjective urinary incontinence 14 years after subtotal abdominal hysterectomy .
6221,CONCLUSIONS,This result was not confirmed by multiple imputation analysis and should be interpreted cautiously .
6222,BACKGROUND,"Enterococci , the second leading cause of health care-associated infections , have evolved from commensal and harmless organisms to multidrug-resistant bacteria associated with a significant increase in patient morbidity and mortality ."
6223,BACKGROUND,Prevention of ongoing spread of this organism within and between hospitals is important .
6224,BACKGROUND,"In this study , we characterized Enterococcus transmission dynamics for bacterial reservoirs commonly encountered by anesthesia providers during the routine administration of general anesthesia ."
6225,METHODS,"Enterococcus isolates previously obtained from bacterial reservoirs frequently encountered by anesthesiologists ( patient nasopharynx and axilla , anesthesia provider hands , and the adjustable pressure-limiting valve and agent dial of the anesthesia machine ) at 3 major academic medical centers were identified as possible intraoperative bacterial transmission events by class of pathogen , temporal association , and phenotypic analysis ( analytical profile indexing ) ."
6226,METHODS,They were then subjected to antibiotic disk diffusion sensitivity for transmission event confirmation .
6227,METHODS,"Isolates involved in confirmed transmission events were further analyzed to characterize the frequency , mode , origin , location of transmission events , and antibiotic susceptibility of transmitted pathogens ."
6228,RESULTS,Three hundred eighty-nine anesthesia reservoir isolates were previously identified by gross morphology and simple rapid tests as Enterococcus .
6229,RESULTS,The combination of further analytical profile indexing analysis and temporal association implicated 43 % ( 166/389 ) of those isolates in possible intraoperative bacterial transmission events .
6230,RESULTS,"Approximately , 30 % ( 49/166 ) of possible transmission events were confirmed by additional antibiotic disk diffusion analysis ."
6231,RESULTS,"Two phenotypes , E5 and E7 , explained 80 % ( 39/49 ) of confirmed transmission events ."
6232,RESULTS,"For both phenotypes , provider hands were a common reservoir of origin proximal to the transmission event ( 96 % [ 72/75 ] hand origin for E7 and 89 % [ 50/56 ] hand origin for E5 ) and site of transmission ( 94 % [ 16/17 ] hand transmission location for E7 and 86 % [ 19/22 ] hand transmission location for E5 ) ."
6233,CONCLUSIONS,Anesthesia provider hand contamination is a common proximal source and transmission location for Enterococcus transmission events in the anesthesia work area .
6234,CONCLUSIONS,Future work should evaluate the impact of intraoperative hand hygiene improvement strategies on the dynamics of intraoperative Enterococcus transmission .
6235,OBJECTIVE,"To describe quantitative and qualitative features of eyes with advanced bullous keratopathy assessed using ultrasound biomicroscopy , before and after anterior stromal puncture ( ASP ) or amniotic membrane transplantation ( AMT ) procedures to relieve chronic pain ."
6236,METHODS,The present descriptive comparative study included 40 eyes of 40 patients with chronic intermittent pain due to bullous keratopathy who were randomly assigned to one of the two treatments ( AMT or ASP ) .
6237,METHODS,"Ultrasound biomicroscopy ( Humphrey , UBM 840 , 50 MHz transducer , immersion technique ) was used , and a questionnaire about pain intensity was completed preoperatively and postoperatively at days 90 and 180 , respectively ."
6238,METHODS,"Exclusion criteria were age < 18 years , presence of concurrent infection , ocular hypertension , and absence of pain ."
6239,RESULTS,"In a 180-day follow-up , the AMT group exhibited mean central corneal thickness ( CCT ) , 899.4 m preoperatively and 1122.5 m postoperatively ( p < 0.001 ) ; mean epithelial thickness ( ET ) , 156.4 m preoperatively and 247.8 m postoperatively ( p < 0.001 ) ; and mean stromal thickness ( ST ) , 742.9 m preoperatively and 826.3 m postoperatively ( p = 0.005 ) ."
6240,RESULTS,"The ASP group exhibited mean CCT , 756.7 m preoperatively and 914.8 m postoperatively ( p < 0.001 ) ; mean ET , 102.1 m preoperatively and 245.2 m postoperatively ( p < 0.001 ) ; and mean ST , 654.6 m preoperatively and 681.5 m postoperatively ( p < 0.999 ) ."
6241,RESULTS,Correlations between CCT and pain intensity in the AMT group ( p = 0.209 pre - and postoperatively ) and the ASP group ( p = 0.157 preoperatively and p = 0.426 at the 180-day follow-up ) were not statistically significant .
6242,RESULTS,"Epithelial and stromal edema , Descemet 's membrane folds , epithelial bullae , and the presence of interface fluid were frequently observed qualitative features ."
6243,CONCLUSIONS,CCT increased over time in both groups .
6244,CONCLUSIONS,The magnitude of CCT did not correlate with pain intensity in the sample studied .
6245,CONCLUSIONS,The presence of interface fluid was a qualitative feature specifically found in some patients who underwent AMT .
6246,OBJECTIVE,"The association between low birthweight ( LBW ) and risk of developing type 2 diabetes may involve epigenetic mechanisms , with skeletal muscle being a prime target tissue ."
6247,OBJECTIVE,"Differential DNA methylation patterns have been observed in single genes in muscle tissue from type 2 diabetic and LBW individuals , and we recently showed multiple DNA methylation changes during short-term high-fat overfeeding in muscle of healthy people ."
6248,OBJECTIVE,"In a randomised crossover study , we analysed genome-wide DNA promoter methylation in skeletal muscle of 17 young LBW men and 23 matched normal birthweight ( NBW ) men after a control and a 5 day high-fat overfeeding diet ."
6249,METHODS,"DNA methylation was measured using Illumina 's Infinium BeadArray covering 27,578 CpG sites representing 14,475 different genes ."
6250,RESULTS,"After correction for multiple comparisons , DNA methylation levels were found to be similar in the LBW and NBW groups during the control diet ."
6251,RESULTS,"Whereas widespread DNA methylation changes were observed in the NBW group in response to high-fat overfeeding , only a few methylation changes were seen in the LBW group ( ( 2 ) , p < 0.001 ) ."
6252,CONCLUSIONS,"Our results indicate lower DNA methylation plasticity in skeletal muscle from LBW vs NBW men , potentially contributing to understanding the link between LBW and increased risk of type 2 diabetes ."

6257,METHODS,"Patients received up to four 3-month courses of UPA 10 mg daily , immediately followed by 10-day double-blind treatment with NETA ( 10 mg daily ) or placebo ."
6258,METHODS,"Amenorrhea , fibroid volume , endometrial histology ."
6259,RESULTS,"After the first UPA course , amenorrhea occurred in 79 % of women , with median onset ( from treatment start ) of 4 days ( interquartile range , 2-6 days ) ."
6260,RESULTS,"Median fibroid volume change was -45 % ( interquartile range , -66 % ; -25 % ) ."
6261,RESULTS,"Amenorrhea rates were 89 % , 88 % , and 90 % for the 131 , 119 , and 107 women who received treatment courses 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively ."
6262,RESULTS,"Median times to amenorrhea were 2 , 3 , and 3 days for treatment courses 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively ."

6272,RESULTS,"The prevalence of MetS was 49.8 % in the overall sample ( 83.2 % of those with diabetes mellitus , 38.1 % of those without ) ."
6273,RESULTS,"MetS was associated with stronger grip strength ( mean difference ( ) = 1.2 kg , P = .01 ) in the overall sample and in participants without diabetes mellitus and with poorer self-rated health ( = 0.1 kg , P < .001 ) in the overall sample only ."
6274,RESULTS,"No significant differences were found in 400-m walk time , SPPB score , or disability score between participants with and without MetS , in the overall sample or diabetes mellitus subgroups ."
6275,CONCLUSIONS,"Metabolic dysfunction is highly prevalent in older adults at risk of mobility disability , yet consistent associations were not observed between MetS and walking speed , lower extremity function , or self-reported disability after adjusting for known and potential confounders ."
6276,CONCLUSIONS,Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate whether MetS accelerates declines in functional status in high-risk older adults and to inform clinical and public health interventions aimed at preventing or delaying disability in this group .

6293,OBJECTIVE,To understand whether using oral contraceptive pills ( OCPs ) results in temporary interruption of bleeding for etonogestrel contraceptive implant users during a 14-day course .
6294,METHODS,"In this double-blind trial , we randomly assigned etonogestrel implant users reporting 7 consecutive days or more of bothersome bleeding to receive 14 pills of study drug ( 150 microgram levonorgestrel and 30 microgram ethinyl estradiol combined OCPs ) or an identical-appearing placebo ."
6295,METHODS,The primary outcome was the proportion of women in each group who stopped bleeding during therapy and continued to report no bleeding at the end of therapy .
6296,METHODS,"Prespecified secondary outcomes were number of days until temporary interruption of bleeding occurred , number of days without bleeding during therapy , and number of days to recurrence of bleeding after discontinuation of therapy ."

6306,OBJECTIVE,Examine longitudinal associations between sources of social support and social undermining for healthy eating and physical activity and weight change .
6307,METHODS,Data are from 633 employed adults participating in a cluster-randomized multilevel weight gain prevention intervention .
6308,METHODS,"Primary predictors included social support and social undermining for two types of behaviors ( healthy eating and physical activity ) from three sources ( family , friends , and coworkers ) obtained via self-administered surveys ."
6309,METHODS,The primary outcome ( weight in kg ) was measured by trained staff .

6316,OBJECTIVE,We assessed the impact of hot flashes and various forms of hormone therapy on health-related quality of life and sexual well-being in recently postmenopausal women .
6317,METHODS,"We prospectively interviewed 150 healthy women about hot flashes and health-related quality of life ( using the Women 's Health Questionnaire and the McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire ) , menopause-related symptoms , and general health ."
6318,METHODS,"The women were classified into those with ( n = 72 ) and without ( n = 78 ) hot flashes and treated for 6 months with transdermal estradiol ( 1 mg/d ) , oral estradiol ( 2 mg/d ) with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate ( 5 mg/d ) , or placebo ."
6319,RESULTS,"At baseline , hot flashes contributed most strongly to poor sleep ( correlation coefficient r = -0.525 , P < 0.0001 ) , somatic symptoms such as muscle pains ( r = -0.348 , P < 0.0001 ) , menstrual cycle-resembling complaints ( r = -0.304 , P < 0.0001 ) , anxiety and fears ( r = -0.283 , P < 0.0001 ) , decreased memory and concentration ( r = -0.279 , P = 0.001 ) , and sexual behavior ( r = -0.174 , P = 0.035 ) ."
6320,RESULTS,The different hormone therapy regimens alleviated hot flashes equally effectively and were therefore combined into a single group for further analysis .
6321,RESULTS,"In women with baseline flashes , hormone therapy use significantly improved the scores for sleep ( 0.787 [ 0.243 ] vs 0.557 [ 0.249 ] , hormone therapy vs placebo , P = 0.001 , at 6 mo ) , memory and concentration capacity ( 0.849 [ 0.228 ] vs 0.454 [ 0.301 ] , P < 0.0001 , at 6 mo ) , and anxiety and fears ( 0.942 [ 0.133 ] vs 0.826 [ 0.193 ] , P = 0.005 , at 6 mo ) ."
6322,RESULTS,Hormone therapy use showed no significant impact on these variables in women without baseline flashes .
6323,CONCLUSIONS,Hot flashes contribute differently to various variables affecting health-related quality of life shortly after menopause .
6324,CONCLUSIONS,Estradiol or an estradiol-medroxyprogesterone acetate combination similarly alleviates hot flashes and improves health-related quality of life in relation to elimination of hot flashes .
6325,CONCLUSIONS,Hormone therapy use does not confer any detectable quality-of-life benefit over placebo in women without disturbing baseline flashes .
6326,BACKGROUND,A restricted sympathetic block during spinal anesthesia may minimize hemodynamic changes .

6349,RESULTS,The single freeze of CO2 did not provide sufficient depth of necrosis in either lip to infer noninferiority versus the double freeze with N2O .
6350,CONCLUSIONS,A single freeze with N2O is noninferior to a double-freeze technique in the anterior but not the posterior lip .
6351,CONCLUSIONS,"However , the result for posterior lips was close to reaching statistical significance ."
6352,CONCLUSIONS,"In addition , CO2 had approximately 1 mm shallower depth of necrosis compared with N2O techniques ; however , the clinical implications are unknown ."

6386,OBJECTIVE,"To compare neocollagenesis and elastin production stimulated by Radiesse ( calcium hydroxylapatite ; CaHA , Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH ) and a hyaluronic acid-based filler ( HA ; Juvderm VOLUMA ) ."
6387,METHODS,"Twenty-four women , aged 35-45 , participated in this split-face , comparative study ."
6388,METHODS,Punch biopsies were taken 4 and 9 months after supraperiostal injection of each filler into the ipsilateral or contralateral postauricular area .
6389,METHODS,"Samples were analyzed for collagens type I and III , elastin , Ki-67 , and inflammatory and angiogenic markers ."
6390,RESULTS,"At month 4 , collagen type III was greater with CaHA vs HA ( P = 0.0052 ) ."
6391,RESULTS,"By month 9 , type I staining was higher with CaHA vs HA ( P = 0.0135 ) , whereas type III was lower with CaHA than HA ( P = 0.0019 ) ."
6392,RESULTS,"Staining for elastin , Ki-67 and angiogenesis was greatest with CaHA at both timepoints ."
6393,RESULTS,Inflammatory markers increased most with HA treatment .
6394,CONCLUSIONS,"CaHA resulted in more active , physiologic remodeling of the extracellular matrix than HA by stimulating a two-step process whereby collagen type I gradually replaced type III ."
6395,CONCLUSIONS,Increased elastin stimulated by CaHA also indicates active remodeling .
6396,CONCLUSIONS,"The results of this study suggest that , in the first 9 months after treatment , by reconstituting tissue homeostasis without inducing inflammation suggests CaHA has more desirable characteristics for a dermal filler than HA ."
6397,BACKGROUND,Experimental evidence suggests that the inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane has a cardioprotective effect .
6398,BACKGROUND,Our objective was to determine if sedation with sevoflurane will reduce infarct size in patients with acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) who are treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
6399,METHODS,We randomized 50 patients presenting with a first acute ST-elevation MI treated by primary PCI within 6 hours from symptom onset to sedation with sevoflurane inhalation or standard sedation ( control ) .
6400,METHODS,Coronary flow at the end of PCI was assessed by corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count .
6401,METHODS,Myocardial reperfusion was assessed by ST-segment resolution 60 minutes post-PCI .
6402,METHODS,Infarct size was assessed by release of creatinine kinase ( CK ) and troponin T.
6403,RESULTS,"There was no difference in the primary end point : troponin T or CK release adjusted to the area at risk , between groups ."
6404,RESULTS,"However , among patients with anterior MI , there was a trend toward lower CK ( P = .05 ) and nonsignificant decrease in troponin ( P = .11 ) levels in the sevoflurane group ."
6405,RESULTS,Corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count was 12.3 1.5 in the sevoflurane group and 15.6 9.1 in the control group ( P = .16 ) .
6406,RESULTS,There was more ST resolution in patients treated by sevoflurane 80.7 % 25.8 % versus 56.6 % 35.7 % ( P = .01 ) .
6407,RESULTS,Sevoflurane had no significant adverse effect during administration .
6408,CONCLUSIONS,Sevoflurane administration during primary PCI did not reduce infarct size .
6409,CONCLUSIONS,There was a trend toward a reduction in infarct size among patients with anterior MI .
6410,CONCLUSIONS,Sevoflurane administration was associated with improvement in ST-segment resolution .
6411,OBJECTIVE,To compare a motivational intervention ( MI ) focused on increasing involvement in 12-Step groups ( TSGs ; e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous ) versus brief advice ( BA ) to attend TSGs .
6412,METHODS,"Patients were assigned randomly to either the MI or BA condition , and followed-up at 6 months after discharge ."
6413,METHODS,One hundred and forty substance use disorder ( SUD ) patients undergoing in-patient detoxification ( detox ) in Norway .
6414,METHODS,"The primary outcome was TSG affiliation measured with the Alcoholics Anonymous Affiliation Scale ( AAAS ) , which combines meeting attendance and TSG involvement ."
6415,METHODS,Substance use and problem severity were also measured .
6416,RESULTS,"At 6 months after treatment , compared with the BA group , the MI group had higher TSG affiliation [ 0.91 point higher AAAS score ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.04 to 1.78 ; P = 0.041 ] ."
6417,RESULTS,"The MI group reported 3.5 fewer days of alcohol use ( 2.1 versus 5.6 days ; 95 % CI = -6.5 to -0.6 ; P = 0.020 ) and 4.0 fewer days of drug use ( 3.8 versus 7.8 days ; 95 % CI = -7.5 to -0.4 ; P = 0.028 ) ; however , abstinence rates and severity scores did not differ between conditions ."
6418,RESULTS,Analyses controlling for duration of in-patient treatment did not alter the results .
6419,CONCLUSIONS,A motivational intervention in an in-patient detox ward was more successful than brief advice in terms of patient engagement in 12-Step groups and reduced substance use at 6 months after discharge .
6420,CONCLUSIONS,There is a potential benefit of adding a maintenance-focused element to standard detox .
6421,OBJECTIVE,To compare epithelial connective tissue graft vs porcine collagen matrix for sealing postextraction sockets grafted with deproteinised bovine bone .
6422,METHODS,"A total of 30 patients , who needed a maxillary tooth to be extracted between their premolars and required a delayed , fixed , single implant-supported restoration , had their teeth atraumatically extracted and their sockets grafted with deproteinised bovine bone ."
6423,METHODS,Patients were randomised according to a parallel group design into two arms : socket sealing with epithelial connective tissue graft ( group A ) vs porcine collagen matrix ( group B ) .
6424,METHODS,"Outcome measures were : implant success and survival rate , complications , horizontal and vertical alveolar bone dimensional changes measured on Cone Beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) scans at three levels localised 1 , 3 , and 5 mm below the most coronal aspect of the bone crest ( levels A , B , and C ) ; and between the palatal and buccal wall peaks ( level D ) ; and peri-implant marginal bone level changes measured on periapical radiographs ."
6425,RESULTS,15 patients were randomised to group A and 15 to group B. No patients dropped out .
6426,RESULTS,No failed implants or complications were reported 1 year after implant placement .
6427,RESULTS,Five months after tooth extraction there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups for both horizontal and vertical alveolar bone dimensional changes .
6428,RESULTS,"At level A the difference was 0.13 0.18 ; 95 % CI 0.04 to 0.26 mm ( P = 0.34 ) , at level B it was 0.08 0.23 ; 95 % CI -0.14 to 0.14 ( P = 0.61 ) , at level C it was 0.05 0.25 ; 95 % CI -0.01 to 0.31 mm ( P = 0.55 ) and at level D it was 0.13 0.27 ; 95 % CI -0.02 to 0.32 mm ( P = 0.67 ) ."
6429,RESULTS,One year after implant placement there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups for peri-implant marginal bone level changes ( difference : 0.07 0.11 mm ; 95 % CI -0.02 to 0.16 ; P = 0.41 ) .
6430,CONCLUSIONS,"When teeth extractions were performed atraumatically and sockets were filled with deproteinised bovine bone , sealing the socket with a porcine collagen matrix or a epithelial connective tissue graft showed similar outcomes ."
6431,CONCLUSIONS,The use of porcine collagen matrix allowed simplification of treatment because no palatal donor site was involved .
6432,BACKGROUND,Standard treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 ( CHC G-1 ) infection includes pegylated interferon plus ribavirin ( PEG-RBV ) for 48 weeks .
6433,BACKGROUND,Shorter treatment regimen would be more acceptable due to lower cost and fewer side-effects .
6434,BACKGROUND,We aimed to compare the efficacy of 36 week PEG-RBV therapy with standard 48 week therapy in CHC G-1 patients who achieve complete early virological response ( cEVR ) .
6435,METHODS,Consecutive treatment-nave patients with CHC G-1 were treated with pegylated interferon a2b ( 1.5 g/kg/week ) or 2a ( 180 g/week ) and weight based ribavirin .
6436,METHODS,Patients who achieved cEVR at 12 weeks [ undetectable HCV RNA irrespective of RVR ( rapid virological response ) ] were randomized into - group A ( 48 weeks therapy ) and group B ( 36 weeks therapy ) .
6437,METHODS,Primary end-point was achievement of sustained virological response ( SVR ) at 24 weeks of follow up .
6438,RESULTS,"Out of the total 166 patients started on treatment , 112 ( 69.3 % ) achieved cEVR , and were randomized into group A ( n = 59 ) and group B ( n = 53 ) ."
6439,RESULTS,Fifty-five ( 93.2 % ) patients in group A and 50 ( 94.3 % ) in group B completed therapy .
6440,RESULTS,The overall SVR rate in group A was 79.6 % ( 47/59 ) and group B was 84.9 % ( 45/53 ) ( p = 0.622 ) .
6441,RESULTS,"SVR rates in the two groups were comparable in all patient sub-groups according to factors like viral load ( or > 400,000 IU/mL ) , RVR ( achieved/not achieved ) , age ( or > 40 years ) , body mass index ( or > 27 ) and cirrhosis ( present/absent ) ."
6442,CONCLUSIONS,"In CHC G-1 patients who achieve cEVR , 36 weeks PEG-RBV therapy is as effective as standard 48 weeks therapy , irrespective of other host or virological factors ."

6455,OBJECTIVE,To assess the effectiveness of acupuncture combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) for patients with depression in hospital using a pragmatic randomised controlled trial .
6456,METHODS,"76 patients with depression were randomly divided into two groups ( randomisation ratio 2:1 for treatment and control groups ( CGs ) , respectively ) and 71 patients completed the study ."
6457,METHODS,The 45 patients in the treatment group ( TG ) underwent acupuncture and received an SSRI and the 26 patients in the CG received an SSRI only .
6458,METHODS,"The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS-17 ) was used to quantitatively assess patients after 1 , 2 , 4 and 6weeks of treatment ."
6459,RESULTS,"The mean ( SD ) baseline total HDRS scores were 22.2 ( 0.60 ) and 22.1 ( 0.33 ) in the TG and CG , respectively ."
6460,RESULTS,"After the first week of treatment the HDRS score for the TG was reduced to 15.6 ( 0.81 ) , significantly different from the score of 18.3 ( 0.55 ) for the CG , p < 0.05 ."
6461,RESULTS,"This significant difference was maintained to the end of the 6-week treatment period , when HDRS scores had fallen to 6.3 ( 0.49 ) and 8.2 ( 0.35 ) for the TG and CG , respectively ."
6462,CONCLUSIONS,Acupuncture combined with an SSRI showed a statistically significant benefit for patients with depression in hospital over the 6-week period compared with SSRIs alone .
6463,CONCLUSIONS,This reduction in symptoms started in the first week and continued throughout the 6weeks of treatment .
6464,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to evaluate the population pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and exposure-response relationship of edoxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation ( AF ) .
6465,METHODS,"Concentration data from 1,134 subjects in 11 clinical studies ( eight phase I , one phase II , and two phase III ) were used to perform a population PK analysis , including estimation of the bioavailability and quantification of the effects of P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) inhibitors as well as renal impairment on edoxaban PK ."
6466,METHODS,The potential relationship between edoxaban PK exposure and incidence of bleeding events was explored based on data from 893 AF patients .
6467,RESULTS,Absolute bioavailability of edoxaban was estimated as 58.3 % .
6468,RESULTS,"With oral dosing of edoxaban , co-administration of various P-gp inhibitors significantly increased edoxaban bioavailability and decreased volume of distribution ( V 2 ) , resulting in a predicted increase of 33-77 % in area under the curve ( AUC ) and 65-104 % in C max ."
6469,RESULTS,"A much smaller increase was seen in edoxaban concentration at 24 h post-dose ( C 24 , -24 to 38 % ) , due to decreased V 2 and shortened elimination half-life ."
6470,RESULTS,"With IV dosing of edoxaban , co-administration of the P-gp inhibitor quinidine decreased both edoxaban clearance ( CL ) and V 2 , resulting in an increase of 32 % in AUC and 66 % in C 24 ."
6471,RESULTS,"Creatinine clearance was a significant covariate on renal clearance , whereas age and body weight significantly affected nonrenal clearance ."
6472,RESULTS,"Model-predicted steady state C min was slightly higher , but AUC was comparable for patients who had severe renal impairment and received edoxaban 15 mg once daily ( QD ) versus patients who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment and received edoxaban 30 mg QD ."
6473,RESULTS,Exposure-response analysis suggested that edoxaban C min and country/region are significantly associated with the incidence of bleeds .
6474,CONCLUSIONS,"The model provided reasonable estimation with regard to the absolute bioavailability of edoxaban , the magnitude of change in edoxaban exposure upon co-administration of P-gp inhibitors , and the impact of renal impairment on edoxaban clearance ."
6475,CONCLUSIONS,Analysis results supported a 50 % dose reduction scheme for subjects with severe renal impairment .
6476,CONCLUSIONS,Further confirmation will be sought by incorporating clinical safety and efficacy information from larger phase III trials .
6477,BACKGROUND,We sought to determine if outcomes with exercise training in heart failure ( HF ) vary according to ventricular pacing type .

6481,RESULTS,"Patients with pacing devices were older , more frequently white , and had lower peak VO2 ( P < .001 for all ) ."
6482,RESULTS,Peak VO2 improved similarly with training in groups with and without pacing devices .
6483,RESULTS,"The primary composite end point-all-cause death or hospitalization-was reduced only in patients randomized to exercise training without a device ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 0.79 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.67-0 .93 [ P = .004 ] ; RV lead : HR 1.04 , 95 % CI 0.84-1 .28 [ P = .74 ] ; BiV pacing : HR 1.05 , 95 % CI 0.82-1 .34 [ P = .72 ] ; interaction P = .058 ) ."
6484,CONCLUSIONS,Exercise training may improve exercise capacity in patients with implanted cardiac devices .
6485,CONCLUSIONS,"However , the apparent beneficial effects of exercise on hospitalization or death may be attenuated in patients with implanted cardiac devices and requires further study ."
6486,OBJECTIVE,Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4 ) is thought to intensify the physiological effects of the incretin hormones .
6487,OBJECTIVE,"We investigated the effects of DPP4 inhibition on plasma levels of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) , glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP1 ) , incretin effect , glucose tolerance , gastrointestinal-mediated glucose disposal ( GIGD ) and gastric emptying in healthy subjects ."

6491,RESULTS,Isoglycaemia was obtained in all subjects on the paired study days .
6492,RESULTS,Significant increases in fasting levels and OGTT-induced responses of active GLP1 and GIP were seen after DPP4 inhibition .
6493,RESULTS,"No significant impact of DPP4 inhibition on fasting plasma glucose ( 5.10.1 vs 4.90.1 mmol/l , P = 0.3 ) , glucose tolerance ( area under the curve ( AUC ) for plasma glucose , 15135 vs 13726mmol/lmin , P = 0.7 ) or peak plasma glucose during OGTT ( 8.50.4 vs 8.10.3 mmol/l , P = 0.3 ) was observed ."
6494,RESULTS,"Neither incretin effect ( 409 % ( without DPP4 inhibitor ) vs 407 % ( with DPP4 inhibitor ) , P = 1.0 ) , glucagon responses ( 1395165 vs 1223195pmol/lmin , P = 0.41 ) , GIGD ( 524 vs 565 % , P = 0.40 ) nor gastric emptying ( Tmax for plasma paracetamol : 869 vs 8012min , P = 0.60 ) changed following DPP4 inhibition ."
6495,CONCLUSIONS,"These results suggest that acute increases in active incretin hormone levels do not affect glucose tolerance , GIGD , incretin effect , glucagon responses or gastric emptying in healthy subjects ."
6496,OBJECTIVE,"Patients 65 years old ( `` older '' ) are often not included in randomized clinical trials ( RCT ) , but when they are , care in an RCT might improve quality of life ( QoL ) ."

6513,RESULTS,"Contingency analysis for the presence/absence of ACA in the AR group versus the control group showed a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 0.46 ( relative risk = 6.5 [ 95 % CI 0.94 to 44.8 ] , p = 0.01 ) ."
6514,RESULTS,The consecutive application of 3 pCLE criteria resulted in a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 0.83 for detection of AR .
6515,CONCLUSIONS,Our observational survey suggests the existence of specific pCLE characteristics in patients with AR .
6516,CONCLUSIONS,Further efforts are necessary to validate these findings prospectively .

6521,METHODS,The presence of virus in vomitus was also assessed .
6522,RESULTS,Fifty-seven persons were enrolled ; 8 received placebo and an additional 8 persons were considered to be nonsusceptible on the basis of being secretor negative .
6523,RESULTS,"Twenty-one persons were infected ( all blood group O or A ) , and 67 % of those infected developed viral gastroenteritis ."
6524,RESULTS,The 50 % human infectious dose was calculated to be 3.3 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction units ( approximately 1320 genomic equivalents [ gEq ] ) for secretor-positive blood group O or A persons and 7.0 ( approximately 2800 gEq ) for all secretor-positive persons .
6525,RESULTS,The time of illness onset was inversely correlated with inoculum dose .
6526,RESULTS,The maximal concentration of virus shedding was higher for persons with gastroenteritis .

6530,BACKGROUND,Hospital readmissions for acute exacerbations of COPD ( AECOPDs ) pose burdens to the health-care system and patients .
6531,BACKGROUND,A current gap in knowledge is whether a predischarge screening and educational tool administered to patients with COPD reduces readmissions and ED visits .
6532,METHODS,"A single-center , randomized trial of admitted patients with AECOPDs was conducted at Henry Ford Hospital between February 2010 and April 2013 ."
6533,METHODS,"One hundred seventy-two patients were randomized to either the control ( standard care ) or the bundle group in which patients received smoking cessation counseling , screening for gastroesophageal reflux disease and depression or anxiety , standardized inhaler education , and a 48-h postdischarge telephone call ."
6534,METHODS,The primary end point was the difference in the composite risk of hospitalizations or ED visits for AECOPD between the two groups in the 30 days following discharge .
6535,METHODS,A secondary end point was 90-day readmission rate .
6536,RESULTS,"Of the 172 patients , 18 of 79 in the control group ( 22.78 % ) and 18 of 93 in the bundle group ( 19.35 % ) were readmitted within 30 days ."
6537,RESULTS,"The risk of ED visits or hospitalizations within 30 days was not different between the groups ( risk difference , -3.43 % ; 95 % CI , -15.68 % to 8.82 % ; P = .58 ) ."
6538,RESULTS,"Overall , the time to readmission in 30 and 90 days was similar between groups ( log-rank test P = .71 and .88 , respectively ) ."
6539,CONCLUSIONS,A predischarge bundle intervention in AECOPD is not sufficient to reduce the 30-day risk of hospitalizations or ED visits .
6540,CONCLUSIONS,More resources may be needed to generate a measurable effect on readmission rates .

6553,BACKGROUND,Patients with a pacing indication and first-degree atrioventricular ( AV ) - block pose a clinical challenge .
6554,BACKGROUND,The prognostic impact of first-degree AV-block in patients with sinus node dysfunction and the impact of pacing in this setting are not known .
6555,METHODS,"In the Mode Selection Trial ( MOST ) , 2,010 patients with sinus node dysfunction were randomized to either dual-chamber ( DDD-R ) or ventricular ( VVI-R ) pacing and followed for a median of 33 months ."
6556,METHODS,We report on clinical outcomes in patients with first-degree AV-block ( PR interval > 200 ms ) compared with patients who had a normal PR interval at baseline .
6557,RESULTS,"Patients with first-degree AV-block ( n = 378 ) were older ( median [ Q1 , Q3 ] ; 76 [ 70 , 82 ] years vs 73 [ 66 , 79 ] years , P < 0.0001 ) , more often male ( 57 % vs 49 % , P = 0.0049 ) , and had more comorbidity , such as hypertension ( 66 % vs 60 % , P = 0.034 ) and heart failure ( 24 % vs 17 % , P = 0.0050 ) than patients with normal AV-conduction ( n = 1,159 ) ."
6558,RESULTS,"In multivariable analyses , patients with first-degree AV-block were at greater risk of death , stroke , or heart failure hospitalization ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.31 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.06-1 .61 , P = 0.013 ) ."
6559,RESULTS,"A trend towards a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation was seen ( HR 1.24 , 95 % CI 0.98-1 .55 , P = 0.069 ) ."
6560,RESULTS,"No significant interactions between pacing arm and prolonged versus normal PR were found for any endpoint , and hazard ratios were consistent across subgroups ."
6561,CONCLUSIONS,First-degree AV-block is associated with more advanced disease but is still an independent predictor of poor clinical outcome .
6562,CONCLUSIONS,"Neither DDD-R nor VVI-R pacing , as employed in MOST , eliminate the negative effects associated with first-degree AV-block ."
6563,BACKGROUND,This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of a granule formulation of dolutegravir developed as an alternative to tablets for use in paediatric populations .
6564,METHODS,"A randomized , open-label study in healthy adults was carried out ."
6565,METHODS,"Subjects received five treatments in a crossover design : a single dose of dolutegravir 50 mg as a tablet and dolutegravir 50 mg in 10 g of granule administered directly to mouth or mixed with purified water , water containing high cation concentrations or milk-based infant formula ."
6566,METHODS,Study treatments were separated by 7 days .
6567,METHODS,Safety evaluations and serial pharmacokinetic sampling were done during each treatment period .
6568,METHODS,A non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed ; geometric least-squares mean ratios and 90 % CIs were generated for treatment comparison .
6569,METHODS,Palatability was assessed by questionnaire .
6570,RESULTS,Plasma dolutegravir exposures in all granule treatment arms exceeded those of tablet formulation .

6583,RESULTS,"Compared with control cows , treatment increased energy corrected milk yield ( 33.3 vs. 37.8 ( SEM 1.10 ) kg/day ; p = 0.006 ) and milk fat yield ( 1.14 vs. 1.32 ( SEM 0.06 ) kg/day ; p = 0.05 ) over the first 21 days of lactation ."
6584,RESULTS,"Treated cows had lower mean log10 SCC compared to control cows ( 4.9 vs. 5.24 ( SEM 0.11 ) log10 cells/mL ) and had lower overall concentration of TBARS ( 1.47 vs. 1.59 ( SEM 0.016 ) nM/mL ; p < 0.001 ) , but similar concentrations of ROM and OXY in serum ."
6585,RESULTS,"However there was a treatment by time interaction ( p = 0.09 ) for OXY , and at calving mean OXY was higher in treated cows compared with pre-calving values ( p < 0.001 ) ."
6586,CONCLUSIONS,"Despite the acknowledged limitation of the study , i.e. the small number of animals , our results suggest that silymarin and lycopene , as health-beneficial feed supplements , may help dairy cows in metabolic adaptation during the first stages of lactation ."
6587,CONCLUSIONS,During the peripartum period dairy cows suffer moderate-to-severe fatty liver and from an overproduction of free radicals .
6588,CONCLUSIONS,The supplementation of a mixture of silymarin and lycopene during these stressful days may be useful to mitigate these metabolic disorders with beneficial effects on the subsequent lactation .

6602,OBJECTIVE,The prognostic importance of the speed of early hematoma growth in acute intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) has not been well established .
6603,OBJECTIVE,We aimed to determine the association between the rate of increase in hematoma volume and major clinical outcomes in the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial ( INTERACT ) studies .
6604,OBJECTIVE,The effects of early intensive blood pressure ( BP ) lowering according to the speed of hematoma growth were also investigated .
6605,METHODS,"Pooled analyses of the INTERACT1 ( n = 404 ) and INTERACT2 ( n = 2,839 ) studies-randomized controlled trials of patients with spontaneous ICH with elevated systolic BP , randomly assigned to intensive ( target systolic BP < 140 mm Hg ) or guideline-based ( < 180 mm Hg ) BP management ."
6606,METHODS,The speed of ultraearly hematoma growth ( UHG ) was defined as hematoma volume ( mL ) / onset-to-CT time ( hours ) .
6607,METHODS,Primary outcome was death or major disability ( modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6 ) at 90 days .
6608,RESULTS,"Among a total of 2,909 patients ( 90 % ) with information on UHG and outcome , median speed of UHG was 6.2 mL/h ."
6609,RESULTS,There was a linear association between UHG and outcome : multivariable-adjusted odd ratios 1.90 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.50-2 .39 ) for 5-10 mL/h and 2.96 ( 2.36-3 .71 ) for > 10 mL/h vs the < 5 mL/h group .
6610,RESULTS,There were no clear differences in the effects of intensive BP lowering according to 3 speeds of UHG on outcome ( p = 0.75 for homogeneity ) .
6611,CONCLUSIONS,"The speed of UHG in patients with ICH was continuously associated with increased risks of death or major disability , and from lower levels than previously reported ( 5 mL/h ) ."
6612,CONCLUSIONS,The benefits of intensive BP lowering appear to be independent of the speed of bleeding .
6613,BACKGROUND,Photodynamic therapy is an effective tool in the management of some forms of skin cancer and generalized solar dermopathy and can be beneficial in the management of acne vulgaris .

6621,OBJECTIVE,To compare the effectiveness of the traditional center of tibial plateau as the entry point and digital technology in the design of intramedullary tibial nail point positioning method in total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) .
6622,METHODS,"Between October 2011 and October 2012 , 60 cases undergoing unilateral TKA and meeting the selection criteria were randomly divided into 2 groups : in group A ( 30 cases ) , the tibial plateau center as the entry point of tibial intramedullary positioning was used ; in group B ( 30 cases ) , Mimics 10.01 software to simulate the guide rod point of tibial intramedullary positioning was used ."
6623,METHODS,"There was no significant difference in gender , age , etiology , disease duration , sides , and preoperative knee range of motion , Hospital for Special Surgery ( HSS ) score , and Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) between 2 groups ( P > 0.05 ) ."
6624,METHODS,"Postoperative X-ray films were taken to measure the tibiofemoral angle and tibial angle ; knee range of motion , and HSS and WOMAC scores were used to assess the activity of knee ."
6625,RESULTS,"The entry point of group B was located in front of the center of tibial plateau , which was inconsistent with the traditional entry point ."
6626,RESULTS,The incision healed by first intention in all patients of 2 groups .
6627,RESULTS,"The patients were followed up 6 to 12 months ( mean , 8.6 months ) ."
6628,RESULTS,"The X-ray measurement at 1 week after operation showed no significant difference in tibiofemoral angle between 2 groups ( t = -6.65 , P = 0.72 ) , but the anteroposterior and lateral tibial angles of group A were significantly lower than those of group B ( P < 0.05 ) ."
6629,RESULTS,"The knee range of motion , HSS score , and WOMAC score of 2 groups were significantly higher at 3 and 6 months after operation when compared with preoperative values ( P < 0.05 ) , and the values at 6 months were significantly increased than those at 3 months after operation ( P < 0.05 ) ."
6630,RESULTS,"HSS score and WOMAC score had no significant difference between 2 groups at 3 months after operation ( P > 0.05 ) , but the scores of group B were significantly higher than those of group A at 6 months ( P < 0.05 ) ."
6631,RESULTS,"The knee range of motion of group B was significantly better than that of group A at 3 months after operation ( t = 2.13 , P = 0.04 ) , but no significant difference was found between 2 groups at 6 months ( t = 0.58 , P = 0.56 ) ."
6632,CONCLUSIONS,"Compared with the traditional intramedullary guide rod insertion point positioning , digital individualized design of entry point positioning has the advantages of more accurate lower limb force line , better recovery of knee function , and earlier 90 degrees activities , but the long-term effectiveness needs further observation ."
6633,BACKGROUND,Chronic alcohol abuse has been traditionally associated with impaired cognitive abilities .
6634,BACKGROUND,"The deficits are most evident in higher order cognitive functions , such as abstract reasoning , problem solving and visuospatial processing ."
6635,BACKGROUND,The present study sought to increase current understanding of the neuropsychological basis of poor abstract reasoning abilities in alcohol-dependent subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
6636,METHODS,An abstract reasoning task-based fMRI study was carried out on alcohol-dependent subjects ( n = 18 ) and healthy controls ( n = 18 ) to examine neural activation pattern .
6637,METHODS,The study was carried out using a 3-T whole-body magnetic resonance scanner .
6638,METHODS,Preprocessing and post processing was performed using SPM 8 software .
6639,RESULTS,Behavioral data indicated that alcohol-dependent subjects took more time than controls for performing the task but there was no significant difference in their response accuracy .
6640,RESULTS,"Analysis of the fMRI data indicated that for solving abstract reasoning-based problems , alcohol-dependent subjects showed enhanced right frontoparietal neural activation involving inferior frontal gyrus , post central gyrus , superior parietal lobule , and occipito-temporal gyrus ."
6641,CONCLUSIONS,The extensive activation observed in alcohol dependents as compared to controls suggests that alcohol dependents recruit additional brain areas to meet the behavioral demands for equivalent task performance .
6642,CONCLUSIONS,The results are consistent with previous fMRI studies suggesting decreased neural efficiency of relevant brain networks or compensatory mechanisms for the execution of task for showing an equivalent performance .

6710,BACKGROUND,Despite scientific advances in typing of C. difficile strains very little is known about how hospital staff use typing results during periods of increased incidence ( PIIs ) .
6711,BACKGROUND,"This qualitative study , undertaken alongside a randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) , explored this issue ."
6712,BACKGROUND,The trial compared ribotyping versus more rapid genotyping ( MLVA or multilocus variable repeat analysis ) and found no significant difference in post 48 hour cases ( C difficile transmissions ) .
6713,METHODS,In-depth qualitative interviews with senior staff in 11/16 hospital trusts in the trial ( 5 MLVA and 6 Ribotyping ) .
6714,METHODS,Semi-structured interviews were conducted at end of the trial period .
6715,METHODS,Transcripts were content analysed using framework analysis supported by NVivo-8 software .
6716,METHODS,Common sub-themes were extracted by two researchers independently .
6717,METHODS,These were compared and organised into over-arching categories or ` super-ordinate themes ' .
6718,RESULTS,The trial recorded that 45 % of typing tests had some impact on infection control ( IC ) activities .
6719,RESULTS,Interviews indicated that tests had little impact on initial IC decisions .
6720,RESULTS,These were driven by hospital protocols and automatically triggered when a PII was identified .
6721,RESULTS,"To influence decision-making , a laboratory turnaround time < 3 days ( ideally 24 hours ) was suggested ; MLVA turnaround time was 5.3 days ."
6722,RESULTS,"Typing results were predominantly used to modify initiated IC activities such as ward cleaning , audits of practice or staff training ; major decisions ( e.g. ward closure ) were unaffected ."
6723,RESULTS,Organisational factors could limit utilisation of MLVA results .
6724,RESULTS,Results were twice as likely to be reported as ` aiding management ' ( indirect benefit ) than impacting on IC activities ( direct effect ) .
6725,RESULTS,Some interviewees considered test results provided reassurance about earlier IC decisions ; others identified secondary benefits on organisational culture .
6726,RESULTS,An underlying benefit of improved discrimination provided by MLVA typing was the ability to explore epidemiology associated with CDI cases in a hospital more thoroughly .
6727,CONCLUSIONS,Ribotyping and MLVA are both valued by users .
6728,CONCLUSIONS,MLVA had little additional direct impact on initial infection control decisions .
6729,CONCLUSIONS,This would require reduced turnaround time .
6730,CONCLUSIONS,The major impact is adjustments to earlier IC measures and retrospective reassurance .
6731,CONCLUSIONS,"For this , turnaround time is less important than discriminatory power ."
6732,CONCLUSIONS,The potential remains for wider use of genotyping to examine transmission routes .
6733,OBJECTIVE,To test whether red blood cell ( RBC ) levels of marine omega-3 fatty acids measured in the Women 's Health Initiative Memory Study were related to MRI brain volumes measured 8 years later .
6734,METHODS,"RBC eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , and MRI brain volumes were assessed in 1,111 postmenopausal women from the Women 's Health Initiative Memory Study ."
6735,METHODS,The endpoints were total brain volume and anatomical regions .
6736,METHODS,"Linear mixed models included multiple imputations of fatty acids and were adjusted for hormone therapy , time since randomization , demographics , intracranial volume , and cardiovascular disease risk factors ."
6737,RESULTS,"In fully adjusted models , a 1 SD greater RBC EPA + DHA ( omega-3 index ) level was correlated with 2.1 cm ( 3 ) larger brain volume ( p = 0.048 ) ."
6738,RESULTS,DHA was marginally correlated ( p = 0.063 ) with total brain volume while EPA was less so ( p = 0.11 ) .
6739,RESULTS,"There were no correlations between ischemic lesion volumes and EPA , DHA , or EPA + DHA ."
6740,RESULTS,"A 1 SD greater omega-3 index was correlated with greater hippocampal volume ( 50 mm ( 3 ) , p = 0.036 ) in fully adjusted models ."
6741,RESULTS,"Comparing the fourth quartile vs the first quartile of the omega-3 index confirmed greater hippocampal volume ( 159 mm ( 3 ) , p = 0.034 ) ."
6742,CONCLUSIONS,A higher omega-3 index was correlated with larger total normal brain volume and hippocampal volume in postmenopausal women measured 8 years later .
6743,CONCLUSIONS,"While normal aging results in overall brain atrophy , lower omega-3 index may signal increased risk of hippocampal atrophy ."
6744,CONCLUSIONS,Future studies should examine whether maintaining higher RBC EPA + DHA levels slows the rate of hippocampal or overall brain atrophy .
6745,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the analgesic and physiological effects of epidural morphine administered at the sixth and seventh lumbar or the fifth and sixth thoracic vertebrae in dogs undergoing thoracotomy .
6746,METHODS,"Prospective , randomized , blinded trial ."
6747,METHODS,"Fourteen mixed-breed dogs , weighing 8.6 1.4 kg ."
6748,METHODS,The animals received acepromazine ( 0.1 mg kg ) IM and anesthesia was induced with propofol ( 4 mg kg ) IV .
6749,METHODS,"The lumbosacral space was punctured and an epidural catheter was inserted up to the region between the sixth and seventh lumbar vertebrae ( L , n = 6 ) or up to the fifth or sixth intercostal space ( T , n = 8 ) ."
6750,METHODS,"The dogs were allowed to recover and after radiographic confirmation of correct catheter position , anesthesia was reinduced with propofol IV and maintained with 1.7 % isoflurane ."
6751,METHODS,"Following stabilization of monitored parameters , animals received morphine ( 0.1 mg kg ) diluted in 0.9 % NaCl to a final volume of 0.25 mL kg via the epidural catheter , and after 40 minutes , thoracotomy was initiated ."
6752,METHODS,"Heart rate and rhythm , systolic , mean and diastolic arterial pressures , respiratory rate , arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation , partial pressure of expired CO and body temperature were measured immediately before the epidural administration of morphine ( 0 minute ) and every 10 minutes during the anesthetic period ."
6753,METHODS,The Melbourne pain scale and the visual analog scale were used to assess postoperative pain .
6754,METHODS,The evaluation began 3 hours after the epidural administration of morphine and occurred each hour until rescue analgesia .
6755,RESULTS,There were no important variations in the physiological parameters during the anesthetic period .
6756,RESULTS,"The post-operative analgesic period differed between the groups , being longer in T ( 9.9 01.6 hours ) compared with L ( 5.8 0.8 hours ) ."
6757,CONCLUSIONS,"The use of morphine , at a volume of 0.25 mL kg 0.1 , administered epidurally over the thoracic vertebrae provided longer lasting analgesia than when deposited over the lumbar vertebrae ."
6758,BACKGROUND,There are no randomized studies that compare outcomes after single-incision ( SLC ) and conventional multi-incision ( MLC ) laparoscopic cholecystectomy under an optimized perioperative analgesic regimen .
6759,METHODS,This patient - and assessor-blinded randomized three-centre clinical trial compared SLC and MLC in women admitted electively with cholecystolithiasis .
6760,METHODS,"Outcomes were registered on the day of operation ( day 0 ) , on postoperative days 1 , 2 , 3 and 30 , and 12months after surgery ."
6761,METHODS,Blinding of the patients was maintained until day 3 .
6762,METHODS,"The primary endpoint was pain on movement measured on a visual analogue scale , reported repeatedly by the patient until day 3 ."
6763,RESULTS,The intention-to-treat population comprised 59 patients in the SLC and 58 in the MLC group .
6764,RESULTS,"There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to any of the pain-related outcomes , on-demand administration of opioids or general discomfort ."
6765,RESULTS,Median duration of surgery was 325min longer in the SLC group ( P < 0001 ) .
6766,RESULTS,SLC was associated with a reduced incidence of vomiting on day 0 ( 7 versus 22 per cent ; P = 0019 ) .
6767,RESULTS,The incidences of wound-related problems were comparable .
6768,RESULTS,One patient in the SLC group experienced a biliary leak requiring endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography .
6769,RESULTS,The rates of incisional hernia at 12-month follow-up were 2 per cent in both groups .
6770,RESULTS,Cosmetic rating was significantly improved after SLC at 1 and 12months ( P < 0001 ) .
6771,CONCLUSIONS,SLC did not significantly diminish early pain in a setting with optimized perioperative analgesic patient care .
6772,CONCLUSIONS,SLC may reduce postoperative vomiting .

6774,BACKGROUND,The efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) has been established .
6775,BACKGROUND,"The objective of the present study was to compare the efficacy and safety in the Central African Republic ( CAR ) of three commercially available artemisinin-based combinations , artemether + lumefantrine ( AL ) , artesunate + sulphamethoxypyrazine-pyrimethamine ( AS-SMP ) and artesunate + amodiaquine ( AS-AQ ) , with those of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine + amodiaquine ( SP-AQ ) , which was the first-line reference treatment in the country from 2004 , until it was replaced by ACT in 2006 in accordance with changes in international recommendations based on resistance identified in other regions ."
6776,METHODS,"Children aged six to 59 months with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were recruited in Bangui , the capital of the CAR ."
6777,METHODS,"The 251 patients selected were randomly assigned to receive AL ( n = 60 ) , AS-SMP ( n = 58 ) , AS-AQ ( n = 68 ) or SP-AQ ( n = 65 ) and were followed up for 28 days ."
6778,METHODS,Clinical outcome was classified according to the standard 2003 World Health Organization protocol .
6779,RESULTS,"At day 28 , the cure rates in a per-protocol analysis were 92 % ( 48/52 ) with AL , 93 % ( 50/54 ) with AS-SMP , 93 % ( 55/59 ) with AS-AQ and 100 % ( 57/57 ) with SP-AQ , with no statistically significant difference between the four treatments ."
6780,RESULTS,Defervescence was significantly faster with AS-AQ than with AL ( p < 0.035 ) .
6781,RESULTS,Fatigue was reported significantly more frequently by patients receiving AQ than by those treated with AS-SMP or AL ( p = 0.006 ) .
6782,RESULTS,"All the other adverse events reported were mild , and no significant difference was noted by treatment ."
6783,CONCLUSIONS,"The three artemisinin-bsed combinations show similar , satisfactory results , comparable to that with SP-AQ ."
6784,CONCLUSIONS,This evaluation is the first conducted in CAR since the official introduction of ACT .
6785,CONCLUSIONS,It should guide the National Malaria Control Programme in choosing the appropriate ACT for treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in the future .
6786,OBJECTIVE,The control of body lice in homeless persons remains a challenge .
6787,OBJECTIVE,To determine whether the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated underwear provides effective long-term protection against body lice in homeless persons .
6788,METHODS,"A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was conducted in February and December 2011 in 2 homeless shelters ( Madrague Ville and Forbin ) in Marseille , France ."
6789,METHODS,"Of the 125 homeless persons screened for eligibility , 73 body lice-infested homeless persons , 18 years or older , were enrolled ."
6790,METHODS,"Body lice-infested homeless persons were randomly assigned to receive 0.4 % permethrin-impregnated underwear or an identical-appearing placebo for 45 days , in a 1:1 ratio , with a permuted block size of 10 ."
6791,METHODS,Visits were scheduled at days 14 and 45 .
6792,METHODS,Data regarding the presence or absence of live body lice were collected .
6793,METHODS,"The primary and secondary end points were the proportions of homeless persons free of body lice on days 14 and 45 , respectively ."
6794,METHODS,Mutations associated with permethrin resistance in the body lice were also identified .
6795,RESULTS,"Significantly more homeless persons receiving permethrin-impregnated underwear than homeless persons receiving the placebo were free of body lice on day 14 in the intent-to-treat population ( 28 % vs 9 % ; P = .04 ) , with a between-group difference of 18.4 percentage points ( 95 % CI , 1.4-35 .4 ) , and in the per-protocol population ( 34 % vs 11 % ; P = .03 ) , with a between-group difference of 23.7 percentage points ( 95 % CI , 3.6-43 .7 ) ."
6796,RESULTS,This difference was not sustained on day 45 .
6797,RESULTS,"At baseline , the prevalence of the permethrin-resistant haplotype was 51 % in the permethrin group and 44 % in the placebo group ."
6798,RESULTS,"On day 45 , the permethrin-resistant haplotype was significantly more frequent in the permethrin group than in the placebo group ( 73 % vs 45 % , P < .001 ) ."
6799,CONCLUSIONS,"Permethrin-impregnated underwear is more efficient than placebo at eliminating body louse infestations by day 14 ; however , this difference was not sustained on day 45 ."
6800,CONCLUSIONS,The use of permethrin may have increased the resistance to permethrin in body lice and thus must be avoided .

6802,BACKGROUND,Animal studies have shown that methylphenidate ( MPH ) and fluoxetine ( FLX ) have different effects on dopaminergic and serotonergic system in the developing brain compared to the developed brain .
6803,BACKGROUND,The effects of Psychotropic drugs On the Developing brain ( ePOD ) study is a combination of different approaches to determine whether there are related findings in humans .
6804,METHODS,Animal studies were carried out to investigate age-related effects of psychotropic drugs and to validate new neuroimaging techniques .
6805,METHODS,"In addition , we set up two double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials with MPH in 50 boys ( 10-12 years ) and 50 young men ( 23-40 years ) suffering from ADHD ( ePOD-MPH ) and with FLX in 40 girls ( 12-14 years ) and 40 young women ( 23-40 years ) suffering from depression and anxiety disorders ( ePOD-SSRI ) ."
6806,METHODS,Trial registration numbers are : Nederlands Trial Register NTR3103 and NTR2111 .
6807,METHODS,A cross-sectional cohort study on age-related effects of these psychotropic medications in patients who have been treated previously with MPH or FLX ( ePOD-Pharmo ) is also ongoing .
6808,METHODS,"The effects of psychotropic drugs on the developing brain are studied using neuroimaging techniques together with neuropsychological and psychiatric assessments of cognition , behavior and emotion ."
6809,METHODS,"All assessments take place before , during ( only in case of MPH ) and after chronic treatment ."
6810,CONCLUSIONS,The combined results of these approaches will provide new insight into the modulating effect of MPH and FLX on brain development .
6811,BACKGROUND,"Cigarette demand , or the change in cigarette consumption as a function of price , is a measure of reinforcement that is associated with level of tobacco dependence and other clinically relevant measures , but the effects of experimentally controlled income on real-world cigarette consumption have not been examined ."
6812,METHODS,"In this study , income available for cigarette purchases was manipulated to assess the effect on cigarette demand ."
6813,METHODS,"Tobacco-dependent cigarette smokers ( n = 15 ) who smoked 10-40 cigarettes per day completed a series of cigarette purchasing tasks under a variety of income conditions meant to mimic different weekly cigarette budgets : $ 280 , approximately $ 127 , $ 70 , or approximately $ 32 per week ."
6814,METHODS,"Prices of $ 0.12 , $ 0.25 , $ 0.50 , and $ 1.00 per cigarette were assessed in each income condition ."
6815,METHODS,Participants were instructed to purchase as many cigarettes as they would like for the next week and to only consume cigarettes purchased in the context of the study .
6816,METHODS,"One price in 1 income condition was randomly chosen to be `` real , '' and the cigarettes and the excess money in the budget for that condition were given to the participant ."
6817,RESULTS,Results indicate that demand elasticity was negatively correlated with income .
6818,RESULTS,Demand intensity ( consumption at low prices ) was unrelated to income condition and remained high across incomes .
6819,CONCLUSIONS,"These results indicate that the amount of income that is available for cigarette purchases has a large effect on cigarette consumption , but only at high prices ."
6820,BACKGROUND,Fibrates were found to reduce cytokine release and low-grade inflammation in patients with impaired glucose tolerance .
6821,BACKGROUND,The aim of this study was to investigate whether these effects of fibrates may be potentiated by metformin treatment .
6822,METHODS,The study included 43 patients with isolated impaired glucose tolerance and normal plasma lipids who had been treated for at least 6 months with micronized fenofibrate ( 200 mg daily ) .
6823,METHODS,These subjects were randomly assigned to 12 weeks ' treatment with either high dose metformin ( 3 g daily in three divided doses ) or placebo .
6824,METHODS,"Plasma lipids , glucose homeostasis markers , monocyte cytokine release and plasma C-reactive protein levels were determined before randomization and at the end of the treatment ."
6825,RESULTS,"Metformin treatment reduced plasma C-reactive protein levels and monocyte release of tumor necrosis factor - and interleukin-6 , as well as tended to reduce monocyte release of interleukin-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 , which was accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity ."
6826,CONCLUSIONS,Our results show that high-dose metformin produces monocyte-suppressing and systemic anti-inflammatory effects in fibrate-treated patients with isolated impaired glucose tolerance .
6827,CONCLUSIONS,This suggests that fibrate-metformin combination therapy may bring clinical benefits to impaired glucose tolerance patients at high cardiovascular risk .

6836,RESULTS,A total of 156 children and adults were randomized .
6837,RESULTS,"Between baseline and 12 months , the mean ( SD ) within-group difference in POEM score in patients in the direct-access online group was -5.1 ( 5.48 ) ( 95 % CI , -6.32 to -3.88 ) ; in the in-person group , the within-group difference was -4.86 ( 4.87 ) ( 95 % CI , -6.27 to -3.46 ) ."
6838,RESULTS,"The difference in the change in POEM scores between the 2 groups was 0.24 ( 6.59 ) ( 90 % CI , -1.70 to 1.23 ) , which was contained within the predetermined 2.5 equivalence margin ."
6839,RESULTS,"The percentage of patients achieving clearance or near-clearance of their disease ( IGA score of 0 or 1 ) was 38.4 % ( 95 % CI , 27.7 % to 49.3 % ) in the direct-access online group and 43.6 % ( 95 % CI , 32.6 % -54.6 % ) in the in-person group ."
6840,RESULTS,"The difference in the percent of patients achieving clearance or near-clearance between the 2 groups was 5.1 % ( 90 % CI , 1.7 % -8.6 % ) , which was contained within the predetermined 10 % equivalence margin ."

6844,OBJECTIVE,"We report the results of the investigation of safety and efficacy of venous angioplasty in patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) with findings of extracranial venous anomalies , considered hallmarks of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency ( CCSVI ) , in a 2-phase study ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01450072 ) ."
6845,METHODS,"Phase 1 was an open-label safety study ( 10 patients ) ; phase 2 was sham-controlled , randomized , and double-blind ( 10 sham procedure , 9 treated ) ."
6846,METHODS,All study patients fulfilled venous hemodynamic screening criteria indicative of CCSVI .
6847,METHODS,"Assessment was at 1 , 3 , and 6 months postprocedure with MRI , clinical , and hemodynamic outcomes ."
6848,METHODS,"Primary endpoints were safety at 24 hours and 1 month , venous outflow restoration > 75 % at 1 month , and effect of angioplasty on new lesion activity and relapse rate over 6 months ."
6849,METHODS,"Secondary endpoints included changes in disability , brain volume , cognitive tests , and quality of life ."
6850,RESULTS,"No perioperative complications were noted ; however , one patient with history of syncope was diagnosed with episodic bradycardia requiring placement of a pacemaker before discharge ."
6851,RESULTS,Doppler evidence-based venous hemodynamic insufficiency severity score ( VHISS ) was reduced > 75 % compared to baseline in phase 1 ( at 1 month ) but not phase 2 .
6852,RESULTS,"In phase 2 , higher MRI activity ( cumulative number of new contrast-enhancing lesions [ 19 vs 3 , p = 0.062 ] and new T2 lesions [ 17 vs 3 , p = 0.066 ] ) and relapse activity ( 4 vs 1 , p = 0.389 ) were identified as nonsignificant trends in the treated vs sham arm over 6 months ."
6853,RESULTS,"Using analysis of covariance , significant cumulative new T2 lesions were related to larger VHISS decrease ( p = 0.028 ) and angioplasty ( p = 0.01 ) over the follow-up ."
6854,RESULTS,No differences in other endpoints were detected .
6855,CONCLUSIONS,Venous angioplasty is not an effective treatment for MS over the short term and may exacerbate underlying disease activity .
6856,METHODS,This is a Class I study demonstrating that clinical and imaging outcomes are no better or worse in patients with MS identified with venous outflow restriction who receive venous angioplasty compared to sham controls who do not receive angioplasty .
6857,METHODS,This study also includes a Class IV phase 1 study of safety in 10 patients receiving the angioplasty procedure .
6858,BACKGROUND,"Previous efforts such as Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders ( ACOVE ) provide quality indicators for assessing the care of elderly patients , but thus far little has been done to leverage this knowledge to improve care for these patients ."
6859,BACKGROUND,We describe a clinical decision support system to improve general practitioner ( GP ) adherence to ACOVE quality indicators and a protocol for investigating impact on GPs ' adherence to the rules .
6860,METHODS,We propose two randomized controlled trials among a group of Dutch GP teams on adherence to ACOVE quality indicators .
6861,METHODS,"In both trials a clinical decision support system provides un-intrusive feedback appearing as a color-coded , dynamically updated , list of items needing attention ."
6862,METHODS,The first trial pertains to real-time automatically verifiable rules .
6863,METHODS,"The second trial concerns non-automatically verifiable rules ( adherence can not be established by the clinical decision support system itself , but the GPs report whether they will adhere to the rules ) ."
6864,METHODS,"In both trials we will randomize teams of GPs caring for the same patients into two groups , A and B. For the automatically verifiable rules , group A GPs receive support only for a specific inter-related subset of rules , and group B GPs receive support only for the remainder of the rules ."
6865,METHODS,"For non-automatically verifiable rules , group A GPs receive feedback framed as actions with positive consequences , and group B GPs receive feedback framed as inaction with negative consequences ."
6866,METHODS,GPs indicate whether they adhere to non-automatically verifiable rules .
6867,METHODS,"In both trials , the main outcome measure is mean adherence , automatically derived or self-reported , to the rules ."
6868,CONCLUSIONS,"We relied on active end-user involvement in selecting the rules to support , and on a model for providing feedback displayed as color-coded real-time messages concerning the patient visiting the GP at that time , without interrupting the GP 's workflow with pop-ups ."
6869,CONCLUSIONS,"While these aspects are believed to increase clinical decision support system acceptance and its impact on adherence to the selected clinical rules , systems with these properties have not yet been evaluated ."

6883,OBJECTIVE,To investigate whether providing sonographic ( US ) / MRI fusion images will enhance the ability of medical students and radiology residents to identify MSK anatomy on sonograms alone .
6884,METHODS,Medical students ( n = 31 ) and radiology residents ( n = 23 ) were each randomly divided into two groups : Group A and Group B. Subjects in Group A were shown 10 MSK sonograms with arrows pointing to a specific anatomic structure or anatomic region .
6885,METHODS,Subjects in Group B were shown the exact same 10 annotated sonograms as Group A as well as an additional fusion image consisting of an MRI of the same anatomy in the same plane fused with the sonogram without arrows .
6886,METHODS,Sonograms and MRI were obtained from adult patients who consented to have their images used .
6887,METHODS,"The anatomic regions included the shoulder , hip , and pelvis ."
6888,METHODS,Both groups were given the same 10-question multiple choice examination to identify the anatomic structure that the arrow was marking on the sonogram .
6889,METHODS,The transducer 's location was given for every question .
6890,METHODS,One minute was allowed to answer each question .
6891,METHODS,The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess if there was a difference between Group A and Group B in both the medical student and the radiology resident cohorts .
6892,RESULTS,Medical students : subjects in Group A ( n = 16 ) gave the correct answers in 33.8 % of the cases ( 54/160 ) .
6893,RESULTS,Subjects in Group B ( n = 15 ) gave correct answers in 26.0 % of the cases ( 39/150 ) ( p value < 0.110 ) .

6907,METHODS,Relevant inclusion criteria are age over 18years and waiting for penetrating or endothelial lamellar keratoplasty .
6908,METHODS,The most important exclusion criteria are abuse of medication and/or drugs and an anticipated waiting time for an HLA match longer than 6months .
6909,METHODS,"After randomisation , patients either receive a HLA-matched graft ( experimental intervention ) or a random graft ( control intervention ) ."
6910,METHODS,The calculated sample size is 620 patients .
6911,METHODS,The trial started in 2009 with a recruitment period of 24months .
6912,METHODS,A total of 654 patients were included during this time .
6913,CONCLUSIONS,The primary goal of FANCY is to assess whether histocompatibility matching is feasible and effective in the broad clinical routine .
6914,CONCLUSIONS,"However , during the course of the trial , the landscape of keratoplasty changed due to the rise of Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty ( DMEK ) ."
6915,CONCLUSIONS,"Nowadays , immune reactions are confined mostly to the ` high-risk ' subgroups ."
6916,CONCLUSIONS,"If we would design FANCY in 2014 , we would narrow down the inclusion criteria to include only the high risk patients and accept longer waiting times for a matching donor here ."
6917,BACKGROUND,The unique identifying number of the FANCY trial is NCT00810472 .
6918,OBJECTIVE,We tested the impact of banning tobacco displays and posting graphic health warning signs at the point of sale ( POS ) .
6919,METHODS,"We designed 3 variations of the tobacco product display ( open , enclosed [ not visible ] , enclosed with pro-tobacco ads ) and 2 variations of the warning sign ( present vs absent ) with virtual store software ."
6920,METHODS,"In December 2011 and January 2012 , we randomized a national convenience sample of 1216 adult smokers and recent quitters to 1 of 6 store conditions and gave them a shopping task ."
6921,METHODS,"We tested for the main effects of the enclosed display , the sign , and their interaction on urge to smoke and tobacco purchase attempts ."
6922,RESULTS,"The enclosed display significantly lowered current smokers ' ( B = -7.05 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = -13.20 , -0.91 ; P < .05 ) and recent quitters ' ( = -6.00 , 95 % CI = -11.00 , -1.00 ; P < .01 ) urge to smoke and current smokers ' purchase attempts ( adjusted odds ratio = 0.06 ; 95 % CI = 0.03 , 0.11 ; P < .01 ) ."
6923,RESULTS,The warning sign had no significant main effect on study outcomes or interaction with enclosed display .
6924,CONCLUSIONS,These data show that POS tobacco displays influence purchase behavior .
6925,CONCLUSIONS,Banning them may reduce cues to smoke and unplanned tobacco purchases .
6926,BACKGROUND,Topical corticosteroids are the most common first-line treatment for psoriasis .
6927,BACKGROUND,"Tachyphylaxis , a decreased response to treatment with repetitive application of the drug , is a controversial phenomenon associated with topical corticosteroid treatment ."

6934,RESULTS,Twenty patients were enrolled .
6935,RESULTS,No difference in time to clearance ( P = .88 ) or time to recurrence ( P = .92 ) of the treated plaques was found between phases 1 and 2A .
6936,RESULTS,"Percentage of improvement was higher in phase 2A compared with phase 1 ( 89.4 % , P < .05 vs 71 % , P < .05 ) , as a result of reduction of vehicle effect ."
6937,RESULTS,"In phase 2B , a greater improvement was found for previously corticosteroid-treated plaques ."
6938,CONCLUSIONS,Limitations are small sample size and 1 corticosteroid tested .
6939,CONCLUSIONS,No evidence of tachyphylaxis to the topical corticosteroid halobetasol 0.05 % ointment treatment in patients with plaque psoriasis was found .
6940,BACKGROUND,"A new , highly filled primer is currently marketed as a fluoride delivery system effective in reducing white spot lesions in orthodontic patients ."
6941,BACKGROUND,"However , no studies in the literature support this claim ."
6942,BACKGROUND,The purpose of this in-vivo study was to investigate the retention and the efficacy of this primer in reducing the formation of white spot lesions .
6943,METHODS,"In each patient for whom premolar extractions were planned ( n = 22 ) , 1 premolar was randomly chosen as the experimental tooth for the application of the fluoride delivery system ( Opal Seal ; Ultradent Products , South Jordan , Utah ) , and the contralateral tooth was assigned as the control to receive the standard treatment ( Transbond XT ; 3M Unitek , Monrovia , Calif ) ."
6944,METHODS,"After the bonding procedures , separators were placed around the premolar brackets to encourage plaque retention over 8 weeks ."
6945,METHODS,"After the extractions , the tooth surfaces were evaluated visually and with microhardness techniques for demineralization ."
6946,METHODS,Primer retention was also investigated .
6947,RESULTS,There were no statistically significant differences in the numbers of white spot lesions between the 2 groups .
6948,RESULTS,The primer retention was calculated as 50 % .
6949,CONCLUSIONS,The results indicated no significant difference between the efficacies of the fluoride-releasing primer and the control primer in reducing demineralization over the duration of the study .
6950,OBJECTIVE,We compared the outcomes of patients treated with everolimus-eluting stents ( EES ) versus paclitaxel-eluting stents ( PES ) at 3 years from the large-scale randomized SPIRIT IV trial .
6951,BACKGROUND,SPIRIT IV is the largest randomized trial comparing the outcomes of EES and PES .
6952,BACKGROUND,The present report represents the final long-term follow-up analysis from this study .
6953,METHODS,"A total of 3,687 patients were randomized 2:1 to EES or PES , stratified by presence of diabetes mellitus and lesion characteristics ."

6957,RESULTS,"The incidence of death or MI was 5.9 % versus 9.1 % , respectively ( HR 0.67 [ 0.52-0 .85 ] , P = .001 ) , and there was a 64 % reduction in stent thrombosis ( Academic Research Consortium definite or probable definition ) with EES ( 0.59 % vs 1.60 % , HR 0.36 [ 0.18-0 .72 ] , P = .003 ) ."
6958,RESULTS,"The difference in target lesion revascularization at 3 years did not reach statistical significance ( 6.2 % vs 7.8 % , respectively , HR 0.78 [ 0.60-1 .01 ] , P = .06 ) ."
6959,RESULTS,"There was no significant interaction between treatment allocation and any of the subgroups , including diabetes ."
6960,CONCLUSIONS,"When compared with PES , EES provides durable and significant reduction in TLF , especially due to its enhanced safety profile , with lower rates of death or MI and stent thrombosis up to 3 years ."
6961,OBJECTIVE,The development of minimally invasive surgical techniques is driven by the quest for better patient outcomes .
6962,OBJECTIVE,"There is some evidence for the use of minimally invasive surgery for degenerative lumbar spine stenosis ( LSS ) , but there are currently no studies comparing outcomes with matched controls ."
6963,OBJECTIVE,The object of this study was to compare outcomes following minimally invasive unilateral laminectomy for bilateral decompression ( ULBD ) to a standard `` open '' laminectomy for LSS .
6964,METHODS,"The authors conducted a prospective , 1:1 randomized trial comparing ULBD to open laminectomy for degenerative LSS ."
6965,METHODS,"The study enrolled 79 patients between 2007 and 2009 , and adequate data for analysis were available in 54 patients ( 27 in each arm of the study ) ."
6966,METHODS,"Patient demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics were recorded and clinical outcomes were obtained using pre - and postoperative Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) scores , visual analog scale ( VAS ) scores for leg pain , patient satisfaction index scores , and postoperative 12-Item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-12 ) scores ."
6967,RESULTS,Significant improvements were observed in ODI and VAS scores for both open and ULBD interventions ( p < 0.001 for both groups using either score ) .
6968,RESULTS,"In addition , the ULBD-treated patients had a significantly better mean improvement in the VAS scores ( p = 0.013 ) but not the ODI scores ( p = 0.055 ) compared with patients in the open-surgery group ."
6969,RESULTS,"ULBD-treated patients had a significantly shorter length of postoperative hospital stay ( 55.1 vs. 100.8 hours , p = 0.0041 ) and time to mobilization ( 15.6 vs. 33.3 hours , p < 0.001 ) and were more likely to not use opioids for postoperative pain ( 51.9 % vs. 15.4 % , p = 0.046 ) ."
6970,CONCLUSIONS,"Based on short-term follow-up , microscopic ULBD is as effective as open decompression in improving function ( ODI score ) , with the additional benefits of a significantly greater decrease in pain ( VAS score ) , postoperative recovery time , time to mobilization , and opioid use ."
6971,OBJECTIVE,The benefit of adding sciatic nerve block ( SNB ) to femoral nerve block to improve analgesia after total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) is uncertain .
6972,OBJECTIVE,We hypothesized that the effective duration of single-injection SNB is too short to improve postoperative analgesia and that this contributes to conflicting results on the efficacy of SNB after TKA .
6973,OBJECTIVE,We evaluated this hypothesis in a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial .
6974,METHODS,Sixty patients undergoing TKA were randomly allocated to a continuous SNB group or a single-injection SNB group .
6975,METHODS,All patients received femoral nerve block ( 0.5 % ropivacaine 20 mL ) and SNB ( 0.2 % ropivacaine 20 mL ) and catheters were inserted into both peripheral nerve block sites before surgery .
6976,METHODS,Both groups received continuous femoral nerve block and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia with morphine .
6977,METHODS,Continuous SNB ( 0.2 % ropivacaine 5 mL/h ; continuous SNB group ) or sham continuous SNB ( 0.9 % normal saline 5 mL/h ; single-injection SNB group ) was provided after surgery .
6978,METHODS,The primary outcome was total morphine consumption for 48 hours after surgery .
6979,RESULTS,"Total morphine consumption in the 48-hour period after surgery was significantly lower in the continuous SNB group compared with the single-injection SNB group [ 4.9 ( 5.9 ) vs 9.7 ( 9.5 ) mg , P = 0.002 ] ."
6980,RESULTS,Visual analog scale pain scores at rest were also significantly lower in the continuous SNB group ( P = 0.035 ) .
6981,CONCLUSIONS,The combination of continuous femoral and SNB provides a superior opioid sparing effect and improves analgesia after TKA .
6982,OBJECTIVE,Direct evidence for the effects of vegetable intake on weight loss is qualified .
6983,OBJECTIVE,The study aimed to assess the effect of higher vegetable consumption on weight loss .
6984,METHODS,A single blind parallel controlled trial was conducted with 120 overweight adults ( mean body mass index = 29.98 kg/m ( 2 ) ) randomised to two energy deficit healthy diet advice groups differing only by doubling the serving ( portion ) sizes of vegetables in the comparator group .
6985,METHODS,Data were analysed as intention-to-treat using a linear mixed model .
6986,METHODS,Spearmans rho bivariate was used to explore relationships between percentage energy from vegetables and weight loss .
6987,RESULTS,"After 12 months , the study sample lost 6.55.2 kg ( P < 0.001 time ) with no difference between groups ( P > 0.05 interaction ) ."
6988,RESULTS,"Both groups increased vegetable intake and lost weight in the first 3 months , and the change in weight was significantly correlated with higher proportions of energy consumed as vegetables ( rho = -0.217 , P = 0.024 ) ."
6989,RESULTS,"Fasting glucose , insulin and triglyceride levels decreased ( P < 0.001 time ) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased ( P < 0.001 time ) , with no difference between groups ."
6990,RESULTS,"Weight loss was sustained for 12 months by both groups , but the comparator group reported greater hunger satisfaction ( P = 0.005 ) ."
6991,CONCLUSIONS,"Advice to consume a healthy low-energy diet leads to sustained weight loss , with reductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors regardless of an emphasis on more vegetables ."
6992,CONCLUSIONS,"In the short term , consuming a higher proportion of the dietary energy as vegetables may support a greater weight loss and the dietary pattern appears sustainable ."

7006,BACKGROUND,"Preliminary evidence suggests intravenous ketamine has rapid effects on suicidal cognition , making it an attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide ."
7007,BACKGROUND,"In the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine using an anesthetic control condition , we tested ketamine 's acute effects on explicit suicidal cognition and a performance-based index of implicit suicidal cognition ( Implicit Association Test ; IAT ) previously linked to suicidal behavior ."
7008,METHODS,"Symptomatic patients with treatment-resistant unipolar major depression ( inadequate response to 3 antidepressants ) were assessed using a composite index of explicit suicidal ideation ( Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation , Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale suicide item , Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms suicide item ) and the IAT to assess suicidality implicitly ."
7009,METHODS,"Measures were taken at baseline and 24 hr following a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine ( n = 36 ) or midazolam ( n = 21 ) , a psychoactive placebo agent selected for its similar , rapid anesthetic effects ."
7010,METHODS,"Twenty four hours postinfusion , explicit suicidal cognition was significantly reduced in the ketamine but not the midazolam group ."
7011,RESULTS,"Fifty three percent of ketamine-treated patients scored zero on all three explicit suicide measures at 24 hr , compared with 24 % of the midazolam group ( ( 2 ) = 4.6 ; P = .03 ) ."
7012,RESULTS,Implicit associations between self - and escape-related words were reduced following ketamine ( P = .01 ; d = .58 ) but not midazolam ( P = .68 ; d = .09 ) .
7013,RESULTS,"Ketamine-specific decreases in explicit suicidal cognition were largest in patients with elevated suicidal cognition at baseline , and were mediated by decreases in nonsuicide-related depressive symptoms ."
7014,CONCLUSIONS,Intravenous ketamine produces rapid reductions in suicidal cognition over and above active placebo .
7015,CONCLUSIONS,Further study is warranted to test ketamine 's antisuicidal effects in higher-risk samples .

7242,OBJECTIVE,We previously demonstrated that 48 % of patients with pain at sites of previously irradiated bone metastases benefit from reirradiation .
7243,OBJECTIVE,It is unknown whether alleviating pain also improves patient perception of quality of life ( QOL ) .
7244,METHODS,"We used the database of a randomized trial comparing radiation treatment dose fractionation schedules to evaluate whether response , determined using the International Consensus Endpoint ( ICE ) and Brief Pain Inventory pain score ( BPI-PS ) , is associated with patient perception of benefit , as measured using the European Organisation for Resesarch and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 ( QLQ-C30 ) and functional interference scale of the BPI ( BPI-FI ) ."
7245,METHODS,Evaluable patients completed baseline and 2-month follow-up assessments .

7277,RESULTS,"The relationship between statin use and total hip BMD change was robust to adjustment of age , sex , race and smoking status ( P = 0.02 ) and strengthened by inclusion of baseline ( P = 0.01 ) and week 48 change in soluble tumour necrosis factor - receptor ( sTNFR ) -1 ( P = 0.009 ) ."
7278,RESULTS,"Relative increases in total body , trunk and limb fat were similar between statin and placebo arms ( P0 .58 ) ."
7279,RESULTS,"Although a significant gain in leg lean mass was seen in the statin arm , this was not significantly different compared with placebo ( P = 0.36 ) ."
7280,CONCLUSIONS,"The improvements seen in total hip BMD after 48 weeks of rosuvastatin therapy support further potential benefits of statin therapy in HIV , beyond a reduction of cardiovascular risk ."
7281,BACKGROUND,Mobilization-Observation-Behavior-Intensity-Dementia-2 ( MOBID-2 ) pain scale is a staff-administered pain tool for patients with dementia .
7282,BACKGROUND,"This study explores MOBID-2 's test-retest reliability , measurement error and responsiveness to change ."
7283,METHODS,Analyses are based upon data from a cluster randomized trial including 352 patients with advanced dementia from 18 Norwegian nursing homes .
7284,METHODS,"Test-retest reliability between baseline and week 2 ( n = 163 ) , and weeks 2 and 4 ( n = 159 ) was examined in patients not expected to change ( controls ) , using intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC2 .1 ) , standard error of measurement ( SEM ) and smallest detectable change ( SDC ) ."
7285,METHODS,Responsiveness was examined by testing six priori-formulated hypotheses about the association between change scores on MOBID-2 and other outcome measures .
7286,RESULTS,ICCs of the total MOBID-2 scores were 0.81 ( 0-2 weeks ) and 0.85 ( 2-4 weeks ) .
7287,RESULTS,"SEM and SDC were 1.9 and 3.1 ( 0-2 weeks ) and 1.4 and 2.3 ( 2-4 weeks ) , respectively ."
7288,RESULTS,Five out of six hypotheses were confirmed : MOBID-2 discriminated ( p < 0.001 ) between change in patients with and without a stepwise protocol for treatment of pain ( SPTP ) .
7289,RESULTS,"Moderate association ( r = 0.35 ) was demonstrated with Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory , and no association with Mini-Mental State Examination , Functional Assessment Staging and Activity of Daily Living ."
7290,RESULTS,Expected associations between change scores of MOBID-2 and Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Nursing Home version were not confirmed .
7291,CONCLUSIONS,The SEM and SDC in connection with the MOBID-2 pain scale indicate that the instrument is responsive to a decrease in pain after a SPTP .
7292,CONCLUSIONS,Satisfactory test-retest reliability across test periods was demonstrated .
7293,CONCLUSIONS,Change scores 3 on total and subscales are clinically relevant and are beyond measurement error .
7294,OBJECTIVE,To test whether a brief mindfulness meditation training intervention buffers self-reported psychological and neuroendocrine responses to the Trier Social Stress Test ( TSST ) in young adult volunteers .
7295,OBJECTIVE,A second objective evaluates whether pre-existing levels of dispositional mindfulness moderate the effects of brief mindfulness meditation training on stress reactivity .
7296,METHODS,Sixty-six ( N = 66 ) participants were randomly assigned to either a brief 3-day ( 25-min per day ) mindfulness meditation training or an analytic cognitive training control program .
7297,METHODS,All participants completed a standardized laboratory social-evaluative stress challenge task ( the TSST ) following the third mindfulness meditation or cognitive training session .
7298,METHODS,"Measures of psychological ( stress perceptions ) and biological ( salivary cortisol , blood pressure ) stress reactivity were collected during the social evaluative stress-challenge session ."
7299,RESULTS,"Brief mindfulness meditation training reduced self-reported psychological stress reactivity but increased salivary cortisol reactivity to the TSST , relative to the cognitive training comparison program ."
7300,RESULTS,Participants who were low in pre-existing levels of dispositional mindfulness and then received mindfulness meditation training had the greatest cortisol reactivity to the TSST .
7301,RESULTS,No significant main or interactive effects were observed for systolic or diastolic blood pressure reactivity to the TSST .
7302,CONCLUSIONS,"The present study provides an initial indication that brief mindfulness meditation training buffers self-reported psychological stress reactivity , but also increases cortisol reactivity to social evaluative stress ."
7303,CONCLUSIONS,"This pattern may indicate that initially brief mindfulness meditation training fosters greater active coping efforts , resulting in reduced psychological stress appraisals and greater cortisol reactivity during social evaluative stressors ."

7361,BACKGROUND,Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) is commonly performed using a tourniquet .
7362,BACKGROUND,"However , some studies have reported that several complications were associated with the use of a tourniquet in TKA ."
7363,BACKGROUND,In this study we investigate whether the limited use of a tourniquet in TKA would reduce complications and facilitate postoperative recovery .
7364,METHODS,"Sixty patients were randomly divided into two groups ( 30 cases/group ) : group A using the tourniquet throughout the surgical procedure , and group B using the tourniquet starting from the cementation to the completion of the procedure ."
7365,METHODS,"Operation time , total measured blood loss , and incidence of complications were all recorded ."
7366,RESULTS,"There was no significant difference in operation time , total measured blood loss , and hemoglobin concentration between the two groups ."
7367,RESULTS,Incidence of postoperative complications in group B was significantly decreased in comparison to that in group A.
7368,RESULTS,The limb circumference at 10 cm above the superior patellar pole or below the inferior patellar pole and the pain score in group B were significantly decreased compared with that in group A at any time point .
7369,RESULTS,Range of motion in group B was significantly increased at three and 5 days postoperatively in comparison to that in group A.
7370,CONCLUSIONS,The limited use of a tourniquet in TKA provides the benefit of decreased limb swelling and knee joint pain while not compromising the operation time or blood loss and recovery .

7373,BACKGROUND,The relation between visceral fat accumulation and development of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders has been demonstrated .
7374,BACKGROUND,The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between a new ultrasound visceral fat thickness ( VFT ) measurement and clinical and anthropometric data in a consecutive series of obese patients .
7375,METHODS,Fifty-five consecutive male obese patients underwent ultrasound evaluation and metabolic and anthropometric parameters determination at baseline and after 3 weeks of a very low-calorie diet ( VLCD ) therapy .
7376,METHODS,"The new ultrasound measurement , the thickness of the fat between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery ( AMFT ) , was determined along with the maximum thickness of preperitoneal fat and the global VFT ."
7377,RESULTS,"AMFT showed a better correlation than VFT and preperitoneal fat with all anthropometric and metabolic parameters , both at baseline and after VLCD regimen ."
7378,RESULTS,"At baseline , patients in the middle and high AMFT and VFT tertiles had a significantly higher prevalence of metabolic diseases with respect to AMFT and VFT low tertile patients , whereas after VLCD period , AMFT only showed significant difference within tertiles ."
7379,RESULTS,"The odds ratios for the various metabolic diseases were higher in the middle and high AMFT tertiles than those in the middle and high VFT tertiles , remaining significant after adjustment for age , body mass index and VLCD regimen only in the middle and high AMFT tertiles ."
7380,CONCLUSIONS,The ultrasonographic AMFT evaluation is strongly correlated to the presence of metabolic syndrome and could be a valuable tool to predict metabolic diseases and associated cardiovascular risks in men .

7518,METHODS,"In both studies , patients were randomly assigned to receive either lumacaftor ( 600 mg once daily or 400 mg every 12 hours ) in combination with ivacaftor ( 250 mg every 12 hours ) or matched placebo for 24 weeks ."
7519,METHODS,The primary end point was the absolute change from baseline in the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) at week 24 .
7520,RESULTS,A total of 1108 patients underwent randomization and received study drug .
7521,RESULTS,The mean baseline FEV1 was 61 % of the predicted value .
7522,RESULTS,"In both studies , there were significant improvements in the primary end point in both lumacaftor-ivacaftor dose groups ; the difference between active treatment and placebo with respect to the mean absolute improvement in the percentage of predicted FEV1 ranged from 2.6 to 4.0 percentage points ( P < 0.001 ) , which corresponded to a mean relative treatment difference of 4.3 to 6.7 % ( P < 0.001 ) ."
7523,RESULTS,Pooled analyses showed that the rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 30 to 39 % lower in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor groups than in the placebo group ; the rate of events leading to hospitalization or the use of intravenous antibiotics was lower in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor groups as well .
7524,RESULTS,The incidence of adverse events was generally similar in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor and placebo groups .
7525,RESULTS,The rate of discontinuation due to an adverse event was 4.2 % among patients who received lumacaftor-ivacaftor versus 1.6 % among those who received placebo .
7526,CONCLUSIONS,These data show that lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor provided a benefit for patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation .

7538,BACKGROUND,The efficacy of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is well documented .
7539,BACKGROUND,"However , due to relapse rates and side effects , hypnotherapy is gaining attention as an alternative treatment option ."
7540,BACKGROUND,"The aim of this one-center randomized study was to compare the efficacy of hypnotherapy alone , as well as hypnotherapy with nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) , to conventional NRT in patients hospitalized with a cardiac or pulmonary illness ."
7541,METHODS,We evaluated self-reported and biochemically verified 7-day prevalence smoking abstinence rates at 12 and 26 weeks post-hospitalization .
7542,METHODS,"Patients ( n = 164 ) were randomized into one of three counseling-based treatment groups : NRT for 30 days ( NRT ; n = 41 ) , a 90-min hypnotherapy session ( H ; n = 39 ) , and NRT with hypnotherapy ( HNRT ; n = 37 ) ."
7543,METHODS,Treatment groups were compared to a `` self-quit '' group of 35 patients who refused intervention .
7544,RESULTS,Hypnotherapy patients were more likely than NRT patients to be nonsmokers at 12 weeks ( 43.9 % vs. 28.2 % ; p = 0.14 ) and 26 weeks after hospitalization ( 36.6 % vs. 18.0 % ; p = 0.06 ) .
7545,RESULTS,Smoking abstinence rates in the HNRT group were similar to the H group .
7546,RESULTS,There was no difference in smoking abstinence rates at 26 weeks between `` self quit '' and participants in any of the treatment groups .

7549,OBJECTIVE,The current study investigated the effects of coaching as part of an emergent literacy professional development program to increase early childhood educators ' use of verbal references to print and phonological awareness during interactions with children .
7550,METHODS,Thirty-one educators and 4 children from each of their classrooms ( N = 121 ) were randomly assigned to an experimental group ( 21 hr of in-service workshops plus 5 coaching sessions ) and a comparison group ( workshops alone ) .
7551,METHODS,The in-service workshops included instruction on how to talk about print and phonological awareness during a post-story craft/writing activity .
7552,METHODS,All educators were video-recorded during a 15-min craft/writing activity with a small group of preschoolers at pretest and posttest .
7553,METHODS,All videotapes were transcribed and coded for verbal references to print and phonological awareness by the educators and children .
7554,RESULTS,"Although at posttest , there were no significant group differences in the educators ' or the children 's references to print as measured by rate per minute , both the educators and the children in the experimental group used a significantly higher rate per minute of references to phonological awareness relative to the comparison group ."
7555,CONCLUSIONS,Professional development that included coaching with a speech-language pathologist enabled educators and children to engage in more phonological awareness talk during this activity .
7556,BACKGROUND,"Varenicline , a partial agonist at 42 nicotinic receptors ( nAChRs ) aids smoking cessation by reducing craving ."
7557,BACKGROUND,Successful quitting may be associated with greater inhibitory control but the effectiveness of varenicline in this regard is unknown .
7558,OBJECTIVE,This study aimed to investigate the effect of varenicline on aspects of inhibitory control in smokers .
7559,METHODS,"A double-blind , placebo-controlled study investigating the effect of varenicline 1 mg ( or matched placebo ) in satiated and abstinent smokers ."
7560,METHODS,"Tests included Rapid Visual Information Processing ( RVIP ) , Stop-Signal ( SS ) , Prospective Memory ( PM ) and the Cambridge Gambling Task ( CGT ) ."
7561,RESULTS,Smoking enhanced RVIP accuracy and latency to respond .
7562,RESULTS,"Varenicline did not alter RVIP performance , nor the effect of smoking , suggesting that these effects were unrelated to 42 nAChRs ."
7563,RESULTS,"Smoking increased the number of errors during SS and increased the stop latency , indicating that smoking decreased inhibitory control ."
7564,RESULTS,"Varenicline partially mimicked this effect of smoking but also reduced the smoking-induced increase , indicating a role for 42 nAChRs ."
7565,RESULTS,"Likewise , smoking increased the number of points bet following a win during CGT and varenicline blocked this effect ."
7566,RESULTS,There was no effect of smoking or varenicline on PM target detection per se .
7567,RESULTS,"However , smoking protected the target detection rate in the ongoing task when a concurrent intention was introduced ."
7568,RESULTS,Varenicline improved response speed in both satiated and abstinent smokers .
7569,CONCLUSIONS,Some aspects of inhibitory control may be mediated by 42-related mechanisms and blockade of smoking-induced disinhibition may contribute towards the action of varenicline as an aid to smoking cessation .

7592,BACKGROUND,Most randomised clinical trials ( RCTs ) testing a new health service do not allow a run-in period of consolidation before evaluating the new approach .
7593,BACKGROUND,"Consequently , health professionals involved may feel insufficiently familiar or confident , or that new processes or systems that are integral to the service are insufficiently embedded in routine care prior to definitive evaluation in a RCT ."
7594,BACKGROUND,This study aimed to determine the optimal run-in period for a new physiotherapy-led telephone assessment and treatment service known as PhysioDirect and whether a run-in was needed prior to evaluating outcomes in an RCT .
7595,METHODS,The PhysioDirect trial assessed whether PhysioDirect was as effective as usual care .
7596,METHODS,"Prior to the main trial , a run-in of up to 12 weeks was permitted to facilitate physiotherapists to become confident in delivering the new service ."
7597,METHODS,Outcomes collected from the run-in and main trial were length of telephone calls within the PhysioDirect service and patients ' physical function ( SF-36v2 questionnaire ) and Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile v2 collected at baseline and six months .
7598,METHODS,Joinpoint regression determined how long it had taken call times to stabilise .
7599,METHODS,Analysis of covariance determined whether patients ' physical function at six months changed from the run-in to the main trial .
7600,RESULTS,Mean PhysioDirect call times ( minutes ) were higher in the run-in ( 31 ( SD : 12.6 ) ) than in the main trial ( 25 ( SD : 11.6 ) ) .
7601,RESULTS,"Each physiotherapist needed to answer 42 ( 95 % CI : 20,56 ) calls for their mean call time to stabilise at 25 minutes per call ; this took a minimum of seven weeks ."
7602,RESULTS,"For patients ' physical function , PhysioDirect was equally clinically effective as usual care during both the run-in ( 0.17 ( 95 % CI : -0.91,1.24 ) ) and main trial ( -0.01 ( 95 % CI : -0.80,0.79 ) ) ."
7603,CONCLUSIONS,A run-in was not needed in a large trial testing PhysioDirect services in terms of patient outcomes .
7604,CONCLUSIONS,A learning curve was evident in the process measure of telephone call length .
7605,CONCLUSIONS,This decreased during the run-in and stabilised prior to commencement of the main trial .
7606,CONCLUSIONS,Future trials should build in a run-in if it is anticipated that learning would have an effect on patient outcome .

7608,OBJECTIVE,Proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy has been shown to attenuate the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel .
7609,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to compare the antiplatelet effects of cilostazol versus clopidogrel in patients co-administered a PPI .
7610,METHODS,We enrolled PPI-nave stented patients treated with standard clopidogrel and aspirin therapy for at least six months ( n = 100 ) .
7611,METHODS,The patients were randomly assigned to receive either cilostazol at a dose of 100mg twice daily ( CILO group ) or clopidogrel at a dose of 75mg daily ( CLPD group ) in addition to lansoprazole ( 30mg daily ) .
7612,METHODS,The platelet aggregation ( PA ) determined using light transmittance aggregometry and the platelet reactivity index ( PRI ) obtained using a vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay were measured before randomization and at the 14-day follow-up visit .
7613,METHODS,The primary endpoint was the PRI value at follow-up .
7614,RESULTS,"At follow-up , the CLPD group showed similar values of PRI as the CILO group ( 66.914.0 % vs. 63.114.1 % ; mean difference : 3.9 % ; 95 % confidence interval of difference : -1.7 % to 9.4 % ; p = 0.174 ) ."
7615,RESULTS,"However , the 6g/mL collagen - and 0.5 mg/mL arachidonic acid-induced PA values in the CLPD group were higher than those observed in the CILO group ( mean differences : 9.8 % to 11.1 % ; all p values 0.001 ) ."
7616,RESULTS,CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele carriage was the major contributing factor associated with the PRI level in the absence of lansoprazole treatment ( with a gene-dose effect ) ; this association was not observed in the subjects receiving lansoprazole co-administration in the CLPD group .
7617,CONCLUSIONS,"During lansoprazole co-administration , cilostazol treatment achieves a more favorable platelet function profile than clopidogrel therapy ."
7618,CONCLUSIONS,The use of combination treatment with cilostazol and aspirin deserves further attention with respect to the management of stable stented patients requiring PPI co-administration .
7619,OBJECTIVE,This study examined the potential emotional sequelae following self-reported mild head injury ( MHI ; e.g. ` altered state of consciousness ' [ ASC ] ) in university students with a particular focus on arousal status and responsivity to experimental manipulation of arousal .
7620,METHODS,A quasi-experimental design ( n = 91 ) was used to examine arousal status ( self-reported and physiological indices ) and response to manipulated arousal ( i.e. induced psychosocial stress/activation ; reduced activation/relaxation ) between persons who acknowledged prior MHI and persons with no-MHI .
7621,RESULTS,University students who self-reported MHI were physiologically under-aroused and less responsive to stressors ( both laboratory and environmental ) compared to their no-MHI cohort .
7622,RESULTS,"Those with reported loss of consciousness demonstrated the most attenuated emotional arousal responses ( i.e. flattened electrodermal responsivity ) relative to those with only a reported ASC , followed by those with no-MHI ."
7623,CONCLUSIONS,The under-arousal in traumatic brain injury has been hypothesized to be associated with ventromedial prefrontal cortex disruption .
7624,CONCLUSIONS,This under-arousal may be mirrored in persons who self-report experiencing subtle head trauma .
7625,CONCLUSIONS,Students who reported MHI may be less able to physiologically respond and/or cognitively appraise stressful experiences as compared to their no-MHI cohort ; and experience subtle persistent consequences despite the subtle nature of the reported head trauma .

7640,BACKGROUND,Several long-acting injectable ( LAI ) second-generation antipsychotics are now available for the management of schizophrenia .
7641,BACKGROUND,"As patients with schizophrenia frequently present with diverse and challenging symptoms , it is important to understand the effects of antipsychotics in treating these different symptom subgroups and the timing of these responses ."
7642,METHODS,"For this review , data from two randomized , double-blind trials were analyzed in respect to the onset and persistence of effects on several measures of psychopathology ( as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [ PANSS ] ) after treatment with LAI paliperidone palmitate ( PP ) ( NCT00590577 and NCT00589914 ) ."
7643,CONCLUSIONS,Symptom reductions from baseline with PP were significant by day 4 for all five PANSS factors in both studies .
7644,CONCLUSIONS,Some effects may have been driven by the presence or absence of a placebo response .
7645,CONCLUSIONS,A significant effect for PP versus placebo was observed for all major symptom domains for one or more doses of PP during the first month of treatment .
7646,CONCLUSIONS,"Once established , most ( but not all ) significant responses persisted to the end point ."
7647,CONCLUSIONS,Similar improvements were observed in PANSS scores with PP and oral risperidone .
7648,CONCLUSIONS,"Dose-dependent trends were observed for the effect of PP on positive , negative and uncontrolled hostility/excitement symptoms ."
7649,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of low-level laser therapy and ultrasound therapy in the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome .
7650,METHODS,Thirty one patients with subacromial impingement syndrome were randomly assigned to low-level laser therapy group ( n = 16 ) and ultrasound therapy group ( n = 15 ) .
7651,METHODS,Study participants received 10 treatment sessions of low-level laser therapy or ultrasound therapy over a period of two-consecutive weeks ( five days per week ) .
7652,METHODS,"Outcome measures ( visual analogue pain scale , Shoulder Pain and Disability Index - SPADI - , patient 's satisfactory level and sleep interference score ) were assessed before treatment and at the 1st and 3rd months after treatment ."
7653,METHODS,All patients were analyzed by the intent-to-treat principle .

7676,OBJECTIVE,"This research was conducted to examine changes in self self-efficacy , ( the perception/belief that one can competently cope with a challenging situation ) in multiple sclerosis clients following a series of massage therapy treatments ."
7677,METHODS,This small practical trial investigated the effects of a pragmatic treatment protocol using a prospective randomized pretest posttest waitlist control design .
7678,METHODS,"Self-Efficacy scores were obtained before the first treatment , mid-treatment series , after the last treatment in the series , four weeks after the final treatment and again eight weeks after the final treatment had been received ."
7679,METHODS,The intervention involved a series of weekly one hour therapeutic massage treatments conducted over eight weeks and a subsequent eight week follow up period .
7680,METHODS,All treatments were delivered by supervised student therapists in the final term of their two year massage therapy program .
7681,METHODS,"Self-Efficacy [ SE ] was the outcome for the study , measured using the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy survey [ MSSE ] ."
7682,METHODS,Descriptive statistics for SE scores were assessed and inferential analysis involved the testing of between group differences at each of the measurement points noted above .
7683,RESULTS,"Statistically significant improvement in self-efficacy was noted between treatment ( n = 8 ) and control ( n = 7 ) groups at mid treatment series ( t = 2.32 ; p < 0.02 ) , post treatment series ( t = 1.81 ; p < 0.05 ) and at four week follow up ( t = 2.24 ; p < 0.02 ) ."
7684,RESULTS,At the eight week follow up self-efficacy scores had decreased and there was no statistically significant difference between groups ( t = 0.87 ; p < 0.2 ) .
7685,CONCLUSIONS,"Study results support previous findings indicating that massage therapy increases the self-efficacy of clients with multiple sclerosis , potentially resulting in a better overall adjustment to the disease and an improvement in psycho-emotional state ."
7686,CONCLUSIONS,The increase in self-efficacy after 4 weeks of treatment suggests that positive response occurs more rapidly that was previously demonstrated .
7687,CONCLUSIONS,"The improvement in self-efficacy endured 4 weeks after the end of the treatment series , which suggests that massage therapy may have longer term effects on self-efficacy that were not previously noted ."
7688,CONCLUSIONS,Lack of inter group difference at the eight week follow up reinforces the notion that on-going treatment is required in order to maintain the positive changes observed .
7689,BACKGROUND,"Drug abuse remains a serious problem in China , and has become a major threat to public health and social security ."
7690,BACKGROUND,"Since the issuance and enforcement of the new Anti-Drug law in 2008 , the community has become the primary site for drug rehabilitation ."
7691,BACKGROUND,"However , the attitudes of members in community toward the people with drug use disorders are unclear ."
7692,METHODS,A random sample of household respondents was studied in two communities in Hunan province in China .
7693,METHODS,A total of 848 individuals participated ( response rate 83.7 % ) .
7694,METHODS,"Respondents initially were asked a set of questions about their knowledge about dug dependence , and then were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 vignette conditions ."
7695,METHODS,"Three vignettes described different type of drug dependence meeting diagnostic criteria , and the fourth depicted a `` normal person . ''"
7696,RESULTS,Poor knowledge of drug dependence was common .
7697,RESULTS,Negative attitudes towards drug dependent people were widespread .
7698,RESULTS,"Most respondents believed that drug dependence was caused by the person 's own weak will ( 82.0 % ) and own hedonistic lifestyle ( 81.3 % ) , and should be punished as illegal behavior ( 80.4 % ) ."
7699,RESULTS,"The vast majority labeled the person with drug dependence as an addict , rated them as having undesirable characteristics , and expressed a strong desire for social distance ."
7700,RESULTS,There were few socio-demographic predictors of both poor knowledge and negative attitudes .
7701,CONCLUSIONS,A community-based rehabilitation program in China should take into account the widespread stigmatization of people with drug dependence .

7871,BACKGROUND,Spatial neglect is a frequent and debilitating consequence of acquired brain injury and currently has no widely accepted standard of care .
7872,BACKGROUND,"While previous interventions for spatial neglect have targeted patients ' overt spatial deficits ( e.g. , reduced contralesional visual scanning ) , far fewer have directly targeted patients ' non-spatial deficits ( e.g. , sustained attention deficits ) ."
7873,BACKGROUND,"Considering that non-spatial deficits have shown to be highly predictive of long-term disability , we developed a novel computer based training program that targets both sustained ( tonic ) and moment-to-moment ( phasic ) aspects of non-spatial attention ( Tonic and Phasic Alertness Training , TAPAT ) ."
7874,BACKGROUND,Preliminary studies demonstrate that TAPAT is safe and effective in improving both spatial and non-spatial attention deficits in the post-acute recovery phase in neglect patients .
7875,BACKGROUND,"The purpose of the current trial ( referred to as the REmediation of SPatial Neglect or RESPONSE trial ) is to compare TAPAT to an active control training condition , include a larger sample of patients , and assess both cognitive and functional outcomes ."
7876,METHODS,"We will employ a multi-site , longitudinal , blinded randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) design with a target sample of 114 patients with spatial neglect ."
7877,METHODS,"Patients will either perform , at their home , the experimental TAPAT training program or an active control computer games condition for thirty minutes/day , five days a week , over three months ."
7878,METHODS,"Patients will be assessed on a battery of cognitive and functional outcomes on three occasions : a ) immediately before training , b ) within forty-eight hours post completion of total training , and c ) after a three-month no-contact period post completion of total training , to assess the longevity of potential training effects ."
7879,CONCLUSIONS,"The strengths of this protocol are that it tests an innovative , in-home administered treatment that targets a fundamental deficit in neglect , employs highly sensitive computer-based assessments of cognition as well as functional outcomes , and incorporates a large sample size ( relative to other neglect treatment studies ) in an RCT design ."

7934,BACKGROUND,Evidence suggests that inflammation precedes blood pressure ( BP ) elevation and may contribute to incident hypertension .
7935,BACKGROUND,Angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) may reduce inflammation .
7936,BACKGROUND,"We analyzed WBCC trends in TRial Of Preventing HYpertension ( TROPHY ) to determine if this inflammatory marker predicted incident hypertension in prehypertensive individuals and whether randomized assignment to the ARB candesartan ( 391 individuals ) for 2 years , lowered WBCC compared with placebo-treated controls ( 381 individuals ) ."
7937,METHODS,A new analysis of TROPHY trial data .
7938,RESULTS,"In the total population , baseline BMI correlated with WBCC ( r = 0.185 , P < 0.0001 ) , neutrophils ( r = 0.135 , P < 0.001 ) and lymphocytes ( r = 0.204 , P < 0.0001 ) ."

8004,RESULTS,"Aneurysms were categorized into 1 of 6 groups : intradural internal carotid artery aneurysms , vertebral artery ( VA ) aneurysms ( including the posterior inferior cerebellar artery ) , basilar trunk or basilar apex aneurysms , middle cerebral artery aneurysms , pericallosal aneurysms , and anterior communicating artery aneurysms ."
8005,RESULTS,Twenty-nine patients with nonaneurysmal SAH were excluded .
8006,RESULTS,"Patients with pericallosal aneurysms had the least average maximum clot burden ( 5.3 mm ) , compared with 6.4 mm for the group overall , but had the highest rate of symptomatic vasospasm ( 56 % vs 22 % overall , OR 4.9 , RR 2.7 , p = 0.026 ) ."
8007,RESULTS,Symptomatic vasospasm occurrence was tallied in patients with clinical deterioration attributable to delayed cerebral ischemia .
8008,RESULTS,There were no significant differences in maximum clot thickness between aneurysm sites .
8009,RESULTS,Middle cerebral artery aneurysms resulted in the thickest mean maximum clot ( 7.1 mm ) but rates of symptomatic and radiographic vasospasm in this group were statistically no different compared with the overall group .
8010,RESULTS,"Vertebral artery aneurysms had the worst 1-year modified Rankin scale ( mRS ) scores ( 3.0 vs 1.9 overall , respectively ; p = 0.0249 ) ."
8011,RESULTS,"A 1-year mRS score of 0-2 ( good outcome ) was found in 72 % of patients overall , but in only 50 % of those with pericallosal and VA aneurysms , and in 56 % of those with basilar artery aneurysms ( p = 0.0044 ) ."
8012,RESULTS,"Patients with stroke from vasospasm had higher mean clot thickness ( 9.71 vs 6.15 mm , p = 0.004 ) ."
8013,CONCLUSIONS,The location of a ruptured aneurysm minimally affects the maximum thickness of the SAH clot but is predictive of symptomatic vasospasm or clinical deterioration from delayed cerebral ischemia in pericallosal aneurysms .
8014,CONCLUSIONS,The worst 1-year mRS outcomes in this cohort of patients were noted in those with posterior circulation aneurysms or pericallosal artery aneurysms .
8015,CONCLUSIONS,Patients experiencing stroke had higher mean clot burden .
8016,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the short-term benefits of simple relaxation techniques in white-collar employees .
8017,METHODS,The study was a two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial .
8018,METHODS,"152 employees were randomly assigned to receive the 8-week programme ( N = 80 ) ( relaxation breathing and progressive muscle relaxation , twice a day ) or not ( wait-list group N = 72 ) ."
8019,METHODS,"Self-reported validated measures were used to evaluate perceived stress , health locus of control , job and lifestyle related variables ."
8020,METHODS,Saliva cortisol were also sampled and measured .
8021,METHODS,Adjusted mean changes on outcomes were estimated by linear mixed model analysis .
8022,METHODS,127 employees were finally analyzed ( 68 in the intervention and 59 in the control group ) .
8023,RESULTS,"Specific stress-related symptoms , psychological job demands and cortisol levels were found to be significantly decreased after 8-weeks in the intervention group ."
8024,RESULTS,The result was probably affected by the general socio-economic condition during the study period .
8025,RESULTS,"Cortisol levels were also significantly related with age , family situation , gender and sampling time ."
8026,CONCLUSIONS,Simple relaxation training ( diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation ) could benefit employees and it is strongly proposed that these and other similar techniques should be tested in various labour settings .
8027,BACKGROUND,Faecal short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) are produced by the gut microflora .
8028,BACKGROUND,"We have previously reported high faecal SCFA levels in children with coeliac disease ( CD ) , indicating alteration in gut microfloral metabolism ."
8029,BACKGROUND,Data accumulated over recent decades by us and others suggest that wheat-free oats can safely be included in a gluten-free diet ( GFD ) .
8030,BACKGROUND,"However , concerns have been raised with respect to the safety of oats in a subset of coeliacs ."
8031,OBJECTIVE,To describe faecal SCFA patterns in children with newly diagnosed CD treated for 1 year with a GFD with or without oats .
8032,METHODS,"This report is part of a randomised , double-blind study on the effect of a GFD containing oats ( GFD-oats ) vs. a standard GFD ( GFD-std ) ."
8033,METHODS,Faecal samples were received from 34 children in the GFD-oats group and 37 in the GFD-std group at initial diagnosis and/or after 1 year on a GFD .
8034,METHODS,Faecal SCFAs were analysed .
8035,RESULTS,The GFD-std group had a significantly lower total faecal SCFA concentration at 12 months compared with 0 months ( P < 0.05 ) .
8036,RESULTS,"In contrast , total SCFA in the GFD-oats group remained high after 1 year on the GFD ."
8037,RESULTS,"The children in the GFD-oats group had significantly higher acetic acid ( P < 0.05 ) , n-butyric acid ( P < 0.05 ) and total SCFA concentration ( P < 0.01 ) after 1-year diet treatment compared to the GFD-std group ."
8038,CONCLUSIONS,"Our results indicate that oats do affect the gut microflora function , and that some coeliac children receiving oats may develop gut mucosal inflammation , that may present a risk for future complications ."
8039,OBJECTIVE,"Prucalopride is a selective , high-affinity agonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine ( serotonin ) receptor 4 that enhances motility in the gastrointestinal tract ."
8040,OBJECTIVE,"We performed a multicenter , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prucalopride in children ( 6 months to 18 years old ) with functional constipation ."
8041,METHODS,"Children with functional constipation , based on the Rome III criteria , were given prucalopride ( children 50 kg were given a 0.04 mg/kg oral solution ; children > 50 kg were given a 2-mg tablet ) or placebo once daily for 8 weeks ."
8042,METHODS,"The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of children with toileting skills who had a mean of 3 spontaneous bowel movements/week and 1 episode of fecal incontinence/2 weeks , from study weeks 5-8 ( responders ) ."
8043,METHODS,"Adverse events , clinical laboratory values , and electrocardiograms were monitored ."
8044,RESULTS,"Efficacy and safety were assessed in 213 children ( 106 prucalopride , 107 placebo ) ."
8045,RESULTS,"Twenty-five percent were younger than 4 years old , 50 % were 4-11 years old , and 25 % were 12-18 years old ; 55.4 % were girls ."
8046,RESULTS,"At screening , 62.3 % of patients in the prucalopride group and 55.1 % in the placebo group had a history of fecal incontinence ; 60.4 % and 55.1 % in the prucalopride and placebo groups , respectively , had a mean of 1 spontaneous bowel movements/week ."
8047,RESULTS,"The proportion of responders was similar between groups ( prucalopride , 17.0 % and placebo , 17.8 % ) ."
8048,RESULTS,"There were no statistically significant differences in the primary efficacy end point when patients were stratified by sex , age group , or country ."
8049,RESULTS,The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar in the prucalopride ( 69.8 % ) and placebo ( 60.7 % ) groups .
8050,CONCLUSIONS,"Prucalopride , although generally well tolerated , was not more effective than placebo in children with functional constipation ."
8051,CONCLUSIONS,ClinicalTrials.gov Number : NCT01330381 .
8052,BACKGROUND,"Epidemiologic studies have reported inconsistent associations of vitamin D and prostate cancer risk ; however , few have adequately controlled for detection bias related to prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening , and the results of many studies may be affected by occult prostate cancers among controls ."
8053,METHODS,"Data for this nested case-control analysis ( n = 1,695 cases/1 ,682 controls ) are from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial ."
8054,METHODS,Baseline serum was analyzed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D ] .
8055,METHODS,The presence or absence of cancer was subsequently determined by prostate biopsy .
8056,METHODS,"Polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate associations of 25 ( OH ) D with risk of total , Gleason 2-6 , Gleason 7 , and Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer ."
8057,METHODS,Results are presented for placebo and finasteride arms separately and combined .
8058,RESULTS,There were no associations of serum 25 ( OH ) D with total prostate cancer risk .
8059,RESULTS,"For Gleason 2-6 cancers , results were inconsistent across treatment arms with a suggestion of increased risk in the placebo arm only ; however , there was no dose-response relationship ."
8060,RESULTS,"For Gleason 8-10 prostate cancers , 25 ( OH ) D concentrations were associated with a linear decrease in risk among combined treatment arms [ quartile 4 vs. 1 : OR , 0.55 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.32-0 .94 ; P ( trend ) = 0.04 ] ."
8061,RESULTS,"These findings were somewhat stronger among men 65 versus 55-64 years at baseline ( quartile 4 vs. 1 : OR , 0.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.18-0 .88 vs. OR , 0.73 ; 95 % CI , 0.35-1 .52 , respectively ; P ( interaction ) = 0.52 ) ."
8062,CONCLUSIONS,Higher serum 25 ( OH ) D may modestly increase risk of Gleason 2-6 disease and more substantially reduce risk of Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer .
8063,CONCLUSIONS,Vitamin D may have different effects for different stages of prostate cancers .
8064,OBJECTIVE,"Antidepressant response varies between patients , possibly due to differences in the rate cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolise antidepressants into inactive compounds ."
8065,OBJECTIVE,Drug metabolism rates are influenced by common variants in the genes encoding these enzymes .
8066,OBJECTIVE,"However , it remains unclear whether treatment outcomes can be predicted by either CYP450 genotype or antidepressant serum concentration ."
8067,METHODS,"In GENDEP ( a pharmacogenetic study of depressed individuals treated with either escitalopram or nortriptyline ) , serum concentrations of antidepressants and their primary metabolite were measured after eight weeks treatment and variants in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were genotyped ."
8068,RESULTS,"Amongst patients taking escitalopram ( n = 223 ) , the genotype CYP2C19 was significantly associated with escitalopram serum concentrations and desmethylescitalopram : escitalopram ratio ."
8069,RESULTS,"For those taking nortriptyline ( n = 161 ) , the CYP2D6 genotype was significantly associated with nortriptyline and 10-hydroxynortriptyline serum concentrations and 10-hydroxynortriptyline : nortrip-tyline ratio ."
8070,RESULTS,CYP450 genotypes conferring greater enzyme activity were linked to lower drug serum concentrations and higher metabolite : drug ratios .
8071,RESULTS,"Nonetheless , no significant association was found between either CYP450 genotype or antidepressant serum concentration and treatment response ."
8072,CONCLUSIONS,"While there is a significant relationship between the CYP450 genotype and serum concentrations of escitalopram and nortriptyline , the genotypes are not predictive of differences in treatment response for either drug ."
8073,CONCLUSIONS,"Furthermore , differences in antidepressant serum concentrations are not associated with variability in treatment response ."
8074,BACKGROUND,Atrial fibrillation is a leading preventable cause of recurrent stroke for which early detection and treatment are critical .
8075,BACKGROUND,"However , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic and likely to go undetected and untreated in the routine care of patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) ."
8076,METHODS,"We randomly assigned 572 patients 55 years of age or older , without known atrial fibrillation , who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months ( cause undetermined after standard tests , including 24-hour electrocardiography [ ECG ] ) , to undergo additional noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring with either a 30-day event-triggered recorder ( intervention group ) or a conventional 24-hour monitor ( control group ) ."
8077,METHODS,The primary outcome was newly detected atrial fibrillation lasting 30 seconds or longer within 90 days after randomization .
8078,METHODS,Secondary outcomes included episodes of atrial fibrillation lasting 2.5 minutes or longer and anticoagulation status at 90 days .
8079,RESULTS,"Atrial fibrillation lasting 30 seconds or longer was detected in 45 of 280 patients ( 16.1 % ) in the intervention group , as compared with 9 of 277 ( 3.2 % ) in the control group ( absolute difference , 12.9 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 8.0 to 17.6 ; P < 0.001 ; number needed to screen , 8 ) ."
8080,RESULTS,"Atrial fibrillation lasting 2.5 minutes or longer was present in 28 of 284 patients ( 9.9 % ) in the intervention group , as compared with 7 of 277 ( 2.5 % ) in the control group ( absolute difference , 7.4 percentage points ; 95 % CI , 3.4 to 11.3 ; P < 0.001 ) ."
8081,RESULTS,"By 90 days , oral anticoagulant therapy had been prescribed for more patients in the intervention group than in the control group ( 52 of 280 patients [ 18.6 % ] vs. 31 of 279 [ 11.1 % ] ; absolute difference , 7.5 percentage points ; 95 % CI , 1.6 to 13.3 ; P = 0.01 ) ."
8082,CONCLUSIONS,"Among patients with a recent cryptogenic stroke or TIA who were 55 years of age or older , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was common ."
8083,CONCLUSIONS,"Noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring for a target of 30 days significantly improved the detection of atrial fibrillation by a factor of more than five and nearly doubled the rate of anticoagulant treatment , as compared with the standard practice of short-duration ECG monitoring ."

8085,OBJECTIVE,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) is the most common pediatric cancer .
8086,OBJECTIVE,Monitoring minimal residual disease ( MRD ) by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RQ-PCR ) provides information for patient stratification and individual risk-directed treatment .
8087,OBJECTIVE,Cooperative studies have documented that measurement of blast clearance from the bone marrow during and after induction therapy identifies patient populations with different risk of relapse .
8088,OBJECTIVE,We explored the possible contribution of measurements of MRD during the course of treatment .
8089,METHODS,We used RQ-PCR to detect MRD in 110 unselected patients treated in Italy in the International Collaborative Treatment Protocol for Children and Adolescents With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 ) .
8090,METHODS,The trial took place in AIEOP centers during postinduction chemotherapy .
8091,METHODS,"Results were categorized as negative , low positive ( below the quantitative range [ < 5 10 ( -4 ) ] ) , or high positive ( 5 10 ( -4 ) ) ."
8092,METHODS,Patients with at least one low-positive or high-positive result were assigned to the corresponding subgroup .
8093,RESULTS,"Patients who tested high positive , low positive , or negative had significantly different cumulative incidences of leukemia relapse : 83.3 % , 34.8 % , and 8.6 % , respectively ( P < .001 ) ."
8094,RESULTS,"Two thirds of positive cases were identified within 4 months after induction-consolidation therapy , suggesting that this time frame may be most suitable for cost-effective MRD monitoring , particularly in patients who did not clear their disease at the end of consolidation ."
8095,CONCLUSIONS,These findings provide further insights into the dynamic of MRD and the ongoing effort to define molecular relapse in childhood ALL .
8096,BACKGROUND,Our objective was to assess therapeutic non-inferiority of dual treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir and lamivudine to triple treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir plus two nucleos ( t ) ides for maintenance of HIV-1 viral suppression .
8097,METHODS,"In this randomised , open-label , non-inferiority trial , we recruited patients from 32 HIV units in hospitals in Spain and France ."
8098,METHODS,"Eligible patients were HIV-infected adults ( aged 18 years ) with HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL , for at least 6 months on triple treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir ( twice daily ) plus lamivudine or emtricitabine and a second nucleos ( t ) ide , with no resistance or virological failure to these drugs , and no positive hepatitis B serum surface antigen ."
8099,METHODS,Investigators at each centre randomly assigned patients ( 1:1 ; block size of four ; stratified by time to suppression [ < 1 year or > 1 year ] and nadir CD4 cell count [ < 100 cells per L or > 100 cells per L ] ; computer-generated random sequence ) to continue triple treatment or switch to dual treatment ( oral lopinavir 400 mg and oral ritonavir 100 mg twice daily plus oral lamivudine 300 mg once daily ) .
8100,METHODS,The primary endpoint was response to treatment in the intention-to-treat population ( all randomised patients ) at 48 weeks .
8101,METHODS,The non-inferiority margin was 12 % .
8102,METHODS,"This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01471821 ."
8103,RESULTS,"Between Oct 1 , 2011 , and April 1 , 2013 , we randomly assigned 250 participants to continue triple treatment ( 127 [ 51 % ] patients ) or switch to dual treatment ( 123 [ 49 % ] patients ) ."
8104,RESULTS,"In the intention-to-treat population , 110 ( 866 % ) of 127 patients in the triple-treatment group responded to treatment versus 108 ( 878 % ) of 123 in the dual-treatment group ( difference -12 % [ 95 % CI -96 to 73 ] ; p = 092 ) , meeting the criteria for non-inferiority ."
8105,RESULTS,"Serious adverse events occurred in eight ( 7 % ) patients in the triple-treatment group and five ( 4 % ) in the dual-treatment group ( p = 0515 ) , and study drug discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in four ( 3 % ) in the triple-treatment group and one ( 1 % ) in the dual-treatment group ( p = 0223 ) ."
8106,CONCLUSIONS,Dual treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir plus lamivudine has non-inferior therapeutic efficacy and is similarly tolerated to triple treatment .

8108,BACKGROUND,Factors and outcomes associated with end-of-life decision-making among patients during clinical trials in the intensive care unit are unclear .
8109,OBJECTIVE,We sought to determine patterns and outcomes of Do Not Resuscitate ( DNR ) decisions among critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) enrolled in a clinical trial .
8110,METHODS,"We performed a secondary analysis of data from the ARDS Network Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial ( FACTT ) , collected between 2000 and 2005 ."
8111,METHODS,"We calculated mortality outcomes stratified by code status , and compared baseline characteristics of patients who became DNR during the trial with participants who remained full code ."
8112,RESULTS,"Among 809 FACTT participants with a code status recorded , 232 ( 28.7 % ) elected DNR status ."
8113,RESULTS,"Specifically , 37 ( 15.9 % ) chose to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation alone , 44 ( 19.0 % ) elected to withhold some life support measures in addition to cardiopulmonary resuscitation , and 151 ( 65.1 % ) had life support withdrawn ."
8114,RESULTS,"Admission severity of illness as measured by APACHE III score was strongly associated with election of DNR status ( odds ratio , 2.2 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.85-2 .62 ; P < 0.0001 ) ."
8115,RESULTS,"Almost all ( 97.0 % ; 225 of 232 ) patients who selected DNR status died , and 79 % ( 225 of 284 ) of patients who died during the trial were DNR ."
8116,RESULTS,"Among patients who chose DNR status but did not elect withdrawal of life support , 91 % ( 74 of 81 ) died ."
8117,CONCLUSIONS,The vast majority of deaths among clinical trial patients with ARDS were preceded by a DNR order .
8118,CONCLUSIONS,"Unlike other studies of end-of-life decision-making in the intensive care unit , nearly all patients who became DNR died ."
8119,CONCLUSIONS,The impact of variation of practice in end-of-life decision-making during clinical trials warrants further study .
8120,BACKGROUND,Etravirine ( ETR ) was approved for patients with virological failure and antiretroviral resistance mutations .
8121,BACKGROUND,It has also shown antiviral efficacy in antiretroviral-nave patients .
8122,BACKGROUND,"However , data on the switching from protease inhibitors ( PI ) to ETR are lacking ."
8123,METHODS,"HIV-1-infected patients with suppressed viral load ( VL ) during a PI-containing regimen ( > 12 months ) and no previous virological failure were randomized to switch from the PI to ETR ( 400 mg/day , dissolved in water ) ( ETR group , n = 22 ) or to continue with the same regimen ( control group , n = 21 ) ."
8124,METHODS,"Percentage of patients with VL 50 copies/mL were assessed at week 48 , as well as changes in CD4 T-cell counts and metabolic profile ."

8126,RESULTS,Two patients receiving ETR ( grade-1 diarrhea and voluntary discontinuation ) and another in the control group ( simplification ) discontinued therapy early .
8127,RESULTS,"No patients presented virological failure ( two consecutive VL > 50 copies/mL ) ; treatment was successful in 95.2 % of the control group and 90.9 % of the ETR group ( intention-to-treat analysis , missing = failure ) ( p = 0.58 ) ."
8128,RESULTS,CD4 + T-cell counts did not significantly vary [ +49 cells/L in the ETR group ( p = 0.25 ) and -4 cells/L in the control group ( p = 0.71 ) ] .
8129,RESULTS,"The ETR group showed significant reductions in cholesterol ( p < 0.001 ) , triglycerides ( p = < 0.001 ) , and glycemia ( p = 0.03 ) and higher satisfaction ( 0-10 scale ) ( p = 0.04 ) ."
8130,RESULTS,Trough plasma concentrations of ETR were similar to observed in studies using ETR twice daily .
8131,CONCLUSIONS,Switch from a PI-based regimen to a once-daily combination based on ETR maintained undetectable VL during 48 weeks in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients while lipid profile and patient satisfaction improved significantly .

8133,OBJECTIVE,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of deep dry needling ( DDN ) on spasticity , pressure sensitivity , and plantar pressure in patients who have had stroke ."
8134,METHODS,A randomized controlled trial was conducted .
8135,METHODS,Thirty-four patients who previously had a stroke were randomly assigned either an experimental group that received a single session of DDN over the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles on the spastic leg or a control group that received no intervention .
8136,METHODS,"Spasticity ( evaluated with the Ashworth Scale ) ; pressure pain thresholds over the deltoid muscle , second metacarpal , and tibialis anterior muscle ; and plantar pressure ( baropodometry ) were collected by a blinded assessor before and 10 minutes after intervention ."
8137,RESULTS,A greater number of individuals receiving DDN exhibited decreased spasticity after the intervention ( P < .001 ) .
8138,RESULTS,The analysis of covariance showed that pressure pain thresholds increased bilaterally in patients receiving DDN compared with those who did not receive the intervention ( P < .001 ) .
8139,RESULTS,"The analysis of covariance also found that patients receiving DDN experienced bilateral increases of support surface in the forefoot , unilateral increase of the support surface in the rear foot of the treated ( affected ) side , and bilateral decreases in mean pressure ( all , P < .02 ) as compared with those who did not receive DDN ."
8140,CONCLUSIONS,Our results suggest that a single session of DDN decreases spasticity and widespread pressure sensitivity in individuals with poststroke spasticity .
8141,CONCLUSIONS,Deep dry needling also induced changes in plantar pressure by increasing the support surface and decreasing the mean pressure .
8142,OBJECTIVE,To compare patient preference for either sharp incision with scissors or blunt manual cleavage of the fascia at cesarean delivery in a randomized controlled trial in which each woman was her own control .
8143,METHODS,Women undergoing primary cesarean delivery ( n = 34 ) were randomized to side distribution of sharp or blunt incision of the fascia ( sharp right and blunt left or blunt right and sharp left ) and followed three months postoperatively .
8144,METHODS,The primary outcome was patient preference for the right or left side of the scar 3 months postoperatively and modeled by polytomous logistic regression .
8145,METHODS,"The secondary outcome was difference in pain between the two sides measured on a 0.0-10 .0 numerical rating scale at 1 , 3 , and 7 days and 1 and 3 months postoperatively ."
8146,METHODS,Pain scores were analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test .
8147,RESULTS,28 cases were analyzed and no significant difference was found in preference after three months .

8160,METHODS,Life satisfaction and general well-being 3 months after childbirth ( by a Satisfaction with Life Scale and Well-being Visual Analogue Scale ) .
8161,RESULTS,"The groups did not differ in total direct costs ( 3786/woman in psychoeducative group and 3830/woman in control group ) , nor in life satisfaction or general well-being ."
8162,RESULTS,"Although only 76 ( 30 % ) of the women assigned to the surveillance were referred to special maternity care and 36 ( 15 % ) attended advanced prenatal classes , costs in the psychoeducation group did not exceed the costs of the controls , mostly because of the greater number of uncomplicated vaginal deliveries ( 63 % vs. 47 % , p = 0.005 ) ."

8177,OBJECTIVE,The goal of the study was to examine if intake of Lactobacillus plantarum can accelerate clearance of nontyphoid Salmonella and reduce infection-related symptoms .
8178,BACKGROUND,Nontyphoid Salmonella is a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide .
8179,BACKGROUND,Few studies have explored the effect of probiotics in these infections .
8180,METHODS,Patients with Salmonella infection were randomized to daily intake of 5 10 colony forming units of freeze-dried Lactobacillus plantarum 299 v or placebo .
8181,METHODS,Symptoms were recorded daily .
8182,METHODS,Feces were cultured weekly .
8183,METHODS,Treatment continued until 4 consecutive stool cultures negative for Salmonella had been obtained .
8184,RESULTS,"The treatment and placebo groups did not differ significantly with regard to time to clearance of Salmonella , or time to resolution of symptoms ."
8185,RESULTS,"Irrespective of treatment , women tended to clear Salmonella more rapidly than men ( 19 vs. 28 d , P = 0.18 ) , despite a longer diarrheal phase ( 5 vs. 3 days after inclusion , P = 0.001 ) ."
8186,RESULTS,"After Salmonella clearance ( postinfectious phase ) , women experienced loose stools , nausea , and flatulence more frequently than men ."
8187,RESULTS,"In women , L. plantarum treatment was associated with more abdominal pain , whereas in men L. plantarum treatment reduced the prevalence of hard stools , and increased the presence of diarrheal symptoms in the postinfectious phase ."
8188,CONCLUSIONS,"Gender , but not administration of the probiotic strain L. plantarum 299 v , may influence acute symptoms during Salmonella infection and possibly clearance of Salmonella ."
8189,CONCLUSIONS,"Symptoms in the postinfectious phase were modified by the probiotics in a gender-specific way , but our results give little support for positive effects of L. plantarum 299 v treatment in nontyphoid salmonellosis ."
8190,BACKGROUND,"Swallowing problems following stroke may result in increased risk of aspiration pneumonia , malnutrition , and dehydration ."
8191,OBJECTIVE,Our hypothesis was that three neurostimulation techniques would produce beneficial effects on chronic dysphagia following stroke through a common brain mechanism that would predict behavioral response .
8192,METHODS,"In 18 dysphagic stroke patients ( mean age : 66 3 years , 3 female , time-post-stroke : 63 15 weeks [ SD ] ) , pharyngeal electromyographic responses were recorded after single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) over the pharyngeal motor cortex , to measure corticobulbar excitability before , immediately , and 30 min , after real and sham applications of neurostimulation ."
8193,METHODS,"Patients were randomized to a single session of either : pharyngeal electrical stimulation ( PES ) , paired associative stimulation ( PAS ) or repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) ."
8194,METHODS,Penetration-aspiration scores and bolus transfer timings were assessed before and after both real and sham interventions using videofluoroscopy .
8195,RESULTS,"Corticobulbar excitability of pharyngeal motor cortex was beneficially modulated by PES , PAS and to a lesser extent by rTMS , with functionally relevant changes in the unaffected hemisphere ."
8196,RESULTS,"Following combining the results of real neurostimulation , an overall increase in corticobulbar excitability in the unaffected hemisphere ( P = .005 , F1 ,17 = 10.6 , ANOVA ) with an associated 15 % reduction in aspiration ( P = .005 , z = -2.79 ) was observed compared to sham ."
8197,CONCLUSIONS,"In this mechanistic study , an increase in corticobulbar excitability the unaffected projection was correlated with the improvement in swallowing safety ( P = .001 , rho = -.732 ) , but modality-specific differences were observed ."
8198,CONCLUSIONS,Paradigms providing peripheral input favored change in neurophysiological and behavioral outcome measures in chronic dysphagia patients .
8199,CONCLUSIONS,Further larger cohort studies of neurostimulation in chronic dysphagic stroke are imperative .
8200,OBJECTIVE,"Active immunization , or vaccination , with tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - Kinoid ( TNF-K ) is a novel approach to induce polyclonal anti-TNF antibodies in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases ."
8201,OBJECTIVE,This study was performed to transfer the proof of concept obtained in mice model of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) into human .
8202,OBJECTIVE,We designed a pilot study to demonstrate the feasibility of therapeutic vaccination in RA .
8203,METHODS,"This was a phase IIa , placebo-controlled , multicenter study in adults with RA who previously experienced secondary failure of TNF antagonists ."
8204,METHODS,"Patients were immunized intramuscularly with 2 or 3 doses of placebo ( n = 10 ) or 90 ( n = 6 ) , 180 ( n = 12 ) , or 360 g TNF-K ( n = 12 ) ."
8205,METHODS,The primary objective was to identify the best dose and schedule based on anti-TNF antibody titers .
8206,METHODS,Clinical symptoms and safety were assessed during 12 months and solicited reactions for 7 days after each injection .
8207,RESULTS,"The highest anti-TNF antibody response was detected in patients immunized with 360 g TNF-K and with 3 injections , although this difference was not significant with all other groups ."
8208,RESULTS,Similar proportions of patients receiving TNF-K and placebo reported adverse events up to month 12 .
8209,RESULTS,"Serious adverse events were reported by 4 patients treated with TNF-K ( 13.3 % ) and 3 treated with placebo ( 30.0 % ) , all unrelated to treatment ."
8210,RESULTS,"At month 12 , DAS28-CRP , tender and swollen joint counts , and HAQ scores decreased significantly more in patients who exhibited anti-TNF antibody response than in patients who did not ."
8211,CONCLUSIONS,TNF-K therapeutic vaccination induced dose - and schedule-dependent anti-TNF antibodies in RA patients and was well tolerated .
8212,CONCLUSIONS,Patients who developed anti-TNF antibodies showed a trend toward clinical improvement .
8213,CONCLUSIONS,"Although the most aggressive dose and schedule , i.e. 360 mg dose administered 3 times , did show a strong trend of higher antibody response , further studies are warranted to examine even higher and more frequent doses in order to establish the best conditions for clinical improvement ."

8215,OBJECTIVE,We evaluated the population pharmacokinetics ( PPK ) and exposure-response relationship of imatinib mesylate in Iranian patients with chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) .
8216,OBJECTIVE,This study was designed to assess steady state ( SS ) imatinib trough concentrations ( Cmin ) and pharmacokinetics parameters of imatinib in patients with CML in chronic phase after at least 12-month treatment .
8217,METHODS,"Plasma concentrations from a randomized controlled trial consist of 61 patients who received oral imatinib at doses ranged between 300 and 800 mg in various dosing interval , which were quantified using a validated reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method with UV detection method on different occasions at SS and evaluated using PPK model ."
8218,RESULTS,A one-compartment model with zero-order absorption and a lag time was sufficient in describing the concentration-time profile .
8219,RESULTS,Inter-individual variability ( IIV ) was modeled for all parameters .
8220,RESULTS,"Oral clearance ( CL/F ) and the volume of distribution ( V/F ) were estimated to 10.8 L/h with 30 % IIV and 265 L with 53 % IIV , respectively ."
8221,RESULTS,Inter-occasion variability ( IOV ) was included in CL/F ( 17 % ) and V/F ( 22 % ) .
8222,RESULTS,The proportional residual error of the model was 8 % .
8223,CONCLUSIONS,Simulation analysis from individual parameters shows exposure to imatinib is highly variable among patients .
8224,CONCLUSIONS,"Imatinib trough plasma levels < 1,257 ng/mL were associated with lower rates of major molecular response ."
8225,CONCLUSIONS,"Because of the wide IIV compared with IOV with imatinib in our study , trough levels may play a role in investigating instances of suboptimal response ."
8226,BACKGROUND,"Diabetes prevention is a public health priority that is dependent upon the reach , effectiveness , and cost of intervention strategies ."
8227,BACKGROUND,"However , understanding each of these outcomes within the context of randomized controlled trials is problematic ."
8228,OBJECTIVE,To describe the methods and design of a hybrid preference/randomized control trial using the RE-AIM framework .
8229,METHODS,"The trial , which was developed using the RE-AIM framework , will contrast the effects of 3 interventions : ( 1 ) a standard care , small group , diabetes prevention education class ( SG ) , ( 2 ) the small group intervention plus 12 months of interactive voice response telephone follow-up ( SG-IVR ) , and ( 3 ) a DVD version of the small group intervention with the same IVR follow-up ( DVD-IVR ) ."
8230,METHODS,Each intervention includes personal action planning with a focus on key elements of the lifestyle intervention from the Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) .
8231,METHODS,Adult patients at risk for diabetes will be randomly assigned to either choice or RCT .
8232,METHODS,Those assigned to choice ( n = 240 ) will have the opportunity to choose between SG-IVR and DVD-IVR .
8233,METHODS,"Those assigned to RCT group ( n = 360 ) will be randomly assigned to SG , SG-IVR , or DVD-IRV ."
8234,METHODS,"Assessment of primary ( weight loss , reach , & cost ) and secondary ( physical activity , & dietary intake ) outcomes will occur at baseline , 6 , 12 , and 18 months ."
8235,CONCLUSIONS,"This will be the first diabetes prevention trial that will allow the research team to determine the relationships between reach , effectiveness , and cost of different interventions ."
8236,BACKGROUND,Agomelatine was efficacious in reducing symptoms in a short-term placebo-controlled trial in generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) and in preventing relapse in a longer term placebo-controlled study .
8237,BACKGROUND,An additional short-term placebo-controlled study is required by regulatory agencies to confirm the efficacy of agomelatine in GAD .
8238,METHODS,"This 12-week , placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomized , parallel group , international , multicenter study was designed to confirm the efficacy of agomelatine 25-50 mg/d in the treatment of patients with a primary DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of GAD ."
8239,METHODS,The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HARS ) total score .
8240,METHODS,Assay sensitivity was evaluated by including an escitalopram ( 10-20 mg/d ) group .
8241,METHODS,"The study was undertaken in 45 clinical centers in Argentina , Czech Republic , Finland , South Korea , Poland , Russia , and Slovakia from April 2010 to July 2011 ."
8242,RESULTS,"One hundred thirty-nine outpatients were included in the agomelatine group , 131 in the placebo group , and 142 in the escitalopram group ."
8243,RESULTS,"Agomelatine significantly reduced mean ( SD ) HARS total score ( agomelatine-placebo difference : 4.71 [ 1.03 ] , P < .0001 ) and had significant effects on secondary outcome measures , including psychic and somatic HARS subscales , response rate ( estimate [ standard error ] ) ( agomelatine-placebo difference : 27.4 % [ 5.9 % ] , P < .0001 ) , remission on the HARS ( agomelatine-placebo difference : 16.8 % [ 5.4 % ] , P = .002 ) , Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale ( CGI-S ) ( P < .001 ) , functional impairment ( P < .0001 ) , and sleep quality ( P < .001 ) ."
8244,RESULTS,Findings were confirmed in the subset of more severely ill patients ( HARS total score 25 with or without CGI-S 5 at baseline ) .
8245,RESULTS,"Agomelatine was well tolerated by patients , with no more adverse events than placebo ."
8246,RESULTS,Escitalopram was similarly efficacious but was accompanied by a higher incidence of adverse events compared to placebo .
8247,CONCLUSIONS,"In clinical practice , agomelatine has at least similar efficacy to that of escitalopram for the short-term treatment of GAD and is well tolerated ."

8250,BACKGROUND,Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) is followed by significant inflammation .
8251,BACKGROUND,Protoporphyrin ( Pp ) IX is still formed in the skin after PDT and patients are sensitive to daylight 24-48 h after treatment .
8252,BACKGROUND,Exposure to daylight after PDT may therefore increase inflammation .
8253,OBJECTIVE,"To investigate whether protection with inorganic sunscreen , foundation or light-blocking plaster after PDT can reduce inflammation caused by daylight-activated PpIX ."
8254,METHODS,"On the right arm of 15 subjects with sun-damaged skin , four identical squares ( 3 3 cm ) were given conventional PDT treatment ."
8255,METHODS,"Immediately after red-light illumination the squares were either left unprotected or protected by inorganic sunscreen [ sun protection factor ( SPF ) 50 ] , foundation ( SPF50 ) or light-blocking plaster ."
8256,METHODS,The skin was then illuminated with artificial daylight for 2 h and afterwards covered for 24 h. Fluorescence and erythema ( inflammation ) were measured with a fluorescence camera and a reflectance meter .
8257,RESULTS,"PpIX was significantly reduced after artificial daylight illumination ( P < 00004 ) , except on the square protected with light-blocking silver plaster , where it had increased ( P = 009 ) ."
8258,RESULTS,"The increased erythema 24 h after treatment was reduced by 19 % with the sunscreen ( P = 029 ) , by 27 % with the foundation ( P = 010 ) and by 44 % with the silver plaster ( P = 0002 ) ."
8259,CONCLUSIONS,Artificial daylight exposure after conventional PDT increases skin erythema .
8260,CONCLUSIONS,Light-blocking plaster gives more effective protection against post-PDT daylight exposure than inorganic sunscreen and foundation .
8261,CONCLUSIONS,In practice such full protection can be achieved by use of sun-blocking clothes or daylight avoidance for 24 h.
8262,BACKGROUND,Less than half of breast cancer survivors with lymphedema perform self-care as directed .
8263,BACKGROUND,Effective lymphedema self-care is required to obtain acceptable health outcomes .
8264,BACKGROUND,Self-Regulation Theory suggests that objective self-measurement of physiological conditions is necessary to promote self-regulation/self-care .
8265,BACKGROUND,Bioelectric Impedance Spectroscopy ( BIS ) represents a potential self-measurement method for arm lymphedema .
8266,BACKGROUND,The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the impact of arm self-measurement on daily self-care activities and health outcomes in breast cancer survivors with lymphedema .
8267,RESULTS,A pilot randomized clinical trial compared outcomes between breast cancer survivors with lymphedema who self-monitored for 3 months and breast cancer survivors with lymphedema who did not self-monitor .
8268,RESULTS,"Data were collected at baseline , months 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ."
8269,RESULTS,"Eighty-six women with lymphedema were screened : 62 were eligible , 50 were enrolled , 10 withdrew , and 1 had incomplete data , thus N = 39 ."
8270,RESULTS,No between group differences were noted in participant characteristics .
8271,RESULTS,The self-monitored group had higher days of garment use ( p = 0.005 ) that remained stable after self-monitoring stopped .
8272,RESULTS,The median number of days of simple manual lymphatic drainage increased in the intervention group ( p = 0.004 ) with a downward trend after self-monitoring ceased .
8273,CONCLUSIONS,Objective self-monitoring of arms using BIS is possible .
8274,CONCLUSIONS,Self-monitoring may positively impact self-care behaviors .
8275,CONCLUSIONS,Highly symptomatic patients may require coaching or other psychological support to improve their self-care .
8276,CONCLUSIONS,Studies that combine a cognitive behavioral therapy component along with self-measurement should be considered as potential interventions to impact lymphedema self-care .
8277,CONCLUSIONS,Other applications of self-monitoring warrant investigation .
8278,OBJECTIVE,To determine whether the application of occlusive wrap applied immediately after birth will reduce mortality in very preterm infants .
8279,METHODS,This was a prospective randomized controlled trial of infants born 24 0/7 to 27 6/7 weeks ' gestation who were assigned randomly to occlusive wrap or no wrap .
8280,METHODS,The primary outcome was all cause mortality at discharge or 6 months ' corrected age .
8281,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes included temperature , Apgar scores , pH , base deficit , blood pressure and glucose , respiratory distress syndrome , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , seizures , patent ductus arteriosus , necrotizing enterocolitis , gastrointestinal perforation , intraventricular hemorrhage , cystic periventricular leukomalacia , pulmonary hemorrhage , retinopathy of prematurity , sepsis , hearing screen , and pneumothorax ."
8282,RESULTS,Eight hundred one infants were enrolled .
8283,RESULTS,There was no difference in baseline population characteristics .
8284,RESULTS,"There were no significant differences in mortality ( OR 1.0 , 95 % CI 0.7-1 .5 ) ."
8285,RESULTS,"Wrap infants had statistically significant greater baseline temperatures ( 36.3 C wrap vs 35.7 C no wrap , P < .0001 ) and poststabilization temperatures ( 36.6 C vs 36.2 C , P < .001 ) than nonwrap infants ."
8286,RESULTS,"For the secondary outcomes , there was a significant decrease in pulmonary hemorrhage ( OR 0.6 , 95 % CI 0.3-0 .9 ) in the wrap group and a significant lower mean one minute Apgar score ( P = .007 ) in the wrap group ."
8287,RESULTS,The study was stopped early because continued enrollment would not result in the attainment of a significant difference in the primary outcome .
8288,CONCLUSIONS,Application of occlusive wrap to very preterm infants immediately after birth results in greater mean body temperature but does not reduce mortality .
8289,BACKGROUND,Nondisabling cerebrovascular events represent the largest group of cerebrovascular disease with a high risk of recurrent stroke .
8290,BACKGROUND,"A recent trial demonstrated that dual-antiplatelet therapy ( clopidogrel and aspirin ) , compared with aspirin monotherapy , reduced the risk of recurrent stroke and was not associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic events ."
8291,BACKGROUND,"Apixaban , a new oral anticoagulant , has been proven to be as safe and effective as traditional anticoagulants while carrying significantly less risk of intracranial hemorrhage ."
8292,BACKGROUND,"Patients with transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) / minor stroke might benefit from apixaban treatment ; therefore , an adequately powered randomized study is needed ."
8293,RESULTS,"The ADANCE [ Apixaban Versus Dual-antiplatelet Therapy ( Clopidogrel and Aspirin ) in Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events ] study is a randomized , double-blind clinical trial with a target enrollment of 5,500 patients ."
8294,RESULTS,A 21-day regimen of apixaban or of clopidogrel with aspirin followed by clopidogrel on days 22 through 90 will be administered to randomized participants with acute TIA or minor ischemic stroke .
8295,RESULTS,"The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of patients with any new stroke ( ischemic or hemorrhage ) , including fatal stroke , at day 21 ."
8296,RESULTS,"Study visits will be performed on the day of randomization , and at days 7 , 22 , and 90 ."
8297,CONCLUSIONS,The novel oral anticoagulant apixaban has been widely used with fewer adverse effects than traditional anticoagulants .
8298,CONCLUSIONS,We designed the ADANCE trial to observe the effects of apixaban on recurrent stroke after TIA or minor stroke .
8299,CONCLUSIONS,The results should better guide the selection of anticoagulant or dual-antiplatelet therapy for patients with acute TIA or minor ischemic stroke .

8312,BACKGROUND,Glucose measurement in intensive care medicine is performed intermittently with the risk of undetected hypoglycemia .
8313,BACKGROUND,The workload for the ICU nursing staff is substantial .
8314,BACKGROUND,Subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) systems are available and may be able to solve some of these issues in critically ill patients .
8315,METHODS,In a randomized controlled design in a mixed ICU in a teaching hospital we compared the use of subcutaneous CGM with frequent point of care ( POC ) to guide insulin treatment .
8316,METHODS,Adult critically ill patients with an expected stay of more than 24 hours and in need of insulin therapy were included .
8317,METHODS,All patients received subcutaneous CGM .
8318,METHODS,"CGM data were blinded in the control group , whereas in the intervention group these data were used to feed a computerized glucose regulation algorithm ."
8319,METHODS,The same algorithm was used in the control group fed by intermittent POC glucose measurements .
8320,METHODS,"Safety was assessed with the incidence of severe hypoglycemia ( < 2.2 mmol/L ) , efficacy with the percentage time in target range ( 5.0 to 9.0 mmol/L ) ."
8321,METHODS,"In addition , we assessed nursing workload and costs ."
8322,RESULTS,"In this study , 87 patients were randomized to the intervention and 90 to the control group ."
8323,RESULTS,CGM device failure resulted in 78 and 78 patients for analysis .
8324,RESULTS,The incidence of severe glycemia and percentage of time within target range was similar in both groups .
8325,RESULTS,A significant reduction in daily nursing workload for glucose control was found in the intervention group ( 17 versus 36 minutes ; P < 0.001 ) .
8326,RESULTS,"Mean daily costs per patient were significantly reduced with EUR 12 ( 95 % CI -32 to -18 , P = 0.02 ) in the intervention group ."
8327,CONCLUSIONS,Subcutaneous CGM to guide insulin treatment in critically ill patients is as safe and effective as intermittent point-of-care measurements and reduces nursing workload and daily costs .
8328,CONCLUSIONS,A new algorithm designed for frequent measurements may lead to improved performance and should precede clinical implementation .

8331,BACKGROUND,Regular exercise and dietary practices have been shown to affect the health-related quality of life ( HRQOL ) and survival of breast cancer patients .
8332,OBJECTIVE,The current study aimed to investigate whether the WSEDI was a feasible and primarily effective method for promoting exercise and dietary behaviours for breast cancer patients .
8333,METHODS,"A 12-week randomized , controlled trial ."
8334,METHODS,Oncology outpatient treatment clinics at 3 university hospitals and 1 National Cancer Center in South Korea .
8335,METHODS,Fifty-nine breast cancer patients who had received curative surgery and completed primary cancer treatment within 12 months prior to the study and who had been diagnosed with stage 0-III cancers within 2 years prior to the study were recruited .
8336,METHODS,"Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group , which used a Web-based self-management exercise and diet intervention program incorporating transtheoretical model ( TTM ) - based strategies ( n = 29 ) , or to the control group , which used a 50-page educational booklet on exercise and diet ( n = 28 ) ."
8337,METHODS,"The intervention efficacy was measured at the baseline and 12 weeks via a Web-based survey that addressed the promotion of exercise and consumption of 5 servings of fruits and vegetables ( F&V ) per day , dietary quality , HRQOL , anxiety , depression , fatigue , motivational readiness , and self-efficacy ."
8338,RESULTS,"The proportion of subjects who performed at least moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for at least 150 min per week ; ate 5 servings of F&V per day ; and had overall improvements in dietary quality , physical functioning and appetite loss ( HRQOL ) , fatigue , and motivational readiness was greater in the intervention group than in the control group ."
8339,RESULTS,The self-efficacy with respect to exercise and F&V consumption was greater in the intervention group than in the control group .
8340,RESULTS,"A Web-based program that targets changes in exercise and dietary behaviours might be effective for breast cancer survivors if the TTM theory has been used to inform the program strategy , although further research with a larger sample size is required to enable definitive conclusions ."
8341,BACKGROUND,Fidelity assessments are integral to intervention research but few published trials report these processes in detail .
8342,BACKGROUND,We included plans for fidelity monitoring in the design of a community-based intervention trial .
8343,METHODS,The study design was a randomized clinical trial of an intervention provided to low-income women to increase utilization of dental care during pregnancy ( mother ) or the postpartum ( child ) period .
8344,METHODS,Group assignment followed a 2 2 factorial design in which participants were randomly assigned to receive either brief Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) or Health Education ( HE ) during pregnancy ( prenatal ) and then randomly reassigned to one of these groups for the postpartum intervention .
8345,METHODS,"The study setting was four county health departments in rural Oregon State , USA ."
8346,METHODS,Counseling was standardized using a step-by-step manual .
8347,METHODS,Counselors were trained to criteria prior to delivering the intervention and fidelity monitoring continued throughout the implementation period based on audio recordings of counselor-participant sessions .
8348,METHODS,"The Yale Adherence and Competence Scale ( YACS ) , modified for this study , was used to code the audio recordings of the counselors ' delivery of both the MI and HE interventions ."

8350,METHODS,Participants provided a second source of fidelity data .
8351,METHODS,"As a second source of fidelity data , the participants completed the Feedback Questionnaire that included ratings of their satisfaction with the counselors at the completion of the prenatal and post-partum interventions ."
8352,RESULTS,Coding indicated counselor adherence to MI protocol and variation among counselors in the use of MI skills in the MI condition .
8353,RESULTS,Almost no MI behaviors were found in the HE condition .
8354,RESULTS,"Differences in the length of time to deliver intervention were found ; as expected , the HE intervention took less time ."
8355,RESULTS,There were no differences between the overall participants ' satisfaction ratings of the HE and MI sessions by individual counselor or overall ( p > .05 ) .
8356,CONCLUSIONS,"Trial design , protocol specification , training , and continuous supervision led to a high degree of treatment fidelity for the counseling interventions in this randomized clinical trial and will increase confidence in the interpretation of the trial findings ."

8368,BACKGROUND,"Burnout syndrome is an important health problem that affects many professionals and must be addressed globally , with both organizational measures and personal interventions ."
8369,BACKGROUND,"Burnout of health professionals can be prevented in order to avoid personal , familial , and social consequences , as well as repercussions for patients ."
8370,METHODS,"This work describes a protocol for a controlled , pragmatic , randomized clinical trial in 2 parallel groups : intervention and control ."
8371,METHODS,"All health professionals from 7 health care centers will form the intervention group , and all health professionals from 7 different health care centers will form the control group ."
8372,METHODS,The intervention group will receive 16 hours of training at their work place .
8373,METHODS,"The Maslach 's burnout inventory , the Cuestionario de Desgaste Profesional Mdico or the Cuestionario de Desgaste Profesional de Enfermera , and the 28-item Goldberg 's General Health Questionnaire , validated for our setting , will be used as measurement tools ."
8374,METHODS,"Change in the average scores from the Maslach 's burnout inventory emotional exhaustion scale will be compared between the intervention and control groups , measured as intention-to-treat , and the intervention will be considered effective if a minimum decrease of 20 % is achieved ."
8375,CONCLUSIONS,"Due to the deleterious consequences of burnout syndrome for people suffering from it and for the organization where they work , it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of certain interventions for its prevention ."
8376,CONCLUSIONS,"Organizational measures are important for preventing burnout syndrome , but so is providing professionals with coping strategies , as this group intervention intends to do ."

8379,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate whether administration of analgesic medication one hour before undergoing office hysteroscopy decreased pain and other side effects .
8380,METHODS,A prospective randomized study was carried out in 200 patients who underwent office hysteroscopy from November 2011 until May 2012.100 patients received 1000mg paracetamol and 600mg ibuprofen one hour before the procedure and 100 did not receive any medication .
8381,RESULTS,"We observed significant differences ( p = 0.013 ) regarding the occurrence of non-pain side effects , 6 % in the non-medicated group and none of the patients in the medicated group ."
8382,RESULTS,"The main pain score was always slightly higher in the group receiving no medication , though there was no statistically significant difference when compared to the medicated group ."
8383,CONCLUSIONS,"Administration of 1g paracetamol and 600mg ibuprofen one hour prior to office hysteroscopy decreased statistically the occurrence of non-pain side effects such as nausea , emesis , and hypotension ."
8384,CONCLUSIONS,No differences in pain scores were observed .
8385,BACKGROUND,"Vitamin D promotes bone health and regulates the immune system , both important actions for pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) ."
8386,BACKGROUND,The supplementation dose that would maintain optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration ( 25OHD 32 ng/mL ) is unknown .
8387,OBJECTIVE,The objective of the study was to compare two supplementation regimens ' efficacy and safety in maintaining optimal 25OHD in children with IBD .
8388,METHODS,"This was a randomized , not blinded , controlled trial ."
8389,METHODS,The trial was conducted in the Boston Children 's Hospital Clinical and Translational Study Unit .
8390,METHODS,"Sixty-three patients , aged 8-18 years with IBD and baseline 25OHD greater than 20 ng/mL were enrolled ; 48 completed the study , and one withdrew for adverse events ."
8391,METHODS,Arm A received 400 IU of oral vitamin D2 daily ( n = 32 ) .
8392,METHODS,Arm B received 1000 IU daily in the summer/fall and 2000 IU in the winter/spring ( n = 31 ) .
8393,RESULTS,The main outcome was the probability of maintaining 25OHD of 32 ng/mL or greater in all trimonthly visits for 12 months .
8394,RESULTS,Three participants in arm A ( 9.4 % ) and three in arm B ( 9.7 % ) achieved the primary outcome ( P = .97 ) .
8395,RESULTS,"The incidence of adverse events , all minor , did not differ ."
8396,RESULTS,"More participants in arm A developed C-reactive protein level of 1 mg/dL or greater ( 31 % vs 10 % , P = .04 ) and IL-6 greater than 3 pg/mL ( 54 % vs 27 % , P = .05 ) ."
8397,CONCLUSIONS,Daily oral vitamin D2 doses up to 2000 IU were inadequate to maintain optimal 25OHD but were well tolerated .
8398,CONCLUSIONS,The finding of lower incidence of elevated inflammatory markers and cytokines among participants receiving higher vitamin D2 doses merits further study .
8399,BACKGROUND,"In the clinic setting both fasting levels of glucose and the area under the curve ( AUC ) of glucose , by determination of HbA1c levels , are used for risk assessments , in type 2 diabetes ( NIDDM ) ."
8400,BACKGROUND,"However little is known about postprandial levels , and hence AUC , regarding other traditional risk factors such as insulin and blood-lipids and how this is affected by different diets ."
8401,OBJECTIVE,"To study postprandial effects of three diets , during a single day , in NIDDM ."
8402,METHODS,"A low-fat diet ( 45-56 energy - % from carbohydrates ) , and a low-carbohydrate diet ( 16-24 energy - % from carbohydrates ) was compared with a Mediterranean-style diet ( black coffee for breakfast and the same total-caloric intake as the other two diets for lunch with red wine , 32-35 energy - % from carbohydrates ) in a randomized cross-over design ."
8403,METHODS,Total-caloric intake/test-day at the clinic from food was 1025-1080 kCal in men and 905-984 kCal in women .
8404,METHODS,The test meals were consumed at a diabetes ward under supervision .
8405,RESULTS,Twenty-one participants were recruited and 19 completed the studies .
8406,RESULTS,The low-carbohydrate diet induced lower insulin and glucose excursions compared with the low-fat diet ( p < 0.0005 for both AUC ) .
8407,RESULTS,"The insulin-response following the single Mediterranean-style lunch-meal was more pronounced than during the low-fat diet lunch ( insulin increase-ratio of the low-fat diet : 4.35 2.2 , of Mediterranean-style diet : 8.12 5.2 , p = 0.001 ) while postprandial glucose levels were similar ."
8408,RESULTS,"The increase-ratio of insulin correlated with the elevation of the incretin glucose-dependent insulinotropic-polypeptide following the Mediterranean-style diet lunch ( Spearman , r = 0.64 , p = 0.003 ) ."
8409,CONCLUSIONS,The large Mediterranean-style lunch-meal induced similar postprandial glucose-elevations as the low-fat meal despite almost double amount of calories due to a pronounced insulin-increase .
8410,CONCLUSIONS,This suggests that accumulation of caloric intake from breakfast and lunch to a single large Mediterranean style lunch-meal in NIDDM might be advantageous from a metabolic perspective .

8412,OBJECTIVE,"In the Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure ( EMPHASIS-HF ) , aldosterone blockade with eplerenone decreased mortality and hospitalisation in patients with mild symptoms ( New York Heart Association class II ) and chronic systolic heart failure ( HF ) ."
8413,OBJECTIVE,The present study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of eplerenone in the treatment of these patients in the UK and Spain .
8414,RESULTS,Results from the EMPHASIS-HF trial were used to develop a discrete-event simulation model estimating lifetime direct costs and effects ( life years and quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs ) gained ) of the addition of eplerenone to standard care among patients with chronic systolic HF and mild symptoms .
8415,RESULTS,"Eplerenone plus standard care compared with standard care alone increased lifetime direct costs per patient by 4284 for the UK and 7358 for Spain , with additional quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.22 QALYs for the UK and 1.33 QALYs for Spain ."
8416,RESULTS,Mean lifetime costs were 3520 per QALY in the UK and 5532 per QALY in Spain .
8417,RESULTS,Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested a 100 % likelihood of eplerenone being regarded as cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20000 per QALY ( UK ) or 30000 per QALY ( Spain ) .
8418,CONCLUSIONS,"By currently accepted standards of value for money , the addition of eplerenone to optimal medical therapy for patients with chronic systolic HF and mild symptoms is likely to be cost-effective ."
8419,OBJECTIVE,To assess the impact of anemia and iron deficiency on health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) in women treated for heavy menstrual bleeding ( HMB ) .
8420,METHODS,Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial .
8421,METHODS,Five university hospitals in Finland .
8422,METHODS,A total of 236 women referred for HMB .
8423,METHODS,Women were randomized to treatment with hysterectomy or a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system .
8424,METHODS,We defined groups based on women 's pretreatment hemoglobin [ hemoglobin < 120g/L ( anemic ) vs. hemoglobin 120g/L ( nonanemic ) ] and serum ferritin ( ferritin < 15g/L vs. 15g/L ) concentrations .
8425,METHODS,"HRQoL was compared between groups at baseline , 6 and 12months after treatment ."
8426,METHODS,Hemoglobin and ferritin were followed for 5years .
8427,METHODS,"HRQoL was measured by the RAND 36-item health survey ( RAND-36 ) , 5-Dimensional EuroQol and two questionnaires of mental wellbeing ."
8428,RESULTS,"At baseline , 63 women ( 27 % ) were anemic and 140 ( 60 % ) were severely iron deficient ( ferritin < 15g/L ) ."
8429,RESULTS,Only 8 % of the anemic women had taken iron supplementation .
8430,RESULTS,"Twelve months after treatment hemoglobin had increased in both hemoglobin groups , but was still significantly lower ( p < 0.001 ) in initially anemic women ( 128g/L ) compared with nonanemic women ( 136g/L ) ."
8431,RESULTS,"Twelve months after treatment three domain scores of RAND-36 increased more ( energy , p = 0.002 ; physical functioning , p = 0.04 ; social functioning , p = 0.05 ) , and anxiety ( p = 0.02 ) and depression scores ( p = 0.002 ) decreased more in anemic compared with nonanemic women ."
8432,RESULTS,Serum ferritin took 5years to reach normal levels .
8433,CONCLUSIONS,Improved HRQoL after treatment of HMB is associated with correction of anemia .
8434,CONCLUSIONS,Clinicians should actively screen for anemia in women with HMB and emphasize early iron substitution as an integral part of treatment .
8435,OBJECTIVE,People with diabetes frequently develop vascular disease .
8436,OBJECTIVE,We investigated the relationship between blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OH-D ) concentration and vascular disease risk in type 2 diabetes .
8437,METHODS,"The relationships between blood 25OH-D concentration at baseline and the incidence of macrovascular ( including myocardial infarction and stroke ) and microvascular ( retinopathy , nephropathy , neuropathy , and amputation ) disease were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regression in an observational study of patients in the 5-year Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes trial ."
8438,RESULTS,"A total of 50 % of the patients had low vitamin D concentrations , as indicated by median blood 25OH-D concentration of 49 nmol/L ."
8439,RESULTS,These patients with a blood 25OH-D concentration < 50 nmol/L had a higher cumulative incidence of macrovascular and microvascular events than those with levels 50 nmol/L .
8440,RESULTS,"Multivariate analysis , stratified by treatment and adjusted for relevant confounders , identified blood 25OH-D concentration as an independent predictor of macrovascular events ."
8441,RESULTS,"A 50 nmol/L difference in blood 25OH-D concentration was associated with a 23 % ( P = 0.007 ) change in risk of macrovascular complications during the study , and further adjustments for seasonality , hs-CRP , and physical activity level had little impact ."
8442,RESULTS,"The unadjusted risk of microvascular complications was 18 % ( P = 0.006 ) higher during the study , though the excess risk declined to 11-14 % and lost significance with adjustment for HbA1c , seasonality , or physical activity ."
8443,CONCLUSIONS,Low blood 25OH-D concentrations are associated with an increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular disease events in type 2 diabetes .
8444,CONCLUSIONS,"However , a causal link remains to be demonstrated ."
8445,BACKGROUND,Asthma clinical guidelines suggest written asthma action plans are essential for improving self-management and outcomes .
8446,OBJECTIVE,To assess the efficacy of written instructions in the form of a written asthma action plan provided by subspecialist physicians as part of usual asthma care during office visits .
8447,METHODS,A total of 407 children and adults with persistent asthma receiving first-time care in pulmonary and allergy practices at 4 urban medical centers were randomized to receive either written instructions ( n = 204 ) or no written instructions other than prescriptions ( n = 203 ) from physicians .
8448,RESULTS,"Using written asthma action plan forms as a vehicle for providing self-management instructions did not have a significant effect on any of the primary outcomes : ( 1 ) asthma symptom frequency , ( 2 ) emergency visits , or ( 3 ) asthma quality of life from baseline to 12-month follow-up ."
8449,RESULTS,"Both groups showed similar and significant reductions in asthma symptom frequency ( daytime symptoms [ P < 0.0001 ] , nocturnal symptoms [ P < 0.0001 ] , - agonist use [ P < 0.0001 ] ) ."
8450,RESULTS,There was also a significant reduction in emergency visits for the intervention ( P < 0.0001 ) and control ( P < 0.0006 ) groups .
8451,RESULTS,There was significant improvement in asthma quality-of-life scores for adults ( P < 0.0001 ) and pediatric caregivers ( P < 0.0001 ) .
8452,CONCLUSIONS,Our results suggest that using a written asthma action plan form as a vehicle for providing asthma management instructions to patients with persistent asthma who are receiving subspecialty care for the first time confers no added benefit beyond subspecialty-based medical care and education for asthma .

8454,BACKGROUND,Gentamicin is used as a therapeutic agent for Mnire 's disease because of its vestibulotoxicity causing chemo-ablation of the vestibular sensory epithelia .
8455,BACKGROUND,Its use has increased in recent years .
8456,BACKGROUND,"However , there is still no consensus about the dose regimen of gentamicin in the treatment of Mnire 's disease ."
8457,BACKGROUND,In this study two different dose regimen treatment protocols are compared in a placebo controlled study design .
8458,BACKGROUND,"The primary objective is to quantify the treatment effect on dizziness , the secondary objective is hearing evaluation ."
8459,METHODS,"We performed a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study in adults with unilateral Mnire 's disease according to the AAO-HNS guidelines resistant to conservative medication ."
8460,METHODS,"Three groups received four injections , administered weekly ( four intratympanic injections with 40mg/mL gentamicin solution , two injections gentamicin solution and two injections of placebo in random order , or four injections with placebo ) ."
8461,METHODS,Outcome measures were the score on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and pure tone audiometry ( PTA ) .
8462,METHODS,Intended follow-up was 2years .
8463,RESULTS,During follow-up one patient exceeded the accepted amount of hearing loss .
8464,RESULTS,"Further , enrollment was very slow ( until 12months between two patients ) and new insights showed an apparent benefit of intratympanic gentamicin treatment ( ITG ) ."
8465,RESULTS,Therefore we performed an unscheduled interim analysis which showed that PTA threshold shifts reached the stopping criteria in two more patients .
8466,RESULTS,"Because of this , this study was ended ."
8467,RESULTS,Of the three patients with the significant PTA threshold shift two were enrolled in the gentamicin group .
8468,CONCLUSIONS,No conclusions can be drawn concerning doses regimens .
8469,CONCLUSIONS,"Now that new publications have shown that ITG treatment can be an effective and safe treatment , a placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial may not pass the ethical committee because of these recent reports in literature ."

8473,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the availability of both dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate provides an opportunity to minimize adverse events in a pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) stimulant trial .
8474,METHODS,"Thirty-six medication-nave children 9-14 years of age , diagnosed with ADHD , were enrolled for 6 weeks in a crossover trial , with 2 weeks of methylphenidate , dextroamphetamine , and a placebo in a randomly assigned , counterbalanced sequence ."
8475,METHODS,"Barkley 's Side-Effect Rating Scale ( SERS ) , rated by parents , was used to assess adverse events ."
8476,METHODS,"SERS were available for 34 children , and data were analyzed both at the group and the single-subject level ."
8477,RESULTS,The side-effect profiles of dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate appeared similar at the group level .
8478,RESULTS,"Overall , insomnia and decreased appetite were the only adverse events associated with the stimulants as compared with placebo ."
8479,RESULTS,No significant increase from placebo to stimulant conditions was detected on SERS items reflecting emotional symptoms .
8480,RESULTS,"Furthermore , dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate did not differ from each other on any SERS item , except that dextroamphetamine was associated with higher severity of `` insomnia '' and a higher prevalence of `` unusually happy . ''"
8481,RESULTS,"Single-subject analyses showed that one or more adverse events were reported in 14 children ( 41 % ) , and were evenly distributed between those with dextroamphetamine as the drug that showed the greatest reduction in their ADHD symptoms ( `` best drug '' ) and those with methylphenidate as their best drug ."
8482,RESULTS,"Among children in whom both stimulants were associated with a decrease in ADHD symptoms , a clinically valid difference between the two stimulants in total adverse events score was found in 7 ( 39 % ) of the 18 cases ."
8483,RESULTS,"In these children , the availability of both stimulants provided an opportunity to minimize adverse events , while maintaining a reduction in ADHD symptoms ."
8484,CONCLUSIONS,The availability of both dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate may contribute to minimize adverse events in a subsample of children in pediatric ADHD stimulant trials .

8560,METHODS,The measurements were taken in the morning ( 10:00 -12:00 hours ) to avoid diurnal fluctuation .
8561,RESULTS,"The median foveal choroidal thickness at baseline was 337.00 m ( IQR 84.50 ) , which decreased to 311.00 m ( IQR 78.00 ) at 1 h following oral nicotine intake ( p = 0.001 ) ."
8562,RESULTS,The median choroidal thickness was also significantly decreased at five other extrafoveal points ( p < 0.05 for all ) .
8563,RESULTS,"In the control group , the median baseline choroidal thickness at the fovea was 330.50 m ( IQR 104.25 ) , and was 332.00 m ( IQR 103.75 ) at 1 h ( p = 0.271 ) ."
8564,CONCLUSIONS,Nicotine causes a significant decrease in choroidal thickness following oral intake .
8565,CONCLUSIONS,This acute decrease might be a result of reduced ocular blood flow due to the vasoconstrictive effect of nicotine .
8566,OBJECTIVE,To describe successful methods of recruitment and identify practice characteristics related to increased recruitment of older people for a randomised controlled trial .

8575,BACKGROUND,Complaints of knee pain secondary to early osteoarthritis may account for up to 30 % of visits to primary care physicians .
8576,BACKGROUND,"Due to the proposed inflammatory changes in early osteoarthritis , intra-articular injections of corticosteroids ( IACS ) have been considered as an option for disease progression modification , pain control , and improvement of function ."
8577,BACKGROUND,"However , some studies have suggested poor accuracy rates of IA injections depending on the entry site chosen ."
8578,BACKGROUND,It is therefore the aim of this study to evaluate the efficacy of IA knee corticosteroid injection in reducing pain and improving function in patients with early osteoarthritis and whether the low accuracy rates reported with the Anterolateral joint line injection site translate to worse functional and pain outcome measures as compared to Suprapatellar lateral injections .
8579,METHODS,"The study was carried out as an open-label , randomized controlled trial with 60 sequential patients recruited ."
8580,METHODS,Simple randomization separated groups into anterolateral joint line or suprapatellar lateral injection sites .
8581,METHODS,Improvements were measured with WOMAC and VAS scores after injection of Lidocaine and steroid solution .
8582,RESULTS,Patients receiving IACS injections had a measurable improvement in self-reported outcomes as evidenced by standard deviation change in WOMAC and VAS scores .
8583,RESULTS,"The majority of patients had a clinically significant improvement in VAS scores as compared to their initial measures with a notable amount of patients improving significantly as well on their WOMAC scores , irrespective of the injection site chosen ."
8584,CONCLUSIONS,We have therefore continued the use of palpation-guided intra-articular knee injections in an effort to reduce costs as compared to other injection modalities with positive results in our osteoarthritis patients .
8585,OBJECTIVE,Artificial ulcers remain a major complication after Endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) .
8586,OBJECTIVE,The development of more effective treatment regimen for this ulcer is required than the use of proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) alone .
8587,METHODS,Patients with ESD-derived artificial ulcers were randomly assigned to two groups : a group of patients who received rabeprazole 20 mg daily for 8 weeks ( PPI group ) and a group of patients who received a combination of rebamipide 300 mg daily for 8 weeks and rabeprazole 20 mg dairy for the first 4 weeks ( reb + PPI group ) .
8588,METHODS,"The area reduction ratio and healing status of ulcers were evaluated endoscopically on postoperative 7 , 28 and 56 days ."
8589,RESULTS,"The overall ulcer area reduction ratio was higher in the reb + PPI group than in the PPI group , especially at an early stage ."
8590,RESULTS,"The ratio of progression to the H1 stage in the reb + PPI group was significantly higher than that in the PPI group , especially at an early stage ."
8591,CONCLUSIONS,Treatment with 8 weeks of rebamipide plus the first 4 weeks of PPI demonstrated a reduction ratio of artificial ulcers superior to that with 8 weeks of PPI mono-therapy .
8592,CONCLUSIONS,"This combination treatment is , therefore , one of the candidate treatment strategies against ESD-derived artificial ulcers ."

8605,METHODS,"Concurrent medication data were collected from self-reported medication surveys , and their predicted effect on the pharmacokinetics of AChEIs was determined based on their known effects on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 enzyme activities ."
8606,RESULTS,"Among the 105 subjects enrolled , 72 % were female and 36 % were African American ."
8607,RESULTS,Subjects had a mean age of 79.6 years .
8608,RESULTS,The population used a mean of eight medications per day ( prescription and nonprescription ) .
8609,RESULTS,"The CYP2D6 activity score frequencies were 0 ( 3.8 % ) , 0.5 ( 4.8 % ) , 1.0 ( 36.2 % ) , 1.5-2 .0 ( 51.4 % ) , and > 2.0 ( 3.8 % ) ."
8610,RESULTS,"Nineteen subjects ( 18.1 % ) used a medication considered a strong or moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 , and eight subjects ( 7.6 % ) used a medication considered a strong or moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 ."
8611,RESULTS,"In total , 28.6 % of the study population was predicted to have reduced activity of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4/5 enzymes due to either genetic variants or concomitant medications ."
8612,CONCLUSIONS,Both pharmacogenetic variants and concurrent drug therapies that are predicted to alter the pharmacokinetics of AChEIs should be evaluated in older adults with AD .
8613,CONCLUSIONS,Pharmacogenetic and drug-interaction data may help personalize AD therapy and increase adherence by improving tolerability .
8614,OBJECTIVE,"In this study , our goal was to compare intraoperative and postoperative analgesic effects of lornoxicam and fentanyl when added to lidocaine Intravenous Regional Anesthesia ( IVRA ) in a group of outpatients who underwent hand surgery ."

8621,METHODS,Our primary outcome was first analgesic requirement time at postoperative period .
8622,RESULTS,"Lornoxicam added to lidocaine IVRA increased the sensory block recovery time without increasing side effects and increased first analgesic requirement time at the postoperative period when compared to lidocaine IVRA ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.001 respectively ) and fentanyl added to lidocaine IVRA ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.001 respectively ) ."
8623,RESULTS,"In addition , we also found that fentanyl decreased tourniquet pain ( p < 0.01 ) when compared to lidocaine but showed similar analgesic effect with lornoxicam ( p > 0.05 ) although VAS scores related to tourniquet pain were lower in fentanyl group ."
8624,RESULTS,Lornoxicam added to lidocaine IVRA was not superior to lidocaine IVRA in decreasing tourniquet pain .
8625,CONCLUSIONS,Addition of fentanyl to lidocaine IVRA seems to be superior to lidocaine IVRA and lornoxicam added to lidocaine IVRA groups in decreasing tourniquet pain at the expense of increasing side effects .
8626,CONCLUSIONS,"However , lornoxicam did not increase side effects while providing intraoperative and postoperative analgesia ."
8627,CONCLUSIONS,"Therefore , lornoxicam could be more appropriate for clinical use ."
8628,BACKGROUND,Employing waiting list control designs in psychological and behavioral intervention research may artificially inflate intervention effect estimates .
8629,BACKGROUND,"This exploratory randomized controlled trial tested this proposition in a study employing a brief intervention for problem drinkers , one domain of research in which waiting list control designs are used ."
8630,METHODS,All participants ( N = 185 ) were provided with brief personalized feedback intervention materials after being randomly allocated either to be told that they were in the intervention condition and that this was the intervention or to be told that they were in the waiting list control condition and that they would receive access to the intervention in four weeks with this information provided in the meantime .
8631,RESULTS,A total of 157 participants ( 85 % ) were followed-up after 4weeks .
8632,RESULTS,Between-group differences were found in one of four outcomes ( proportion within safe drinking guidelines ) .
8633,RESULTS,An interaction was identified between experimental manipulation and stage of change at study entry such that participant change was arrested among those more ready to change and told they were on the waiting list .
8634,CONCLUSIONS,"Trials with waiting list control conditions may overestimate treatment effects , though the extent of any such bias appears likely to vary between study populations ."
8635,CONCLUSIONS,Arguably they should only be used where this threat to valid inference has been carefully assessed .

8919,BACKGROUND,The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of long-pulsed Nd : YAG 1064 nm laser for treatment of toenails onychomycosis with fingernails onychomycosis .
8920,METHODS,One hundred and twelve affected fingernails or toenails in 37 patients with onychomycosis were randomized into Group 1 ( 22 patients with 50 affected fingernails ) and Group 2 ( 15 patients with 62 affected toenails ) .
8921,METHODS,"These patients were further classified into three subgroups ( Grade II , III , and IV ) according to Scoring Clinical Index of Onychomycosis ."
8922,METHODS,"All the affected nails were treated with long-pulse Nd : YAG 1064 nm laser intervention , once weekly , for continuous weeks , and were followed up for 24 weeks ."
8923,RESULTS,"The response rates at weeks 8 , 16 , and 24 were 0 , 0 and 52 % , respectively , for Group 1 , and 10 , 32 and 71 % for Group 2 ."
8924,RESULTS,The inter-group difference in efficacy was statistically significant ( P < 0.05 ) .
8925,RESULTS,"Even in the same subgroup , the response rate of Group 2 was higher than that of Group 1 ."
8926,CONCLUSIONS,The efficacy of long-pulsed Nd : YAG 1064 nm laser intervention against affected toenails is superior to that against fingernails .
8927,CONCLUSIONS,It is also effective for treatment of onychomycosis with different severity .
8928,BACKGROUND,Physical therapy is recommended for the management of axial spondyloarthritis ( axSpA ) and flexibility exercises have traditionally been the main focus .
8929,BACKGROUND,Cardiovascular ( CV ) diseases are considered as a major health concern in axSpA and there is strong evidence that endurance and strength exercise protects against CV diseases .
8930,BACKGROUND,"Therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of high intensity endurance and strength exercise on disease activity and CV health in patients with active axSpA ."
8931,METHODS,In a single blinded randomized controlled pilot study the exercise group ( EG ) performed 12 weeks of endurance and strength exercise while the control group ( CG ) received treatment as usual .
8932,METHODS,The primary outcome was the Ankylosing Spondylitis ( AS ) Disease Activity Score ( ASDAS ) .
8933,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes included patient reported disease activity ( Bath AS Disease Activity Index [ BASDAI ] ) , physical function ( Bath AS Functional Index [ BASFI ] ) , and CV risk factors measured by arterial stiffness ( Augmentation Index [ Alx ] ) and Pulse Wave Velocity [ PWV ] ) , cardiorespiratory fitness ( VO2 peak ) and body composition ."
8934,METHODS,"ANCOVA on the post intervention values with baseline values as covariates was used to assess group differences , and Mann Whitney U-test was used for outcomes with skewed residuals ."
8935,RESULTS,"Twenty-eight patients were included and 24 ( EG , n = 10 , CG , n = 14 ) completed the study ."
8936,RESULTS,"A mean treatment effect of -0.7 ( 95 % CI : -1.4 , 0.1 ) was seen in ASDAS score ."
8937,RESULTS,"Treatment effects were also observed in secondary outcomes ( mean group difference [ 95 % CI ] ) : BASDAI : -2.0 ( -3.6 , -0.4 ) , BASFI : -1.4 ( -2.6 , -0.3 ) , arterial stiffness ( estimated median group differences [ 95 % CI ] ) : AIx ( % ) : -5.3 ( -11.0 , -0.5 ) , and for PVW ( m/s ) : -0.3 ( -0.7 , 0.0 ) , VO2 peak ( ml/kg/min ) ( mean group difference [ 95 % CI ] : 3.7 ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) and trunk fat ( % ) : -1.8 ( -3.0 , -0.6 ) ."
8938,RESULTS,No adverse events occurred .
8939,CONCLUSIONS,High intensity exercise improved disease activity and reduced CV risk factors in patients with active axSpA .
8940,CONCLUSIONS,These effects will be further explored in a larger trial .

8942,OBJECTIVE,Low vitamin D status is linked to increased mortality and morbidity in patients who are critically ill .
8943,OBJECTIVE,It is unknown if this association is causal .
8944,OBJECTIVE,To investigate whether a vitamin D3 treatment regimen intended to restore and maintain normal vitamin D status over 6 months is of health benefit for patients in ICUs .
8945,METHODS,"A randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-center trial , conducted from May 2010 through September 2012 at 5 ICUs that included a medical and surgical population of 492 critically ill adult white patients with vitamin D deficiency ( 20 ng/mL ) assigned to receive either vitamin D3 ( n = 249 ) or a placebo ( n = 243 ) ."
8946,METHODS,"Vitamin D3 or placebo was given orally or via nasogastric tube once at a dose of 540,000 IU followed by monthly maintenance doses of 90,000 IU for 5 months ."
8947,METHODS,The primary outcome was hospital length of stay .
8948,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes included , among others , length of ICU stay , the percentage of patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels higher than 30 ng/mL at day 7 , hospital mortality , and 6-month mortality ."
8949,METHODS,A predefined severe vitamin D deficiency ( 12 ng/mL ) subgroup analysis was specified before data unblinding and analysis .
8950,RESULTS,A total of 475 patients were included in the final analysis ( 237 in the vitamin D3 group and 238 in the placebo group ) .
8951,RESULTS,"The median ( IQR ) length of hospital stay was not significantly different between groups ( 20.1 days [ IQR , 11.1-33 .3 ] for vitamin D3 vs 19.3 days [ IQR , 11.1-34 .9 ] for placebo ; P = .98 ) ."
8952,RESULTS,"Hospital mortality and 6-month mortality were also not significantly different ( hospital mortality : 28.3 % [ 95 % CI , 22.6 % -34.5 % ] for vitamin D3 vs 35.3 % [ 95 % CI , 29.2 % -41.7 % ] for placebo ; hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.81 [ 95 % CI , 0.58-1 .11 ] ; P = .18 ; 6-month mortality : 35.0 % [ 95 % CI , 29.0 % -41.5 % ] for vitamin D3 vs 42.9 % [ 95 % CI , 36.5 % -49.4 % ] for placebo ; HR , 0.78 [ 95 % CI , 0.58-1 .04 ] ; P = .09 ) ."
8953,RESULTS,"For the severe vitamin D deficiency subgroup analysis ( n = 200 ) , length of hospital stay was not significantly different between the 2 study groups : 20.1 days ( IQR , 12.9-39 .1 ) for vitamin D3 vs 19.0 days ( IQR , 11.6-33 .8 ) for placebo ."
8954,RESULTS,"Hospital mortality was significantly lower with 28 deaths among 98 patients ( 28.6 % [ 95 % CI , 19.9 % -38.6 % ] ) for vitamin D3 compared with 47 deaths among 102 patients ( 46.1 % [ 95 % CI , 36.2 % -56.2 % ] ) for placebo ( HR , 0.56 [ 95 % CI , 0.35-0 .90 ] , P for interaction = .04 ) , but not 6-month mortality ( 34.7 % [ 95 % CI , 25.4 % -45.0 % ] for vitamin D3 vs 50.0 % [ 95 % CI , 39.9 % -60.1 % ] for placebo ; HR , 0.60 [ 95 % CI , 0.39-0 .93 ] , P for interaction = .12 ) ."
8955,CONCLUSIONS,"Among critically ill patients with vitamin D deficiency , administration of high-dose vitamin D3 compared with placebo did not reduce hospital length of stay , hospital mortality , or 6-month mortality ."
8956,CONCLUSIONS,"Lower hospital mortality was observed in the severe vitamin D deficiency subgroup , but this finding should be considered hypothesis generating and requires further study ."

8958,OBJECTIVE,To assess the role of sexual relationships on levels and patterns of adherence to medication for pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV .
8959,METHODS,"We enrolled 1147 HIV-negative individuals in long-term serodiscordant relationships at 3 sites in Uganda from the Partners Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Study , a randomized placebo-controlled trial of daily oral tenofovir and emtricitabine/tenofovir ."
8960,METHODS,We used generalized estimation equations to assess the effects of sexual relationships on low adherence ( < 80 % ) and on gaps in adherence .
8961,RESULTS,"Fifty-three percent were male , 51 % were 18-34 years and 24 % were polygamous ."
8962,RESULTS,"Participants who reported sex in the past month with someone other than their primary partner and with < 100 % condom use were more than twice as likely to have low adherence [ adjusted odds ratio ( aOR ) = 2.48 , 95 % CI : 1.70 to 3.62 ] compared with those who had sex with only their primary partners and 100 % condom use ."
8963,RESULTS,"Using the same reference group , those who abstained from sex in the previous month had 30 % increased odds of low adherence ( aOR = 1.30 , 95 % CI : 1.05 to 1.62 ) and participants in nonpolygamous marriages who reported sex with both their primary and other partners and < 100 % condom use were almost twice as likely to be low adherers ( aOR = 1.76 , 95 % CI : 1.01 to 3.08 ) ."
8964,RESULTS,At least one 72-hour gap in adherence was seen in 598 participants ( 54.7 % ) ; 23.2 % had at least one 1-week gap .
8965,CONCLUSIONS,"Risk of low overall adherence was higher in participants who reported sex outside primary partnerships and suboptimal condom use , as well as in those who abstained from sex ."
8966,CONCLUSIONS,"Adherence gaps were common , potentially creating risk for HIV acquisition ."

8986,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this study was to assess the time of onset and time course of efficacy over 12.0 hours of extended-release multilayer bead formulation of methylphenidate ( MPH-MLR ) compared with placebo in children 6-12 years of age with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) in a laboratory school setting .
8987,METHODS,This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study included children 6-12 years of age with ADHD .
8988,METHODS,Enrolled children went through four study phases : 1 ) Screening period ( 4 weeks ) and a 2 day medication washout period ; 2 ) open-label period with dose initiation of MPH-MLR 15mg daily and individual dose optimization treatment period ( 2-4 weeks ) ; 3 ) double-blind crossover period in which participants were randomized to sequences ( 1 week each ) of placebo and the optimized MPH-MLR dose given daily ; and 4 ) follow-up safety call .
8989,METHODS,Analog classroom time course evaluations were performed at the end of each double-blind week .
8990,METHODS,"The primary efficacy end-point was the mean of the on-treatment/postdose Swanson , Kotkin , Agler , M-Flynn , and Pelham ( SKAMP ) - Total scores over time points collected 1.0-12 .0 hours after dosing ."
8991,METHODS,End-points were evaluated using a mixed-effects analysis of covariance .
8992,RESULTS,The evaluable population included 20 participants .
8993,RESULTS,"The least-squares mean postdose SKAMP-Total score was higher for placebo than for MPH-MLR ( 2.18 vs. 1.32 , respectively ; p = 0.0001 ) , indicating fewer symptoms with MPH-MLR therapy than with placebo ."
8994,RESULTS,No difference in SKAMP-Total score between participants who received sequence 1 or sequence 2 was noted .
8995,RESULTS,"From each of hours 1.0-12 .0 , least-squares mean SKAMP-Total score was significantly lower for those receiving MPH-MLR than for those receiving placebo ( p0 .0261 ) ."
8996,RESULTS,Neither serious adverse events nor new or unexpected safety findings were noted during the study .
8997,CONCLUSIONS,"MPH-MLR showed a significant decrease in SKAMP scores compared with placebo in children with ADHD 6-12 years of age , indicating a decrease in ADHD symptoms ."

9017,METHODS,"Twenty volunteers with quiescent AD ( no active signs for 6months ) participated in a randomized observer-blind study , wherein BMVc was applied to one forearm and TACo to the other , twice daily for 4weeks ."
9018,METHODS,The biophysical/biological properties of the stratum corneum were assessed before and after treatment .
9019,METHODS,Nine volunteers with active disease and 10 with healthy skin were assessed at untreated sites .
9020,RESULTS,"BMVc significantly reduced skin barrier function , integrity and cohesion , and the levels of pyrrolidone carboxylic acid ( PCA ) and urocanic acid ( UCA ) towards the subclinical barrier defect observed in patients with AD ( nonlesional sites ) ."
9021,RESULTS,"TACo preserved skin barrier function , integrity , cohesion and PCA and UCA levels , while significantly increasing skin hydration to levels comparable with healthy skin ."
9022,RESULTS,"Both treatments reduced skin surface pH and trypsin-like protease activity , with TACo doing so to a significantly greater degree ."
9023,CONCLUSIONS,"In quiescent AD , 4weeks of BMVc treatment adversely affected the biophysical properties of the skin and reduced the levels of natural moisturizing factor , whereas TACo improved the condition of the skin barrier ."
9024,BACKGROUND,Mental and physical fatigue while at work is common among emergency medical services ( EMS ) shift workers .
9025,BACKGROUND,Extended shifts ( for example 24 hours ) and excessive amounts of overtime work increase the likelihood of negative safety outcomes and pose a challenge for EMS fatigue-risk management .
9026,BACKGROUND,"Text message-based interventions are a potentially high-impact , low-cost platform for sleep and fatigue assessment and distributing information to workers at risk of negative safety outcomes related to sleep behaviors and fatigue ."
9027,METHODS,We will conduct a pilot randomized trial with a convenience sample of adult EMS workers recruited from across the United States using a single study website .
9028,METHODS,Participants will be allocated to one of two possible arms for a 90-day study period .
9029,METHODS,"The intervention arm will involve text message assessments of sleepiness , fatigue , and difficulty with concentration at the beginning , during , and end of scheduled shifts ."
9030,METHODS,Intervention subjects reporting high levels of sleepiness or fatigue will receive one of four randomly selected intervention messages promoting behavior change during shiftwork .
9031,METHODS,Control subjects will receive assessment only text messages .
9032,METHODS,We aim to determine the performance characteristics of a text messaging tool for the delivery of a sleep and fatigue intervention .
9033,METHODS,We seek to determine if a text messaging program with tailored intervention messages is effective at reducing perceived sleepiness and/or fatigue among emergency medicine clinician shift workers .
9034,METHODS,"Additional aims include testing whether a theory-based behavioral intervention , delivered by text message , changes ` alertness behaviors ' ."
9035,CONCLUSIONS,The SleepTrackTXT pilot trial could provide evidence of compliance and effectiveness that would support rapid widespread expansion in one of two forms : 1 ) a stand-alone program in the form of a tailored/individualized sleep monitoring and fatigue reduction support service for EMS workers ; or 2 ) an add-on to a multi-component fatigue risk management program led and maintained by employers or by safety and risk management services .

9092,OBJECTIVE,"We , therefore , examined the effects of aerobic exercise and/or metformin on incretin hormones ."
9093,METHODS,Ten participants with type 2 diabetes were recruited for this randomized crossover study .
9094,METHODS,"Metformin or placebo was given for 28 days , followed by the alternate treatment for 28 days ."
9095,METHODS,"On the last 2 days of each condition , participants were assessed during a non-exercise day and a subsequent exercise day ."
9096,METHODS,Aerobic exercise took place in the morning and blood samples were taken in the subsequent hours ( before and after lunch ) .
9097,RESULTS,Aerobic exercise did not increase total plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) in the pre - or post-lunch periods ( all p > 0.1 ) .
9098,RESULTS,GLP-1 was higher in the pre-lunch ( p = 0.016 ) and post-lunch ( p = 0.018 ) periods of the metformin conditions compared with the placebo .
9099,RESULTS,"Total plasma GIP was higher in the pre-lunch period ( p = 0.05 ) , but not in the post-lunch period ( p = 0.95 ) , with metformin compared with placebo ."
9100,CONCLUSIONS,"In contrast to our hypothesis , aerobic exercise did not acutely increase total GLP-1 and GIP levels in patients with type 2 diabetes ."
9101,CONCLUSIONS,"Metformin , independent of exercise , significantly increased total plasma GLP-1 and GIP concentrations in these patients ."
9102,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of two exercise programs on lower extremity function in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis .
9103,METHODS,Thirty patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis participated in this study .
9104,METHODS,"Pain , passive range of motion , muscle strength , balance , and functional abilities were assessed with the Numeric Rating Scale , goniometer , handheld dynamometer , Flamingo Balance Test , Functional Reach Test , 10-meter walking test , 10-stair climbing test , and Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire ."
9105,METHODS,"Participants were randomly assigned to the strengthening exercise group ( group 1 , n = 15 ) or the proprioceptive-balance exercise group ( group 2 , n = 15 ) ."
9106,RESULTS,Intragroup analysis showed statistically significant improvements in all outcome measures except muscle strength in the hip and ankle after strengthening exercises in group 1 .
9107,RESULTS,"However , statistically significant improvements were found in all outcome measures after the proprioceptive-balance exercises in group 2 ."
9108,RESULTS,"Intergroup analysis showed statistically significant improvement in all outcome measures in group 2 except for the Numeric Rating Scale , Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire , and passive range of motion scores and hip extension and knee flexion muscle strengths ."
9109,CONCLUSIONS,This study demonstrates that exercise treatment significantly improves musculoskeletal symptoms in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis .
9110,CONCLUSIONS,"However , balance-proprioceptive exercises prove to be effective more than strengthening exercises for improving lower extremity function such as walking , climbing stairs , and balance in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis ."
9111,OBJECTIVE,A high-frequency steady-state visual evoked potential ( SSVEP ) has been suggested for the reduction of eye fatigue for SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces ( BCIs ) .
9112,OBJECTIVE,"However , the poor performance of high-frequency SSVEP requires a novel stimulus of better performance even with low eye fatigue ."
9113,OBJECTIVE,"As an alternative to the high-frequency SSVEP , we explore the SSVEP response to an amplitude-modulated stimulus ( AM-SSVEP ) to verify its availability for brain-computer interfaces ( BCIs ) ."
9114,METHODS,An amplitude-modulated stimulus was generated as the product of two sine waves at a carrier frequency ( fc ) and a modulating frequency ( fm ) .
9115,METHODS,"The carrier frequency was higher than 40 Hz to reduce eye fatigue , and the modulating frequency ranged around the - band ( 9-12 Hz ) to utilize low-frequency harmonic information ."
9116,METHODS,"Four targets were used in combinations of three different modulating frequencies and two different carrier frequencies in the offline experiment , and two additional targets were added with one additional modulating and one carrier frequency in online experiments ."
9117,RESULTS,"In the AM-SSVEP spectra , seven harmonic components were identified at 2fc , 2fm , fcfm , fc3fm , and 2fc-4fm ."
9118,RESULTS,"Using an optimized combination of the harmonic frequencies , online experiments demonstrated that the accuracy of the AM-SSVEP was equivalent to that of the low-frequency SSVEP ."
9119,RESULTS,"Furthermore , subject evaluation indicated that an AM stimulus caused lower eye fatigue and less sensing of flickering than a low-frequency stimulus , in a manner similar to a high-frequency stimulus ."
9120,CONCLUSIONS,"The actual stimulus frequencies of AM-SSVEPs are in the high-frequency band , resulting in reduced eye fatigue ."
9121,CONCLUSIONS,"Furthermore , AM-SSVEPs can utilize both fundamental stimulus frequencies and non-integer harmonic frequencies including low frequencies for SSVEP recognition ."
9122,CONCLUSIONS,The feasibility of AM-SSVEP with high BCI performance and low eye fatigue was confirmed through offline and online experiments .
9123,CONCLUSIONS,"AM-SSVEPs combine the advantages of both low - and high-frequency SSVEPs -- high power and low eye fatigue , respectively ."
9124,CONCLUSIONS,"AM-SSVEP-based BCI systems exploit these advantages , making them promising for application in practical BCI systems ."
9125,BACKGROUND,The use of supplemental oxygen in the setting of suspected acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) is recommended in international treatment guidelines and established in prehospital and hospital clinical routine throughout the world .
9126,BACKGROUND,"However , to date there is no conclusive evidence from adequately designed and powered trials supporting this practice ."
9127,BACKGROUND,Existing data are conflicting and fail to clarify the role of supplemental oxygen in AMI .

9129,METHODS,"Patient inclusion and randomization will take place at first medical contact , either before hospital admission or at the emergency department ."
9130,METHODS,"The Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies registry will be used for online randomization , allowing inclusion of a broad population of all-comers ."
9131,METHODS,Follow-up will be carried out in nationwide health registries and Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies .
9132,METHODS,The primary objective is to evaluate whether oxygen reduces 1-year all-cause mortality .
9133,METHODS,"Secondary end points include 30-day mortality , major adverse cardiac events , and health economy ."
9134,METHODS,Prespecified subgroups include patients with confirmed AMI and certain risk groups .
9135,METHODS,"In a 3-month pilot study , the study concept was found to be safe and feasible ."
9136,CONCLUSIONS,The need to clarify the uncertainty of the role of supplemental oxygen therapy in the setting of suspected AMI is urgent .
9137,CONCLUSIONS,The DETO2X-AMI trial is designed and powered to address this important issue and may have a direct impact on future recommendations .
9138,BACKGROUND,"Despite the intensive global efforts to control intestinal parasitic infections , the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) infections is still very high in many developing countries particularly among children in rural areas ."
9139,METHODS,"A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 250 Aboriginal schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation ( 200,000 IU ) on STH reinfection ."
9140,METHODS,The effect of the supplement was assessed at 3 and 6 months after receiving interventions ; after a complete 3-day deworming course of 400 mg/daily of albendazole tablets .
9141,RESULTS,Almost all children ( 98.6 % ) were infected with at least one STH species .
9142,RESULTS,"The overall prevalence of ascariasis , trichuriasis and hookworm infection was 67.8 % , 95.5 % and 13.4 % , respectively ."
9143,RESULTS,"Reinfection rates of Ascaris , Trichuris and hookworm were high ; at 6 months , assessment reached 80 % of the prevalence reported before treatment ."
9144,RESULTS,There were no significant differences in the reinfection rates and intensities of STH between vitamin A supplemented-children and those who received placebo at 3 and 6 months ( p > 0.05 ) .
9145,CONCLUSIONS,Vitamin A supplementation showed no protective effect against STH reinfection and this could be due to the high endemicity of STH in this community .
9146,CONCLUSIONS,"Long-term interventions to reduce poverty will help significantly in reducing this continuing problem and there is no doubt that reducing intestinal parasitic infection would have a positive impact on the health , nutrition and education of these children ."
9147,BACKGROUND,This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00936091 .
9148,BACKGROUND,Diet and lifestyle modification is commonly used in constipation management .
9149,BACKGROUND,"As there is a dearth of studies on this topic in Malaysia , we aim to elucidate the relations between stool patterns , dietary intake and physical activity levels among adults with functional constipation ."
9150,METHODS,"From a database collected via surveys at public events , a convenience sample of 100 adults diagnosed with Rome II-defined functional constipation was enrolled in this cross-sectional study ."
9151,METHODS,"After severity assessment using the Chinese Constipation Questionnaire , subjects completed 2-week bowel movement diaries to determine stool frequency , consistency and output ."
9152,METHODS,"Dietary intake and physical activity levels were assessed twice using three-day 24-hour diet recalls and International Physical Activity Questionnaire , respectively ."

9156,RESULTS,The majority of subjects were physically inactive .
9157,RESULTS,"Stool frequency and output were positively associated with dietary fibre ( r ( s ) = 0.278 , P < 0.01 ; r ( s ) = 0.226 , P < 0.05 ) and fluid intake ( r ( s ) = 0.257 , P < 0.05 ; OR = 3.571 , 95 % CI [ 1.202-10 .609 ] ) ."
9158,RESULTS,"Constipation severity was associated with higher physical activity levels ( OR = 2.467 , 95 % CI [ 1.054-5 .777 ] ) ."
9159,CONCLUSIONS,Insufficient intake of dietary fibre and fluid are associated with aggravated constipation symptoms .
9160,CONCLUSIONS,"Further studies are necessary to confirm usefulness of dietary intervention in treatment of constipation as dietary factors alone may not influence overall severity and stool consistency , an integral element of constipation ."

9184,BACKGROUND,Images depicting morbidly obese models [ i.e. body mass index ( BMI ) > 40 ] often accompany media articles about the health risks of being overweight ( i.e. BMI 25-30 ) .
9185,BACKGROUND,"Little is known about the effect of this mismatch on people 's understanding of risk , and perceptions of message relevance ."
9186,METHODS,"In total , 563 participants ( 291 overweight/obese and 272 healthy weight ) were randomly allocated to read a health message about the risk of heart disease posed by being overweight , presented alongside ( i ) a photo of an overweight model , ( ii ) a morbidly obese model or ( iii ) no photo ."
9187,METHODS,"Between-group differences in the primary outcomes of message relevance , and the body size perceived to be ` at risk ' , were assessed , and the potential moderating effects of motivation , weight concern and existing risk knowledge explored ."
9188,RESULTS,"Overweight and obese participants in the exaggerated ( morbidly obese ) image condition interpreted health risks to relate to a larger body size than those who saw no image ( F ( 2 , 290 ) = 4.06 , P = 0.02 ) ."
9189,RESULTS,"There was no experimental effect on perceived personal relevance ( F ( 2 , 290 ) = 0.25 , P = 0.38 ) ."
9190,RESULTS,"No significant moderation effects were detected , and there was no effect of study condition in healthy weight participants for either outcome ."
9191,CONCLUSIONS,"The findings suggest that the use of morbidly obese models in messages regarding the health risks of being overweight may undermine the impact of these messages among those who they most aim to reach ; the reader may perceive a reduced risk of being ` only ' overweight , and that a higher weight is needed for the negative effects of excess weight to occur ."

9253,BACKGROUND,Oral antibiotics use in infants in developing countries is challenging because liquid formulations are often unavailable .
9254,BACKGROUND,"However , dissolving solid formulation of drugs in water poses a risk of gastrointestinal infection ."
9255,BACKGROUND,"Although mother 's milk may be a potential vehicle , no evidence exists to indicate that antibiotics dissolved in human milk are bioequivalent to those dissolved in water ."
9256,BACKGROUND,"Therefore , we compared pharmacokinetic parameters of an orally administered antibiotic , amoxicillin , dissolved in human milk , to those of water-dissolved amoxicillin ."
9257,METHODS,A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 healthy adult volunteers in a randomised crossover design .
9258,METHODS,"Marketed amoxicillin powder for suspension was dissolved in either human milk or water at a final concentration of 50 mg/mL , and 10 mL was given orally in a fasting state ."
9259,METHODS,Timed blood samples were obtained and plasma amoxicillin was quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry .
9260,RESULTS,"Results showed that pharmacokinetic parameters , including area-under-the-curve , Cmax and half-life of the water-based and milk-based amoxicillin administration were not significantly different ."
9261,RESULTS,"90 % CIs of the ratios of these parameters in concomitant breast milk administration to those of water were within 89 % and 116 % , suggesting they are bioequivalent ( defined as a range between 80 % and 125 % ) ."
9262,CONCLUSIONS,We conclude that oral administration of amoxicillin dissolved in human milk at 50 mg/mL results in pharmacokinetics profiles comparable to amoxicillin dissolved in water .
9263,CONCLUSIONS,"Pharmaceutical interactions between amoxicillin and breast milk are unlikely , suggesting no need to modify dosing schedules ."

9268,METHODS,Subjects in the treatment group received EN with an initial rate defined according to the total volume and the infusion rate was adjusted based on gastric residual volume ( GRV ) assessed every 4 hours .
9269,METHODS,Subjects of the control group received EN without monitoring the GRV and reached the target infusion volume within 72 hours .
9270,METHODS,The incidence of reflux and aspiration was recorded .
9271,RESULTS,"The incidences of regurgitation and aspiration were significantly lower in treatment group ( 6.3 % and 7.9 % , respectively ) than control group ( 18.8 % and 17.5 % , respectively ) ."
9272,RESULTS,"In the treatment group , 1 patient developed regurgitation while 2 developed aspiration when EN was 500 mL ."
9273,RESULTS,"When EN increased to 1000 mL , 2 patients developed regurgitation and 2 developed aspiration , and 5 patients developed regurgitation and 6 had aspiration when EN was 1500 mL ."

9276,OBJECTIVE,Acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality but the relationship between LVEF and outcomes is unclear .
9277,OBJECTIVE,We explored the association between LVEF and 30 and 180day mortality in 7007 ADHF patients enrolled in the Acute Studies of Nesiritide in Decompensated Heart Failure ( ASCEND-HF ) trial .
9278,RESULTS,We explored the association between LVEF and 30 and 180 day mortality in 7007 ADHF patients enrolled in the Acute Studies of Nesiritide in Decompensated Heart Failure ( ASCEND-HF ) trial .
9279,RESULTS,"LVEF was analysed both as a continuous variable and according to three categories : < 40 % ( LowEF ) , 40-50 % [ intermediate EF ( IntEF ) ] , and > 50 % [ preserved ejection fraction ( PresEF ) ] ."
9280,RESULTS,"Of the patients in the trial , 4474 ( 78.7 % ) had LowEF , 674 ( 11.9 % ) had IntEF , and 539 ( 9.5 % ) had PresEF ."
9281,RESULTS,"The unadjusted 30 and 180 day mortality was similar for LowEF ( 3.7 % , 12.3 % ) , IntEF ( 3.4 % , 13.1 % ) , and PresEF ( 4.3 % , 14.1 % ) , respectively ( P > 0.05 ) ."
9282,RESULTS,"After multivariable adjustment , the hazard ratio ( HR ) for 180 day mortality remained similar for the LowEF [ HR 0.96 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.75-1 .24 ; P = 0.77 ] and IntEF ( 0.91 , 95 % CI 0.66-1 .3 ; P = 0.58 ) compared to PresEF patients ."
9283,RESULTS,"By contrast , when LVEF was evaluated as a continuous measure , it exhibited a U-shaped pattern with mortality ."
9284,RESULTS,"After matching for age and sex , the mortality risk attributed to LVEF was attenuated , as the LVEF increased as a continuous variable over 35 % ."
9285,RESULTS,"However , in patients with EF < 35 % , the mortality risk continue to increase as the LVEF declined ."
9286,CONCLUSIONS,"Among patients with ADHF , the unadjusted mortality rates are similar across LVEF strata ."
9287,CONCLUSIONS,"However , after accounting for key patient variables , the mortality risk increases as EF falls below 35 % ."
9288,CONCLUSIONS,These data will be useful in planning future studies of ADHF .

9303,OBJECTIVE,"However , there have been concerns about possible reduced viral efficacy of efavirenz in children exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission ."
9304,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate whether nevirapine-exposed children achieving initial viral suppression with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy can transition to efavirenz-based therapy without risk of viral failure .
9305,METHODS,"Randomized , open-label noninferiority trial conducted at Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital , Johannesburg , South Africa , from June 2010 to December 2013 , enrolling 300 HIV-infected children exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission who were aged 3 years or older and had plasma HIV RNA of less than 50 copies/mL during ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy ; 298 were randomized and 292 ( 98 % ) were followed up to 48 weeks after randomization ."
9306,METHODS,Participants were randomly assigned to switch to efavirenz-based therapy ( n = 150 ) or continue ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy ( n = 148 ) .
9307,METHODS,"Risk difference between groups in ( 1 ) viral rebound ( ie , 1 HIV RNA measurement of > 50 copies/mL ) and ( 2 ) viral failure ( ie , confirmed HIV RNA > 1000 copies/mL ) with a noninferiority bound of -0.10 ."
9308,METHODS,Immunologic and clinical responses were secondary end points .
9309,RESULTS,The Kaplan-Meier probability of viral rebound by 48 weeks was 0.176 ( n = 26 ) in the efavirenz group and 0.284 ( n = 42 ) in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group .

9345,OBJECTIVE,Evidences from cultured cells and animal models of ischemia suggest that lithium has neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects and may play a desirable role in reducing infarct volume and even improving the brain insults from stroke .
9346,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of lithium in early motor recovery of patients after ischemic stroke .
9347,METHODS,"Eighty patients with first ever stroke , allocated randomly in lithium , 300 mg twice daily , or placebo ."
9348,METHODS,Treatment was initiated 48 hours after stroke and continued for 30 days .
9349,METHODS,Modified National Institute of Health Stroke Scale ( mNIHSS ) and hand subsection of Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( hFMA ) were used to evaluate impairment on the fifth and 30th day of treatment .
9350,RESULTS,Sixty-six subjects ( 32 subjects in the lithium group and 34 subjects in the placebo group ) completed the study .
9351,RESULTS,There were no significant differences in the improvement in mNIHSS ( P = 0.40 ) and hFMA ( P = 0.07 ) after 30 days .

9356,BACKGROUND,Fitzpatrick 's classification is the most common way of assessing skin UV sensitivity .
9357,BACKGROUND,"The study aim was to investigate how self-estimated and actual UV sensitivity , as measured by phototest , are associated with attitudes towards sunbathing and the propensity to increase sun protection , as well as the correlation between self-estimated and actual UV sensitivity ."
9358,METHODS,A total of 166 primary healthcare patients filled-out a questionnaire investigating attitudes towards sunbathing and the propensity to increase sun protection .
9359,METHODS,"They reported their skin type according to Fitzpatrick , and a UV sensitivity phototest was performed ."
9360,RESULTS,"Self-rated low UV sensitivity ( skin type III-VI ) was associated with a more positive attitude towards sunbathing and a lower propensity to increase sun protection , compared to high UV sensitivity ."
9361,RESULTS,The correlation between the two methods was weak .
9362,CONCLUSIONS,The findings might indicate that individuals with a perceived low but in reality high UV sensitivity do not seek adequate sun protection with regard to skin cancer risk .
9363,CONCLUSIONS,"Furthermore , the poor correlation between self-reported and actual UV sensitivity , measured by phototest , makes the clinical use of Fitzpatrick 's classification questionable ."

9450,METHODS,"Efficacy endpoints at week 104 included change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) and systolic blood pressure , and percent change from baseline in body weight and fasting plasma lipids ."
9451,METHODS,Safety was assessed by adverse event ( AE ) reports .
9452,RESULTS,"At week 104 , canagliflozin 100 and 300mg were associated with reductions in HbA1c versus placebo ( -0.32 and -0.43 % vs 0.17 % , respectively ; overall mean baseline , 7.7 % ) and more patients achieved HbA1c < 7.0 % with canagliflozin 100 and 300mg than with placebo ( 35.8 and 41.9 % vs 20.3 % , respectively ) ."
9453,RESULTS,"Reductions in FPG , body weight and systolic blood pressure , and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) were seen with canagliflozin compared with placebo ."
9454,RESULTS,"The overall incidence rates of AEs over 104weeks were 88.0 , 89.8 and 86.1 % with canagliflozin 100 and 300mg and placebo , respectively ; serious AE rates were low across treatment groups ."
9455,RESULTS,"The incidence rates of urinary tract infections , genital mycotic infections and osmotic diuresis - and volume depletion-related AEs were higher with canagliflozin than with placebo ."
9456,CONCLUSIONS,"Canagliflozin improved glycaemic control , reduced body weight and systolic blood pressure , and was generally well tolerated in patients aged 55-80years with T2DM over 104weeks ."
9457,BACKGROUND,Thalidomide use in cutaneous sarcoidosis is based on data from small case series or case reports .
9458,BACKGROUND,The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of thalidomide in severe cutaneous sarcoidosis .
9459,METHODS,"This study consisted of a randomized , double-bind , parallel , placebo-controlled , investigator-masked , multicenter trial lasting 3 months and an open-label study from month 3 to month 6 ."
9460,METHODS,Adults with a clinical and histologic diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis were included in nine hospital centers in France .
9461,METHODS,Patients were randomized 1:1 to oral thalidomide ( 100 mg once daily ) or to a matching oral placebo for 3 months .
9462,METHODS,"In the course of an open-label follow-up from month 3 to month 6 , all patients received thalidomide , 100 mg to 200 mg daily ."
9463,METHODS,"The proportions of patients with a partial or complete cutaneous response at month 3 , based on at least a 50 % improvement in three target lesions scored for area and infiltration , were compared across randomization groups ."
9464,RESULTS,The intent-to-treat population included 39 patients .
9465,RESULTS,None of them had a complete cutaneous response .
9466,RESULTS,"Four out of 20 patients in the thalidomide group ( 20 % ) vs four out of 19 patients in the placebo group ( 21 % ) had a partial cutaneous response at month 3 ( difference in proportion of -1 % [ 95 % CI , -26 % to +24 % ] for thalidomide vs placebo , P = 1.0 ) ."
9467,RESULTS,Eight patients with side effects were recorded in the thalidomide group vs three in the placebo group .
9468,RESULTS,"We observed a large number of adverse event-related discontinuations in patients taking thalidomide in the first 3 months ( four patients with thalidomide , zero with placebo ) and in the 3 following months ( five patients ) ."
9469,CONCLUSIONS,"At a dose of 100 mg daily for 3 months , our results do not encourage thalidomide use in cutaneous sarcoidosis ."

9471,OBJECTIVE,To assess whether medical record documentation reflects actual home practices regarding the administration of preventive medications to urban children with persistent asthma .
9472,METHODS,Baseline data from a prompting asthma intervention were used for this cross-sectional analysis .
9473,METHODS,"As part of the larger study , we enrolled children ( 2-12 years ) with persistent asthma in the waiting room at 12 primary care offices ( 2009-2012 ) ."
9474,METHODS,"Prior to their visit with a healthcare provider , caregivers reported information regarding their child 's asthma symptom severity and current preventive medications ( i.e. name and frequency of use ) ."
9475,METHODS,"We compared caregiver-reported medication information with medical record data to determine the rate of complete concordance , defined as total consistency between the prescribed medication data documented in the medical record and parent report describing how the child is actually using the medication at home ."
9476,RESULTS,"According to 310 completed medical record reviews , 194 ( 62 % ) children had a current prescription for a daily preventive asthma medication ."
9477,RESULTS,"Of these children , 110 ( 57 % ) had caregivers who reported complete concordance ."
9478,RESULTS,"Those reporting complete concordance were more likely to have children with greater symptom severity , including fewer symptom-free days in the prior two weeks ( 6.9 vs. 8.7 , p = 0.018 ) , and 1 asthma-related hospitalization in the prior year ( 16 % vs. 6 % , p = 0.042 ) ."
9479,CONCLUSIONS,"Medical records may poorly reflect actual home practices and providers should specifically inquire about medication use and barriers to adherence at the time of an office visit to promote guideline-based , consistent treatment for children with persistent asthma ."
9480,OBJECTIVE,To determine the pathological mechanism and prevent heart-renal syndrome after heart valve replacement surgery .
9481,METHODS,"A total of 46 patients were admitted for selective valve replacement , and divide into 3 groups randomly : a control group ( Con , n = 16 ) , a remote ischemic perconditioning ( RIPerC ) group ( n = 15 ) and a remote ischemic postconditioning ( RIPostC ) group ( n = 15 ) ."
9482,METHODS,"The serum creatinine ( SCr ) , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , serum heme oxygennase-1 ( HO-1 ) , serum iron and urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) level in the 3 groups were compared preoperatively and 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 h after aortic cross-release ."
9483,RESULTS,"Compared with the preoperative level , the SCr , BUN , urinary NGAL , serum iron ( 6 and 12 h ) and serum HO-1 values were significantly increased after the heart valve replacement surgery in the control patients , RIPreC and RIPostC groups ( P < 0.05 ) ."
9484,RESULTS,"Compared with the control group , the serum HO-1 was significantly increased at 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 h after the heart valve replacement surgery in both the RIPerC and RIPostC groups ( P < 0.05 ) ; the SCr , BUN , urinary NGAL and serum iron values were decreased at 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 h after the heart valve replacement surgery in both the RIPerC and RIPostC groups ( P > 0.05 ) ."
9485,CONCLUSIONS,"Abnormal change in urinary NGAL , serum iron and HO-1 can be used as early warning indicators of acute kidney injury when cardio-renal syndrome occurrs among patients under heart valve replacement surgery ."
9486,CONCLUSIONS,Remote ischemic conditioning plays a preventive role in the occurrence of cardio-renal syndrome and renal protection .
9487,BACKGROUND,The autobiographical Implicit Association Test ( aIAT ) is a variant of the Implicit Association Test reportedly capable of detecting an individual 's concealed autobiographical event with very high accuracy .
9488,BACKGROUND,A previous attempt to utilize this measurement technique for the identification of cocaine users rendered an alarming rate of false positives .
9489,BACKGROUND,"In this study , we aimed to explore the potential reasons behind the measurement 's inaccuracy ."
9490,METHODS,Two versions of the cocaine aIAT were devised with different category labels ( descriptive ` guilty/innocent ' and self-referenced ` as if you were/were not ' ) .
9491,METHODS,Forty-one cocaine abstinent participants ( 43.9 % male ; mean age = 28.17 7.36 ) were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions .
9492,METHODS,Self-declared cocaine abstinence was confirmed for the 12-month period preceding data collection through hair analysis .
9493,METHODS,"Participants were also administered bespoke implicit and explicit cocaine user attitude measures , the self-esteem IAT and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale ."
9494,RESULTS,The category labels which elicited self-referenced knowledge showed low accuracy ( 19 % ) compared to the 65 % of the ` guilty/innocent ' labels proposed by original authors .
9495,RESULTS,The self-referenced aIAT version significantly correlated with the self-concept measures .
9496,RESULTS,The aIAT outcomes were independent from attitudes toward cocaine users .
9497,CONCLUSIONS,"Category labels play an influential role in determining the test 's accuracy , demonstrating that participants ' propositional knowledge and self-concept are involved during test performance ."
9498,CONCLUSIONS,The aIAT does not appear to tap directly into an individual 's implicit memory when relevant memory is not available .
9499,CONCLUSIONS,"Although the test can not be recommended for detecting drug use , further research should investigate underlying mechanisms and other potentials of the technique ."
9500,OBJECTIVE,To prospectively compare the achieved thickness and consistency of LASIK flaps created with a 60 - and 150-kHz femtosecond laser .
9501,METHODS,One hundred twenty eyes of 60 patients with myopia were treated with LASIK .
9502,METHODS,"One eye had flap created by the Intralase FS 60-kHz femtosecond laser ( Abbott Medical Optics , Abbott Park , IL ) and the fellow eye was treated with the IntraLase iFS 150-kHz femtosecond laser ( Abbott Medical Optics ) ."
9503,METHODS,Eyes were randomized according to ocular dominance .
9504,METHODS,Flap morphology and measurements were taken with anterior segment optical coherence tomography ( AS-OCT ) at the 1-month postoperative visit .
9505,RESULTS,AS-OCT showed similar regular planar morphologies in both groups .
9506,RESULTS,"The mean thickness of the flaps in the FS 60 group was significantly higher than that of the iFS 150 group ( 105.4 3.9 m vs 103.9 4.8 m , P = .009 ) ."
9507,RESULTS,The mean deviation from targeted flap thickness was not significantly different between the two groups .
9508,CONCLUSIONS,The Intralase iFS 150-kHz femtosecond laser creates flaps of similar thickness and uniformity to the Intralase FS 60-kHz femtosecond laser .
9509,OBJECTIVE,Periprosthetic bone cysts are a known finding after total ankle replacement ( TAR ) .
9510,OBJECTIVE,"The significance of cysts is uncertain , but they may threaten the long-term survival of the implant ."
9511,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of weight-bearing digital radiography compared with 3D weight-bearing multiplanar reconstructed ( MPR ) fluoroscopic imaging when diagnosing periprosthetic bone cysts in patients who have undergone TAR .
9512,METHODS,Forty-two consecutive patients with a Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement ( STAR ) were consecutively enrolled and underwent digital radiography and 3D MPR imaging in the same session .
9513,METHODS,"All 3D MPR images were interpreted in a blinded fashion , specifically with regard to the presence and extent of periprosthetic bone cysts ."
9514,METHODS,Cysts were measured in three planes whenever possible .
9515,METHODS,"Interrater and intrarater reliability was assessed by using Cohen kappa test , and comparisons between the two modalities were performed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank and McNemar tests ."
9516,RESULTS,"Significantly more cysts were detected on 3D MPR ( 74 vs 55 ) ( p = 0.03 ) , with the mean size of cysts detected by 3D MPR significantly larger than that of cysts diagnosed on digital radiography ( 1545 mm ( 3 ) vs 253 mm ( 3 ) ) ( p < 0.0001 ) ."
9517,RESULTS,Statistical analysis based on the presence or absence of cysts in individual patients did not show a significant difference between 3D MPR and digital radiography ( p = 0.23 ) .
9518,CONCLUSIONS,"The data imply that cysts are better detected and more accurately measured with 3D fluoroscopic MPR imaging compared with digital radiography , which underestimates not only the presence but also the extent of periprosthetic cysts ."
9519,OBJECTIVE,Oxidative stress and systemic inflammation are highly prevalent in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis ( MHD ) and are linked to excess cardiovascular risk .
9520,OBJECTIVE,This study examined whether short-term supplementation with pomegranate juice and extract is safe and well tolerated by MHD patients .
9521,OBJECTIVE,"The secondary aim was to assess the effect of pomegranate supplementation on oxidative stress , systemic inflammation , monocyte function , and blood pressure ."
9522,METHODS,"Prospective , randomized , crossover , pilot clinical trial ( NCT01562340 ) ."
9523,METHODS,The study was conducted from March to October 2012 in outpatient dialysis facilities in the Seattle metropolitan area .
9524,METHODS,"Twenty-four patients undergoing MHD ( men , 64 % ; mean age , 6114years ) were randomly assigned to receive pomegranate juice or extract during a 4-week intervention period ."
9525,METHODS,"After a washout period , all patients received the alternative treatment during a second 4-week intervention period ."
9526,METHODS,Patients assigned to receive pomegranate juice received 100mL of juice before each dialysis session .
9527,METHODS,"Patients assigned to receive pomegranate extract were given 1,050 mg of extract daily ."
9528,METHODS,The main outcome measures were safety and tolerability of pomegranate juice and extract .
9529,METHODS,"Additional secondary outcomes assessed included serum lipids , laboratory biomarkers of inflammation ( C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 ) and oxidative stress ( plasma F2 isoprostanes and isofurans ) , monocyte cytokine production , and predialysis blood pressure ."
9530,RESULTS,Both pomegranate juice and extract were safe and well tolerated by study participants .
9531,RESULTS,"Over the study period , neither treatment had a significant effect on lipid profiles , plasma C-reactive protein , interleukin 6 , F2-isoprostane or isofuran concentrations , predialysis systolic or diastolic blood pressure nor changed the levels of monocyte cytokine production ."
9532,CONCLUSIONS,Both pomegranate juice and extract are safe and well tolerated by patients undergoing MHD but do not influence markers of inflammation or oxidative stress nor affect predialysis blood pressure .
9533,BACKGROUND,Lipid-based nutrient supplements ( LNSs ) offer a vehicle to improve children 's diets in low-income countries where complementary foods are typically deficient in essential nutrients .
9534,BACKGROUND,Sustained acceptability by the intended users is essential for achieving growth-promoting effects .
9535,OBJECTIVE,We aimed to determine the sustained acceptability of LNSs among 6 - to 18-mo-old children in Malawi .
9536,METHODS,"In the context of a trial testing the growth-promoting effect of different formulations and doses of LNSs , we delivered LNSs to the homes of the children biweekly according to the randomization protocol ."
9537,METHODS,We defined acceptability to include adherence to feeding recommendations and mothers ' experiences of feeding LNSs to their child .
9538,METHODS,We conducted brief interviews each week with the mothers .
9539,METHODS,"At 2 time points we conducted knowledge , attitudes , and practices ( KAP ) interviews ."
9540,METHODS,"In addition , we conducted repeated in-depth interviews with a subset of mothers ."
9541,RESULTS,"Of the 1612 children who received the LNS intervention , we analyzed adherence data from 1478 ( 91.7 % ) children and KAP data at 2 time points ( child 's age of 12 and 18 mo ) from 839 ( 52.1 % ) of the children ."
9542,RESULTS,"The mean SD overall adherence ( proportion of days when the study child reportedly consumed LNSs considering only those weeks when the supplement had been successfully delivered to the home ) was 92.4 9.6 % , and there was no difference between children receiving milk-containing or milk-free LNSs ."
9543,RESULTS,There was also no increasing or decreasing trend over time in any of the groups .
9544,RESULTS,Sharing and deviation from other feeding recommendations were common .
9545,RESULTS,Maternal experiences were mostly very positive .
9546,CONCLUSIONS,The acceptability of LNS products was good and was sustained for 12 mo in this rural Malawian population .
9547,CONCLUSIONS,"However , sharing of the products with family members and deviation from other feeding recommendations were frequent , which means that individually targeted children were likely to receive less than the intended dose of the LNS ."
9548,CONCLUSIONS,This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00945698 .
9549,OBJECTIVE,"To compare the patients ' compliance with and the efficacy of existing treatments for Helicobacter pylori eradication , including moxifloxacin-based triple therapy , sequential treatment and the standard treatment ."
9550,METHODS,Patients with H.pylori infection were randomly assigned to three therapy groups .
9551,METHODS,"The triple therapy ( MML ) group was given moxifloxacin 400mg/day , metronidazole 500mg b.i.d. and lansoprazole 30mg b.i.d. for 10 days ."
9552,METHODS,"The sequential treatment ( AL-CML ) group was administrated amoxicillin 1g b.i.d. and lansoprazole 30mg b.i.d. for the first 5 days , followed by clarithromycin 500mg b.i.d. , metronidazole 500mg b.i.d. and lansoprazole 30mg b.i.d. for the second 5 days ."
9553,METHODS,"The standard treatment ( CAL ) group received amoxicillin 1g b.i.d. , clarithromycin 500mg b.i.d. and lansoprazole 30mg b.i.d. for 14 days ."
9554,METHODS,The eradication rates were evaluated by per-protocol ( PP ) analysis and intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis .
9555,RESULTS,"The eradication rates were 87.1 , 85.9 and 85.2 % by PP analysis and 87.1 , 84.9 and 84.2 % by ITT analysis in the MML , AL-CML and CAL group , respectively , and patients ' compliance rates were 98.2 , 96.5 and 97.1 % , respectively ."
9556,RESULTS,"There were no significant differences in treatment efficacy and compliance rates in the MML , AL-CML and CAL groups ( P > 0.05 ) ."
9557,CONCLUSIONS,"The present study revealed that standard triple therapy , sequential therapy and moxifloxacin-based triple therapy are all effective treatment regimens in terms of H.pylori eradication rates and compliance with therapy in Turkey ."
9558,BACKGROUND,Treatment of patients with drug-eluting stent ( DES ) in-stent restenosis ( ISR ) remains a major challenge .
9559,OBJECTIVE,This study evaluated the comparative efficacy of drug-eluting balloons ( DEB ) and everolimus-eluting stents ( EES ) in patients presenting with DES-ISR .
9560,METHODS,"The study design of this multicenter randomized clinical trial assumed superiority of EES for the primary endpoint , in-segment minimal lumen diameter at the 6 - to 9-month angiographic follow-up ."
9561,RESULTS,A total of 309 patients with DES-ISR from 23 Spanish university hospitals were randomly allocated to DEB ( n = 154 ) or EES ( n = 155 ) .
9562,RESULTS,"At late angiography ( median 247 days ; 90 % of eligible patients ) , patients in the EES arm had a significantly larger minimal lumen diameter ( 2.03 0.7 mm vs. 1.80 0.6 mm ; p < 0.01 ) ( absolute mean difference : 0.23 mm ; 95 % CI : 00.7 to 0.38 ) , net lumen gain ( 1.28 0.7 mm vs. 1.01 0.7 mm ; p < 0.01 ) , and lower percent diameter stenosis ( 23 22 % vs. 30 22 % ; p < 0.01 ) and binary restenosis rate ( 11 % vs. 19 % ; p = 0.06 ) , compared with patients in the DEB arm ."
9563,RESULTS,Consistent results were observed in the in-lesion analysis .
9564,RESULTS,"At the 1-year clinical follow-up ( 100 % of patients ) , the main clinical outcome measure ( composite of cardiac death , myocardial infarction , and target vessel revascularization ) was significantly reduced in the EES arm ( 10 % vs. 18 % ; p = 0.04 ; hazard ratio : 0.58 ; 95 % CI : 0.35 to 0.98 ) , mainly driven by a lower need for target vessel revascularization ( 8 % vs. 16 % ; p = 0.035 ) ."
9565,CONCLUSIONS,"In patients with DES-ISR , EES provided superior long-term clinical and angiographic results compared with DEB ."

9567,OBJECTIVE,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the order of complementary feeding in relation to breast-feeding affects breast milk , semisolid , or total energy intake in infants ."
9568,METHODS,The present study was designed as a randomized crossover trial .
9569,METHODS,The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital .
9570,METHODS,The study participants were 25 healthy infants between the ages of 7 and 11 months who were exclusively breast-fed for at least 6 months and were now receiving complementary foods for at least 1 month in addition to breast-feeding .
9571,METHODS,Infants were randomized to follow a sequence of either complementary feeding before breast-feeding ( sequence A ) or complementary feeding after breast-feeding ( sequence B ) for the first day ( 24 hours ) of the study period using simple randomization .
9572,METHODS,"For the next day , the sequence was reversed for each child ."
9573,METHODS,"All babies received 3 actively fed complementary food meals per day ( morning , afternoon , and evening ) ."
9574,METHODS,"A semisolid study diet was prepared in the hospital by cooking rice and pulse with oil using a standard method , ensuring the energy density of at least 0.6 kcal/g ."
9575,METHODS,The infants were allowed ad libitum breast-feeding during the observation period .
9576,METHODS,Semisolid intake was directly measured and breast milk intake was quantified by test weighing method .
9577,METHODS,Energy intake from complementary foods was calculated from the product of energy density of the diet served on that day and the total amount consumed .
9578,METHODS,The total energy intake and energy intake from breast milk and complementary foods between the 2 sequences were compared .
9579,RESULTS,"The mean ( standard deviation ) energy intake from breast milk during 12 hours of daytime by following sequence A ( complementary feeding before breast-feeding ) was 132.0 ( 67.4 ) kcal in comparison with 135.9 ( 56.2 ) kcal in sequence B , which was not statistically different ( P = 0.83 ) ."
9580,RESULTS,The mean ( standard deviation ) energy consumed from semisolids in sequences A and B was also comparable ( 88.6 [ 75.5 ] kcal vs. 85.5 [ 89.7 ] kcal ; P = 0.58 ) .
9581,RESULTS,"The total energy intake during daytime in sequence A was 220.6 ( 96.2 ) kcal in comparison with 221.5 ( 94.0 ) kcal in sequence B , which was also comparable ( P = 0.97 ) ."
9582,RESULTS,The results related to energy intake through breast milk and total energy intake were not different when insensible losses during feeding were adjusted in both groups .
9583,CONCLUSIONS,Altering the sequence of complementary feeding in relation to breast-feeding does not affect total energy intake .

9585,METHODS,Data of patients receiving tocilizumab or placebo in the MEASURE study were analysed .
9586,METHODS,"We investigated associations at baseline and during tocilizumab treatment among haemoglobin , parameters of haemoglobin and iron homeostasis [ ferritin , total iron-binding capacity ( TIBC ) , hepcidin , haptoglobin ] , IL-6 and acute-phase reactants [ C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) ] to identify statistical correlates of rise in haemoglobin level ."
9587,RESULTS,"At baseline , CRP and haptoglobin were inversely correlated ( modestly ) with haemoglobin levels ."
9588,RESULTS,"After treatment with tocilizumab , CRP , hepcidin , ferritin and haptoglobin levels fell alongside increases in TIBC and haemoglobin ."
9589,RESULTS,"The falls in CRP , hepcidin and haptoglobin levels in the first 2 weeks correlated with a week 12 rise in TIBC and haemoglobin ."
9590,CONCLUSIONS,Inflammatory anaemia improves in patients with RA treated with tocilizumab .
9591,CONCLUSIONS,"This improvement correlates with the degree of suppression of systemic inflammation , reduction in hepcidin and haptoglobin and increase in iron-binding capacity ."
9592,CONCLUSIONS,These clinical data provide evidence of a role for IL-6 signalling in the inflammatory anaemia of RA .
9593,BACKGROUND,"In randomized clinical studies , over 11,800 children , 12 months to 6 years of age , were administered ProQuad ( ) , a combination measles , mumps , rubella , and varicella vaccine ( MMRV ) ."
9594,BACKGROUND,This paper describes the safety following a 2-dose regimen of MMRV administered to children in the second year of life .

9614,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the effectiveness of a food safety map as an educational method with English language learners .
9615,METHODS,"English language learner community members ( n = 73 ) were assigned randomly to participate in 1 of 3 experimental conditions : food safety map , cooking class , and control ."
9616,METHODS,"Participants in the food safety map and cooking class conditions completed a pre-education demographic and cooking history questionnaire , a post-education knowledge and intention questionnaire , and a 2-week post-cooking and food safety habits assessment ."
9617,METHODS,Participants in the control group received no educational training but completed the pre - and 2-week post-education assessments .
9618,RESULTS,The cooking class and the map class were both effective in increasing food safety knowledge .
9619,RESULTS,"Specifically , by comparing with the control group , they significantly increased participants ' knowledge of safely cooking large meat ( [ df = 2 , n = 66 ] = 40.87 ; P < .001 ; V * = .79 ) and correctly refrigerating cooked food ( [ df = 2 , n = 73 ] = 24.87 , P < .001 ; V * = .58 ) ."
9620,RESULTS,The two class types generated similar positive educational effects on boosting food safety behavioral intention ( measured right after the class ) .
9621,RESULTS,The data collected 2 weeks after the classes suggested that individuals who took the classes followed the suggested food behaviors more closely than those in the control group ( P < .01 ) .
9622,CONCLUSIONS,"The food safety map is simple to use and prepare , beneficial for oral and visual learners , and inexpensive ."
9623,CONCLUSIONS,"Compared with a food safety cooking class , the map produces similar learning and behavioral outcomes ."
9624,OBJECTIVE,"Despite a general lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms , cold water immersion ( CWI ) is widely used by athletes for recovery ."
9625,OBJECTIVE,This study examined the physiological merit of CWI for recovery from high-intensity exercise by investigating if the placebo effect is responsible for any acute performance or psychological benefits .
9626,METHODS,"Thirty males ( mean SD : age , 24 5 yr ; VO2 peak , 51.1 7.0 mL kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ) performed an acute high-intensity interval training session , comprised of 4 30-s sprints , immediately followed by one of the following three 15-min recovery conditions : CWI ( 10.3 C 0.2 C ) , thermoneutral water immersion placebo ( TWP ) ( 34.7 C 0.1 C ) , or thermoneutral water immersion control ( TWI ) ( 34.7 C 0.1 C ) ."
9627,METHODS,An intramuscular thermistor was inserted during exercise and recovery to record muscle temperature .
9628,METHODS,"Swelling ( thigh girth ) , pain threshold/tolerance , interleukin 6 concentration , and total leukocyte , neutrophil , and lymphocyte counts were recorded at baseline , postexercise , postrecovery , and 1 , 24 , and 48 h postexercise ."
9629,METHODS,"A maximal voluntary isometric contraction ( MVC ) of the quadriceps was performed at the same time points , with the exception of postexercise ."
9630,METHODS,"Self-assessments of readiness for exercise , fatigue , vigor , sleepiness , pain , and belief of recovery effectiveness were also completed ."
9631,RESULTS,"Leg strength after the MVC and ratings of readiness for exercise , pain , and vigor were significantly impaired in TWI compared with those in CWI and TWP which were similar to each other ."
9632,CONCLUSIONS,A recovery placebo administered after an acute high-intensity interval training session is superior in the recovery of muscle strength over 48 h as compared with TWI and is as effective as CWI .
9633,CONCLUSIONS,"This can be attributed to improved ratings of readiness for exercise , pain , and vigor , suggesting that the commonly hypothesized physiological benefits surrounding CWI are at least partly placebo related ."
9634,OBJECTIVE,"To compare the clinical effectiveness of two implant systems : Way Milano and Kentron ( Geass , Pozzuolo del Friuli , UD , Italy ) ."
9635,METHODS,A total of 64 patients requiring at least two single crowns or partial fixed dental prostheses supported by a maximum of three implants had their sites randomised according to a split-mouth design to receive both implant systems at six centres .
9636,METHODS,Patients were followed up for 1 year after initial loading .
9637,METHODS,Outcome measures were : prosthesis/implant failures ; any complication ; peri-implant marginal bone level changes ; and clinician preference .
9638,RESULTS,In total 71 Way Milano and 73 Kentron implants were placed .
9639,RESULTS,"Six patients dropped-out before the 1-year follow-up , but all remaining patients were followed up to 1 year post-loading ."
9640,RESULTS,"No Way Milano implant failed , whereas three Kentron implants failed before loading ."
9641,RESULTS,"Two complications were reported , one for each implant type ."
9642,RESULTS,"There were no statistically significant differences for prosthesis/implant failures ( difference in proportions = 0.05 , P = 0.25 ; 95 % CI -0.02 to 0.13 ) and complications ( difference in proportions = 0 , P = 1.0 , 95 % CI -0.07 to 0.07 ) between the implant systems ."
9643,RESULTS,Three operators preferred Way Milano implants whereas the other three had no preference .
9644,RESULTS,At implant placement ( baseline ) bone levels were higher for Way Milano implants ( 0.27 mm ) than for Kentron implants ( 0.41 mm ) .
9645,RESULTS,Both groups gradually lost statistically significant amounts of periimplant marginal bone at 4 months after loading and at 1 year after loading .
9646,RESULTS,"One year after loading , Way Milano implants lost an average of 0.73 mm peri-implant bone compared with 0.84 mm of Kentron implants ."
9647,RESULTS,"Marginal bone level changes were not statistically significant different for Way Milano compared to Kentron implants at 4 months ( -0.16 mm , 95 % CI -0.30 , 0.01 ; P = 0.0606 ) and 1 year ( -0.09 mm , 95 % CI -0.26 , 0.09 ; P = 0.3407 ) after loading ."
9648,CONCLUSIONS,"No statistically significant differences were observed between the two implant types , although three Kentron implants failed versus none of the Way Milano type ."
9649,CONCLUSIONS,Longer follow-up of wider patient populations are needed to better understand whether there is an effective advantage with one of the two implant designs .

9691,BACKGROUND,"Due to fragmented mental , somatic , and social healthcare services , it can be hard to engage into care older patients with severe mental illness ( SMI ) ."
9692,BACKGROUND,"In adult mental health care , assertive community treatment ( ACT ) is an organizational model of care for treating patients with SMI who are difficult to engage ."
9693,BACKGROUND,So far all outcome studies of assertive community treatment have been conducted in adults .
9694,METHODS,In a randomized controlled trial design we compared the effectiveness of ACT for elderly patients with that of treatment as usual ( TAU ) .
9695,METHODS,Sixty-two outpatients ( 60 years and older ) with SMI who were difficult to engage in psychiatric treatment were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group ( 32 to ACT for elderly patients and 30 to TAU ) .
9696,METHODS,"Primary outcomes included number of patients who had a first treatment contact within 3 months , the number of dropouts ( i.e. those discharged from care due to refusing care or those who unintentionally lost contact with the service over a period of at least 3 months ) ; and patients ' psychosocial functioning ( HoNOS65 + scores ) during 18 months follow-up ."
9697,METHODS,Secondary outcomes included the number of unmet needs and mental health care use .
9698,METHODS,Analyses were based on intention-to-treat .
9699,RESULTS,"Of the 62 patients who were randomized , 26 were lost to follow-up ( 10 patients in ACT for elderly patients and 16 in TAU ) ."
9700,RESULTS,"Relative to patients with TAU , more patients allocated to ACT had a first contact within three months ( 96.9 versus 66.7 % ; X2 ( df = 1 ) = 9.68 , p = 0.002 ) ."
9701,RESULTS,"ACT for elderly patients also had fewer dropouts from treatment ( 18.8 % of assertive community treatment for elderly patients versus 50 % of TAU patients ; X2 ( df = 1 ) = 6.75 , p = 0.009 ) ."
9702,RESULTS,There were no differences in the other primary and secondary outcome variables .
9703,CONCLUSIONS,These findings suggest that ACT for elderly patients with SMI engaged patients in treatment more successfully .

9731,METHODS,A trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis based on a cluster-randomized controlled trial ( trial registration -- ISRCTN 19083628 ) comparing classroom-based CBT with usual school provision of Personal Social and Health Education .
9732,METHODS,Per-student cost of intervention was estimated from programme records .
9733,METHODS,"The study was undertaken in eight mixed-sex U.K. secondary schools , and included 3,357 school children aged 12 to 16 years ( in the two trial arms evaluated in the cost-effectiveness analysis ) ."
9734,METHODS,"The main outcome measures were individual self-reported data on care costs , Quality-Adjusted Life-Years ( QALYs , based on the EQ-5D health-related quality-of-life instrument ) and symptoms of depression ( Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire ) at baseline , 6 and 12 months ."
9735,RESULTS,"Although there was lower quality-adjusted life-years over 12 months ( -.05 QALYs per person , 95 % confidence interval -.09 to -.005 , p = .03 ) with CBT , this is a ` clinically ' negligible difference , which was not found in the complete case analyses ."

9745,RESULTS,"In addition , the rise in serum TnI concentration level from pre - to postoperative in the 80-mg ( 0.02 0.02 vs 0.09 0.08 ) and the 40-mg ( 0.01 0.03 vs 1.2 2.59 ) reloading groups was less than that of the controls ( 0.01 0.02 vs 1.75 3.09 ) ( p < 0.05 ) ."
9746,CONCLUSIONS,Our results suggested that high-dose atorvastatin application before PCI triggered early EPC circulation .
9747,CONCLUSIONS,"Furthermore , postoperative inflammatory cytokine sICAM-1 as well as hCRP serum levels were reduced , while postinterventional myocardial injury marker TnI elevations were inversely correlated with statin reloadings ."

9772,OBJECTIVE,"Given the limited sensitivity and specificity of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , its widespread use as a screening tool has raised concerns for the overdiagnosis of low-risk and the underdiagnosis of high-grade prostate cancer ."
9773,OBJECTIVE,"To improve early-detection biopsy decisions , the National Cancer Institute conducted a prospective validation trial to assess the diagnostic performance of the prostate cancer antigen 3 ( PCA3 ) urinary assay for the detection of prostate cancer among men screened with PSA ."
9774,METHODS,"In all , 859 men ( mean age , 62 years ) from 11 centers scheduled for a diagnostic prostate biopsy between December 2009 and June 2011 were enrolled ."
9775,METHODS,The primary outcomes were to assess whether PCA3 could improve the positive predictive value ( PPV ) for an initial biopsy ( at a score > 60 ) and the negative predictive value ( NPV ) for a repeat biopsy ( at a score < 20 ) .
9776,RESULTS,"For the detection of any cancer , PPV was 80 % ( 95 % CI , 72 % to 86 % ) in the initial biopsy group , and NPV was 88 % ( 95 % CI , 81 % to 93 % ) in the repeat biopsy group ."
9777,RESULTS,"The addition of PCA3 to individual risk estimation models ( which included age , race/ethnicity , prior biopsy , PSA , and digital rectal examination ) improved the stratification of cancer and of high-grade cancer ."
9778,CONCLUSIONS,These data independently support the role of PCA3 in reducing the burden of prostate biopsies among men undergoing a repeat prostate biopsy .
9779,CONCLUSIONS,"For biopsy-naive patients , a high PCA3 score ( > 60 ) significantly increases the probability that an initial prostate biopsy will identify cancer ."

9795,METHODS,"Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the drug , then at 20 and 40 minutes , and 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , and 24 hours after dosing , to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters of the single dose administration , ie , the area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ) from time zero to 24 hours ( AUCt ) , AUC from time zero to infinity ( AUC ( inf ) ) , the peak plasma concentration of the drug ( Cmax ) , time needed to achieve Cmax ( tmax ) , and the elimination half-life ( t1/2 ) ."
9796,METHODS,The plasma concentrations of gabapentin were determined using validated high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection .
9797,RESULTS,"The geometric mean ratios ( 90 % confidence interval ) of the test drug/reference drug for gabapentin were 103.15 % ( 90.38 % -117.72 % ) for AUCt , 103.53 % ( 90.78 % -118.07 % ) for AUC ( inf ) , and 108.06 % ( 96.32 % -121.24 % ) for Cmax ."
9798,RESULTS,The differences in tmax and t1/2 values between the test and reference drug products for gabapentin were not statistically significant .
9799,RESULTS,"Light-headedness , nausea , and headache were encountered during the study , but they were all mild and well tolerated ."
9800,RESULTS,The 90 % confidence intervals of the test/reference AUC ratio and Cmax ratio of gabapentin were within the acceptance range for bioequivalence .
9801,CONCLUSIONS,"The two preparations of gabapentin 300 mg capsule were bioequivalent , thus both can be used interchangeably in the clinical setting ."
9802,OBJECTIVE,We investigated the effects of 2-year folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation on cognitive performance in elderly people with elevated homocysteine ( Hcy ) levels .
9803,METHODS,"This multicenter , double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial included 2,919 elderly participants ( 65 years and older ) with Hcy levels between 12 and 50 mol/L ."
9804,METHODS,Participants received daily either a tablet with 400 g folic acid and 500 g vitamin B12 ( B-vitamin group ) or a placebo tablet .
9805,METHODS,Both tablets contained 15 g vitamin D3 .
9806,METHODS,"Data were available for global cognitive functioning assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination ( n = 2,556 ) , episodic memory ( n = 2,467 ) , attention and working memory ( n = 759 ) , information processing speed ( n = 731 ) , and executive function ( n = 721 ) ."
9807,RESULTS,Mean age was 74.1 ( SD 6.5 ) years .
9808,RESULTS,Hcy concentrations decreased 5.0 ( 95 % confidence interval -5.3 to -4.7 ) mol/L in the B-vitamin group and 1.3 ( -1.6 to -0.9 ) mol/L in the placebo group .
9809,RESULTS,"Cognitive domain scores did not differ over time between the 2 groups , as determined by analysis of covariance ."
9810,RESULTS,"Mini-Mental State Examination score decreased with 0.1 ( -0.2 to 0.0 ) in the B-vitamin group and 0.3 ( -0.4 to -0.2 ) in the placebo group ( p = 0.05 ) , as determined by an independent t test ."
9811,CONCLUSIONS,Two-year folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation did not beneficially affect performance on 4 cognitive domains in elderly people with elevated Hcy levels .
9812,CONCLUSIONS,"It may slightly slow the rate of decline of global cognition , but the reported small difference may be attributable to chance ."
9813,METHODS,This study provides Class I evidence that 2-year supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12 in hyperhomocysteinemic elderly people does not affect cognitive performance .
9814,BACKGROUND,"Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ( FF/VI ) is an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2-agonist ( ICS/LABA ) , recently approved as once-daily maintenance therapy for COPD ."
9815,BACKGROUND,We compared the lung function effects of FF/VI with those of twice-daily fluticasone propionate/salmeterol ( FP/SAL ) .
9816,METHODS,Three 12 week studies comparing FF/VI and FP/SAL were conducted .
9817,METHODS,"Patients aged 40 years with moderate-to-very severe COPD were randomized to receive double-blind , double-dummy FF/VI 100/25 mcg once-daily , or FP/SAL 250/50 mcg twice-daily for 12 weeks following a 2 week placebo run-in period ."
9818,METHODS,The primary endpoint of each study was change from baseline trough in 0-24 h weighted mean FEV ( 1 ) ( wmFEV ( 1 ) ) on Day 84 .
9819,METHODS,Safety was also assessed .
9820,RESULTS,"In Study 1 ( HZC113109 ) ( intent-to-treat n : FF/VI = 260 ; FP/SAL = 259 ) , the increase from baseline in 0-24 h wmFEV ( 1 ) was significantly greater with FF/VI than FP/SAL ( 80 mL , P < 0.001 ) ."
9821,RESULTS,"In Study 2 ( HZC112352 ) ( intent-to-treat n : FF/VI = 259 ; FP/SAL = 252 ) and Study 3 ( RLV116974 ) ( intent-to-treat n : FF/VI = 412 ; FP/SAL = 416 ) , the increase from baseline in 0-24 h wmFEV ( 1 ) was not significantly greater with FF/VI than FP/SAL ( 29 mL , P = 0.267 ; 25 mL , P = 0.137 ) ."
9822,RESULTS,"The treatment difference was statistically but not clinically significant in a pooled analysis ( 41 mL , P < 0.001 ) ."
9823,RESULTS,Pooled adverse events ( FF/VI 27 % ; FP/SAL 28 % ) and serious adverse events ( FF/VI 2 % ; FP/SAL 3 % ) were similar between treatments .
9824,CONCLUSIONS,"Our data suggest that once-daily FF/VI 100/25 mcg provides FEV ( 1 ) improvement in COPD that is at least comparable with that conferred by twice-daily FP/SAL 250/50 mcg , although interpretation is limited by differences in individual study outcomes ."
9825,CONCLUSIONS,The safety profiles of FF/VI 100/25 mcg and FP/SAL 250/50 mcg are similar .

9828,OBJECTIVE,Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is common in dialysis patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality .
9829,OBJECTIVE,The pathophysiology may be related to common risk factors for both AF and renal disease or to dialysis-specific factors .
9830,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this study was to determine whether and how AF onset relates to the dialysis procedure itself .
9831,METHODS,"All dialysis patients enrolled in the implantable cardioverter defibrillator-2 ( ICD-2 ) trial until January 2012 , who were implanted with an ICD , were included in this study ."
9832,METHODS,"Using the ICD remote monitoring function , the exact time of onset of all AF episodes was registered ."
9833,METHODS,"Subsequently , this was linked to the timing of dialysis procedures ."
9834,RESULTS,"For the current study , a total of 40 patients were included , follow-up was 28 16 months , 80 % male , 70 8 years old ."
9835,RESULTS,A total of 428 episodes of AF were monitored in 14 patients .
9836,RESULTS,AF onset was more frequent on the days of haemodialysis ( HD ) ( p < 0.001 ) and specifically increased during the dialysis procedure itself ( p = 0.04 ) .
9837,RESULTS,Patients with AF had a larger left atrium ( p < 0.001 ) and a higher systolic blood pressure before and after HD ( p < 0.001 ) .
9838,CONCLUSIONS,This study provides insight in the exact timing of AF onset in relation to the dialysis procedure itself .
9839,CONCLUSIONS,"In HD patients , AF occurred significantly more often on a dialysis day and especially during HD ."
9840,CONCLUSIONS,These findings might help to elucidate some aspects of the pathophysiology of AF in dialysis patients and could facilitate early detection of AF in these high-risk patients .
9841,OBJECTIVE,Low dose computerised tomography ( CT ) screening for lung cancer can reduce lung-cancer-specific mortality .
9842,OBJECTIVE,The objective of this study was to analyse healthcare costs and healthcare utilisation of participants in the Danish lung cancer CT-screening trial ( DLCST ) .
9843,METHODS,This registry study was nested in a randomised controlled trial ( DLCST ) .
9844,METHODS,"4104 participants , current or former heavy smokers , aged 50-70 years were randomised to five annual low dose CT scans or usual care during 2004-2010 ."
9845,METHODS,"Total healthcare costs and healthcare utilisation data for both the primary and the secondary healthcare sector were retrieved from public registries from randomisation - September 2011 and compared between ( 1 ) the CT-screening group and the control group and , ( 2 ) the control group and each of the true-positive , false-positive and true-negative groups ."
9846,RESULTS,"The median annual costs per participant were significantly higher in the CT-screening group ( Euros [ EUR ] 1342 , interquartile range [ IQR ] 750-2980 ) compared with the control group ( EUR 1190 , IQR 590-2692 ) ( p < 0.0001 ) ."
9847,RESULTS,"When the cost of the CT-screening programme was excluded , there was no longer a statistically significant difference between the CT-screening group ( EUR 1155 , IQR 567-2798 ) and the control group ( p = 0.52 ) ."
9848,RESULTS,Analyses according to the diagnostic groups showed that annual costs were 10.57 ( 95 % CI 7.09-15 .75 ) times higher for the true-positive and 1.67 ( 95 % CI 1.20-2 .32 ) times higher for the false-positive group compared with the control group .
9849,CONCLUSIONS,Low dose lung cancer CT screening increases healthcare costs compared with no screening ; this difference was attributable to the costs of the CT-screening programme .
9850,CONCLUSIONS,"Overall healthcare costs were higher for the true-positive and false-positive groups than for the control group , also when excluding the cost of the CT-screening programme ."
9851,CONCLUSIONS,This increase was outweighed by the larger true-negative group showing no significant differences in costs compared with the control group .
9852,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this study was to investigate whether individualized deliberate practice on a virtual reality ( VR ) simulator results in improved technical performance in the operating room .
9853,BACKGROUND,Training on VR simulators has been shown to improve technical performance in the operating room ( OR ) .
9854,BACKGROUND,Currently described VR curricula consist of trainees practicing the same tasks until expert proficiency is reached .
9855,BACKGROUND,"It has yet to be investigated whether the individualized deliberate practice , where curricula tasks vary depending on prior levels of technical proficiency , would translate into the OR ."
9856,METHODS,This single-blinded prospective trial randomized 16 novice surgical residents to a deliberate practice ( DP ) group and a conventional residency training group .
9857,METHODS,Both groups performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the OR that was video-recorded .
9858,METHODS,Technical performance of DP group residents in the OR was assessed using 3 validated assessment tools .
9859,METHODS,A score of less than 60 % on any component of the assessment tool resulted in the trainee practicing a specific task on the VR simulator .
9860,METHODS,The DP group practiced on the simulator as per their individualized schedule .
9861,METHODS,Both groups then performed another laparoscopic cholecystectomy .
9862,METHODS,A blinded expert assessed the OR recordings using a validated global rating scale .
9863,RESULTS,"Although both groups had similar technical abilities preintervention [ DP : median score , 13.5 ( 9.3-15 .0 ) ; control : median score , 14.5 ( 9.3-17 .8 ) ; P = 0.45 ] , the DP residents had a superior technical performance postintervention [ DP : median score , 17.0 ( 15.3-18 .5 ) ; control : median score , 12.5 ( 7.5-14 .0 ) ; P = 0.03 ] ."
9864,RESULTS,"Of 8 DP residents , 6 practiced 5 basic VR tasks ( median 1 trial to pass ) , and 7 of 8 practiced 2 advanced tasks ( median 4 trials to pass ) ."
9865,CONCLUSIONS,A curriculum of deliberate individualized practice on a VR simulator improves technical performance in the OR .
9866,CONCLUSIONS,"This has implications to greatly improve the feasibility of implementing simulation-based curricula in residency training programs , rather then having them being limited to research protocols ."

9881,OBJECTIVE,"However , there have been no clinical trials of its effect in patients with diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS-D ) ."
9882,OBJECTIVE,"We performed a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial to determine whether ramosetron reduces diarrhea in these patients ."
9883,METHODS,Our study included 296 male outpatients with IBS-D treated at 52 centers in Japan .
9884,METHODS,Patients were given 5 g oral ramosetron ( n = 147 ) or placebo ( n = 149 ) once daily for 12 weeks after a 1-week baseline period .
9885,METHODS,The primary end point was increased stool consistency in the first month .
9886,METHODS,Secondary end points included relief of overall IBS symptoms and increased IBS-related quality of life .
9887,RESULTS,"More patients given ramosetron ( 74 , 50.3 % ) than those given placebo ( 29 , 19.6 % ) reported improved stool consistency in the first month ( P < .001 ) ."
9888,RESULTS,"The relative risk and number needed to treat were 2.57 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.79-3 .70 ) and 3.25 ( 95 % confidence interval , 2.44-4 .89 ) , respectively ."
9889,RESULTS,The ramosetron group had significantly higher monthly rates of relief of overall IBS symptoms and IBS-related quality of life than the placebo group .
9890,CONCLUSIONS,"Ramosetron ( 5 g oral , once daily for 12 weeks ) improved stool consistency in male patients with IBS-D , compared with placebo ."
9891,CONCLUSIONS,"These study results , along with the pharmacologic profile of ramosetron , indicate that increased stool consistency is the best end point for studies of ramosetron in patients with IBS-D ."

9932,RESULTS,"Infants in the PFR group were discharged significantly earlier ( mean , 9.8 3.1 days vs 11.9 4.7 days ; P = .029 ) ."
9933,RESULTS,The need for intravenous fluids ( 2.8 % vs 33.3 % ; P = .0013 ) and the incidence of hypoglycemia ( 0 vs 33.3 % ; P = .00016 ) were significantly lower in the PFR group .
9934,RESULTS,Feeding intolerance and fecal calprotectin levels did not differ between the 2 groups .
9935,CONCLUSIONS,A PFR in moderately preterm SGA infants is well tolerated and significantly reduces both the length of stay and the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia .
9936,OBJECTIVE,"The study aimed to confirm the efficacy , through non-inferiority , of patient-driven versus investigator-driven titration of biphasic insulin aspart 30 ( BIAsp 30 ) in terms of glycemic control assessed by HbA1c change ."
9937,METHODS,"SimpleMix was a 20 week , open-label , randomized , two-armed , parallel-group , multicenter study in five countries ( Argentina , China , India , Poland , and the UK ) ."
9938,METHODS,Patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized into either patient-driven or investigator-driven BIAsp 30 titration groups .
9939,RESULTS,Non-inferiority of patient-driven vs. investigator-driven titration based on change in HbA1c from baseline to week 20 could not be demonstrated .
9940,RESULTS,Mean ( SE ) estimated change from baseline to week 20 was -0.72 ( 0.08 ) % in the patient-driven group and -0.97 ( 0.08 ) % in the investigator-driven group ; estimated difference 0.25 % ( 95 % CI : 0.04 ; 0.46 ) .
9941,RESULTS,Estimated mean change ( SE ) in fasting plasma glucose from baseline to week 20 was similar between groups : -0.94 ( 0.21 ) mmol/L for patient-driven and -1.07 ( 0.22 ) mmol/L for investigator-driven ( difference non-significant ) .
9942,RESULTS,"Both treatment arms were well tolerated , and hypoglycemic episode rates were similar between groups , with a rate ratio of 0.77 ( 95 % CI : 0.54 ; 1.09 ; p = 0.143 ) for all hypoglycemic episodes and 0.78 ( 95 % CI : 0.42 ; 1.43 ; p = 0.417 ) for nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes ."
9943,CONCLUSIONS,Non-inferiority of patient-driven versus investigator-driven titration with regard to change from baseline to end-of-treatment HbA1c could not be confirmed .
9944,CONCLUSIONS,It is possible that a clinic visit 12 weeks after intensification of treatment with BIAsp 30 in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately treated with basal insulin may benefit patient-driven titration of BIAsp 30 .
9945,CONCLUSIONS,"A limitation of the study was the relatively small number of patients recruited in each country , which does not allow country-specific analyses to be performed ."
9946,CONCLUSIONS,"Overall , treatment with BIAsp 30 was well tolerated in both treatment groups ."

9973,BACKGROUND,"In rural South Africa , only two-thirds of HIV-positive pregnant women seeking antenatal care at community health centers took full advantage of ` prevention of mother-to-child transmission ' ( PMTCT ) services in 2010 ."
9974,BACKGROUND,"Studies generally support male involvement to promote PMTCT , but the nature and impact of that involvement is unclear and untested ."
9975,BACKGROUND,"Additionally , stigma , disclosure and intimate partner violence pose significant barriers to PMTCT uptake and retention in care , suggesting that male involvement may be ` necessary , but not sufficient ' to reduce infant HIV incidence ."
9976,BACKGROUND,"This study expands on a successful United States President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) - supported PMTCT couples intervention pilot study conducted in the Mpumalanga province , targeting HIV-positive pregnant women and their partners , the primary objective being to determine whether male partner involvement plus a behavioral intervention will significantly reduce infant HIV incidence ."
9977,METHODS,"The study follows a cluster randomized controlled design enrolling two cohorts of HIV-positive pregnant women recruited from 12 randomly assigned Community Health Centers ( CHC ) ( six experimental , six control ) ."
9978,METHODS,"The two cohorts will consist of women attending without their male partners ( n = 720 ) and women attending with their male partners ( n = 720 couples ) , in order to determine whether the influence of male participation itself , or combined with a behavioral PMTCT intervention , can significantly reduce infant HIV infection ante - , peri - and postnatally ."
9979,CONCLUSIONS,"It is our intention to significantly increase PMTCT participation from current levels ( 69 % ) in the Mpumalanga province to between 90 and 95 % through engaging women and couples in a controlled , six session ante - and postnatal risk-reducing and PMTCT promotion intervention addressing barriers to PMTCT ( such as stigma , disclosure , intimate partner violence , communication , infant feeding practices and safer conception ) that prevent women and men from utilizing treatment opportunities available to them and their infants ."
9980,CONCLUSIONS,"Based upon the encouraging preliminary results from our pilot study , successful CHC adoption of the program could have major public health policy implications for containing the epidemic among the most vulnerable populations in rural South Africa : HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants ."

10147,BACKGROUND,"There is a need to identify innovative , low-cost and broad-reaching strategies for promoting exercise and improving physical function in older adults with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) ."
10148,METHODS,"This randomised controlled pilot trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month , DVD-delivered exercise intervention to improve functional performance and quality of life in older adults with MS. Participants will be randomised either into a DVD-delivered exercise condition or an attentional control condition ."
10149,METHODS,This novel approach to programme delivery provides participants with detailed exercise instructions which are presented in a progressive manner and includes a variety of modifications to better meet varying levels of physical abilities .
10150,METHODS,"The targeted exercises focus on three critical elements of functional fitness : flexibility , strength and balance ."
10151,METHODS,It is hypothesised that participants who are randomised to the exercise DVD condition will demonstrate improvements in physical function compared with participants assigned to the attentional control condition .
10152,METHODS,"Data analysis will include a 2 ( condition ) 2 ( time ) mixed factor analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) that follows intent-to-treat principles , as well as an examination of effect sizes ."
10153,METHODS,Participants will take part in qualitative interviews about perspectives on physical activity and programme participation .
10154,BACKGROUND,The study protocol was approved by a university institutional review board and registered with a federal database .
10155,BACKGROUND,Participants will be asked to read and sign a detailed informed consent document and will be required to provide a physician 's approval to participate in the study .

10159,BACKGROUND,Poverty undermines the adherence of patients to tuberculosis treatment .
10160,BACKGROUND,"A pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the extent to which economic support in the form of a voucher would improve patients ' adherence to treatment , and their treatment outcomes ."
10161,BACKGROUND,"Although the trial showed a modest improvement in the treatment success rates of the intervention group , this was not statistically significant , due in part to the low fidelity to the trial intervention ."
10162,BACKGROUND,"A qualitative process evaluation , conducted in the final few months of the trial , explained some of the factors that contributed to this low fidelity ."
10163,METHODS,"In-depth interviews were conducted with patients who received vouchers , nurses in intervention clinics , personnel in shops who administered the vouchers , and managers of the TB Control Programme ."
10164,METHODS,These interviews were analyzed thematically .
10165,RESULTS,The low fidelity to the trial intervention can be explained by two main factors .
10166,RESULTS,"The first was nurses ' tendency to ` ration ' the vouchers , only giving them to the most needy of eligible patients and leaving out those eligible patients whom they felt were financially more comfortable ."
10167,RESULTS,"The second was logistical issues related to the administration of the voucher as vouchers were not always available for patients on their appointed clinic dates , necessitating further visits to the clinics which they were not always able to make ."
10168,CONCLUSIONS,This process evaluation identifies some of the most important factors that contributed to the results of this pragmatic trial .
10169,CONCLUSIONS,It highlights the value of process evaluations as tools to explain the results of randomized trials and emphasizes the importance of implementers as ` street level bureaucrats ' who may profoundly affect the way an intervention is administered .

10182,BACKGROUND,"Short children born small for gestational age ( SGA ) are treated with a GH dose based on body size , but treatment may lead to high levels of IGF1 ."
10183,BACKGROUND,The objective was to evaluate IGF1 titration of GH dose in contrast to current dosing strategies .
10184,METHODS,"In the North European Small-for-Gestational-Age Study ( NESGAS ) , 92 short pre-pubertal children born SGA were randomised after 1 year of high-dose GH treatment ( 67g/kg per day ) to three different regimens : high dose ( 67g/kg per day ) , low dose ( 35g/kg per day ) or IGF1 titration ."
10185,RESULTS,"The average dose during the second year of the randomised trial did not differ between the IGF1 titration group ( 38g/kg per day , s.d. 0.019 ) and the low-dose group ( 35g/kg per day , s.d. 0.002 ; P = 0.46 ) , but there was a wide variation in the IGF1 titration group ( range 10-80g / kg per day ) ."
10186,RESULTS,"The IGF1 titration group had significantly lower height gain ( 0.17 SDS , s.d. 0.18 ) during the second year of the randomised trial compared with the high-dose group ( 0.46 SDS , s.d. 0.25 ) , but not significantly lower than the low-dose group ( 0.23 SDS , s.d. 0.15 ; P = 0.17 ) ."
10187,RESULTS,"The IGF1 titration group had lower IGF1 levels after 2 years of the trial ( mean 1.16 , s.d. 1.24 ) compared with both the low-dose ( mean 1.76 , s.d. 1.48 ) and the high-dose ( mean 2.97 , s.d. 1.63 ) groups ."
10188,CONCLUSIONS,IGF1 titration of GH dose in SGA children proved less effective than current dosing strategies .
10189,CONCLUSIONS,"IGF1 titration resulted in physiological IGF1 levels with a wide range of GH dose and a poorer growth response , which indicates the role of IGF1 resistance and highlights the heterogeneity of short SGA children ."
10190,OBJECTIVE,"To quantify the effect of food on the systemic exposure of lapatinib at steady state when administered 1 h before and after meals , and to observe the safety and tolerability of lapatinib under these conditions in patients with advanced solid tumours ."
10191,METHODS,"This was a three-treatment , randomised , three-sequence cross-over study ."
10192,METHODS,Lapatinib was administered 1 h after a low - [ B ] or a high-fat [ C ] meal and systemic exposure was compared with that obtained following administration 1 h before a low-fat meal [ A ] .
10193,RESULTS,"In total , 25 patients were included , of whom 12 were evaluable for the pharmacokinetic analysis ."
10194,RESULTS,Both low-fat and high-fat meals affected lapatinib exposure .
10195,RESULTS,Lapatinib AUC0-24 increased following lapatinib administration 1 h after a low-fat meal by 1.80-fold ( 90 % CI : 1.37-2 .37 ) and after a high-fat meal by 2.61-fold ( 90 % CI : 1.98-3 .43 ) .
10196,RESULTS,Lapatinib Cmax increased following lapatinib administration 1 h after a low-fat meal by 1.90-fold ( 90 % CI : 1.49-2 .43 ) and after a high-fat meal by 2.66-fold ( 90 % CI : 2.08-3 .41 ) .
10197,RESULTS,"The most commonly occurring treatment-related toxicity was diarrhoea ( 8/25 , 32 % CTCAE grade 1 and 2/25 , 8 % grade 2 ) and one treatment-related grade3 event occurred ( fatigue grade 3 , 4 % ) ."
10198,CONCLUSIONS,Both low-fat and high-fat food consumed 1 h before lapatinib administration increased lapatinib systemic exposure compared with lapatinib administration 1 h before a low-fat meal .
10199,CONCLUSIONS,"In order to administer lapatinib in a fasted state , it is advised to administer the drug 1 h before a meal ."
10200,OBJECTIVE,"Inserting a nasogastric tube ( NGT ) in intubated patients may be difficult because they can not follow swallowing instructions , resulting in a high rate of first-attempt failure ."
10201,OBJECTIVE,We introduce a simple technique for inserting an orogastric tube in an emergency department ( ED ) .
10202,METHODS,"Fifty-six patients in the ED , who were intubated and required NGT insertion , were randomly allocated to 2 groups ."
10203,METHODS,We inserted the NGT using a conventional technique from the nostril ( control group ) and an endotracheal tube ( ET ) - assisted technique from the mouth ( ET group ) .
10204,METHODS,"The procedures ' success rate , insertion duration , and complications were compared between the groups ."
10205,RESULTS,"There was a significantly higher overall success rate in the ET group than the control group ( 100 % vs 64 % , P < .001 ) ."
10206,RESULTS,"Endotracheal tube group showed 100 % first-attempt success rate , but 50 % of the control group failed at first attempt ."
10207,RESULTS,"Mean duration of the first trial was not significantly different between the ET and control groups ( 58.016.9 vs 57.329.5 seconds , P = .903 ) , but total time for successful insertion was longer in the control group than the ET group ( 58.016.9 vs 111.774.5 seconds , P < .001 ) ."
10208,RESULTS,"There was less NGT kinking and more mucosal bleeding in the ET group than in the control group ( 0 % vs 16 % , P = .019 ; 16 % vs 7 % , P = .225 , respectively ) ."
10209,CONCLUSIONS,Endotracheal tube-assisted orogastric tube insertion technique showed a higher rate of successful insertion and shorter total duration .

10211,OBJECTIVE,Intramuscular botulinum toxin-A ( BoNT-A ) injections reduce spasticity by blocking neurotransmission at the motor endplate ( MEP ) .
10212,OBJECTIVE,The goal of this study was to assess the reduction in spasticity achieved by injecting BoNT-A at different sites of the gracilis muscle .
10213,METHODS,"Thirty-four gracilis muscles , in 27 children ( 10 females and 17 males , mean age of 8.6 y [ SD 2.5 y ] ) with spastic cerebral palsy ( unilateral and bilateral , Gross Motor Function Classification System [ GMFCS ] levels I-IV ) , were randomly assigned to one of two groups ."
10214,METHODS,In one group BoNT-A was injected proximally ( at a site 25 % of the distance from the pubic tubercle and the medial epicondyle ) and in the other it was injected at the MEP zones ( half of the dose was administered at 30 % of this distance and half at 60 % ) .
10215,METHODS,Spasticity was assessed before and after BoNT-A injection using simultaneous measurements of surface electromyography ( sEMG ) and angular velocity during passive muscle stretch applied at different velocities .
10216,METHODS,The primary outcome measure included the velocity-dependent change in average root mean square electromyography ( RMS-EMG ) .
10217,METHODS,Secondary outcome was assessed with the Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) and Modified Tardieu Scale ( MTS ) .
10218,RESULTS,"Spasticity decreased more in MEP-targeted muscles than in proximally injected muscles , as demonstrated by a larger reduction in average RMS-EMG values ( p = 0.04 ) , though this difference was not found with the MAS or MTS ."
10219,CONCLUSIONS,The results suggest that BoNT-A injection of the gracilis at sites with a high concentration of MEPs is effective at reducing spasticity .
10220,CONCLUSIONS,These preliminary findings should be confirmed by larger studies .
10221,CONCLUSIONS,"In the case of long muscles , such as the gracilis , the injection site is important ."
10222,BACKGROUND,"More than 50 % of patients with advanced breast cancer develop bone metastases that may lead to multiple complications such as pathological fractures , bone pain or hypercalcaemia ."
10223,BACKGROUND,"The standard treatment , besides endocrine , targeted-therapy or chemotherapy , is the use of bisphosphonates ."
10224,BACKGROUND,"However , one of their main adverse side-effects is bisphosphonate-induced nephrotoxicity ."
10225,BACKGROUND,"The mechanism by which the latter occurs is not well-understood , although emerging evidence suggests that the effect of bisphosphonates on the kidney may differ between agents ."
10226,METHODS,The aim of this evaluation was to compare the renal toxicity of 6 mg ibandronate i.v. versus 4 mg zoledronic acid i.v. over a period of six months in women with breast cancer and bone metastases .
10227,METHODS,"A prospective randomized trial was carried out to examine specific kidney and other parameters ( 1 - and 2-microglobulin , albumin , 2-macroglobulin , IgG and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) generated from spontaneous urine samples from 17 patients of each group ."
10228,RESULTS,We were unable to find any significant difference between the two treatment groups with regard to renal toxicity .
10229,RESULTS,"All patients , independently of the applied bisphosphonate , experienced only temporary renal dysfunction without any evidence of irreversible damage in terms of acute nephrotoxicity during the study period ."
10230,RESULTS,"1-Microglobulin , a marker for proximal tubular damage , in particular , was not differently elevated in either group ."
10231,CONCLUSIONS,Both applied bisphosphonates were found to be well-tolerated and safe with regard to renal toxicity during a six-month treatment period in patients with otherwise healthy kidneys having advanced breast cancer and bone metastases .

10245,RESULTS,"Considering BMI values , HOMA was 11.00 ( range 6.53-12 .56 ) , 5.64 ( range 3.54-7 .95 ) , and 4.54 ( range 3.21-5 .43 ) , and insulin was 34.53 6.84 , 22.76 8.91 , and 19.47 6.01 U/ml in obese , overweight , and normal-weight WBS patients , respectively ."
10246,RESULTS,"Comparing the results with the two control groups , WBS patients showed higher insulin values than healthy controls ( p < 0.001 ) , but similar values as the BMI-matched control group ( p = n.s. ) ."
10247,RESULTS,"However , WBS patients showed significantly higher values of glycemia ( healthy control group , p < 0.001 ; BMI-matched control group , p < 0.05 ) and HOMA ( healthy control group , p < 0.001 ; BMI-matched control group , p < 0.05 ) than the two control groups ."
10248,RESULTS,"Finally , among WBS patients there was a higher number of subjects with IGT and T2DM than among healthy controls ( p < 0.0001 ) and the BMI-matched control group ( p = 0.0002 ) ."
10249,CONCLUSIONS,"Our data strongly suggest that IGT and T2DM may be frequently discovered in children , adolescents , and young adults with WBS ."
10250,CONCLUSIONS,WBS should be included among the genetic syndromes associated with T2DM .

10286,BACKGROUND,Pregnant women are the highest priority group for annual influenza vaccination .
10287,BACKGROUND,Studies have shown unacceptably low uptake of both seasonal and pandemic A/H1N1 influenza vaccination among pregnant women .
10288,BACKGROUND,This paper will describe the study protocol and methodology of a randomised controlled trial designed to assess the effectiveness of a brief educational intervention in improving the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine among pregnant women in Hong Kong .
10289,METHODS,A randomised controlled trial will be conducted with pregnant women in at least the second trimester of pregnancy from four publicly funded hospital antenatal clinics in Hong Kong .
10290,METHODS,Participants will be randomly assigned to either one of the two treatment groups : standard care ( control ) or standard care plus brief education ( intervention ) .
10291,METHODS,Pregnant women in the standard care group will receive the usual antenatal care with an educational pamphlet developed by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection and those in the intervention group will be provided with usual care plus a brief ten-minute education intervention .
10292,METHODS,Content of the education session will cover four core components recommended in the research literature .
10293,METHODS,The primary study outcome will be the proportion of participants who have received influenza vaccine during their pregnancy .
10294,METHODS,A total of 184 pregnant women ( 92 per group ) will be required to give an 80 % power to detect a treatment effect of 15 % .
10295,CONCLUSIONS,Most intervention studies aimed at improving influenza vaccination rates in pregnant women have targeted obstetric-care providers and the results of the two patient-oriented RCT interventions are conflicting .
10296,CONCLUSIONS,The high priority for vaccination given to pregnant women and the low influenza vaccination rate among pregnant women worldwide strongly indicates a need for interventions to improve uptake .

10431,BACKGROUND,Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in the presence of cervical spine instability may put patients at risk of cervical cord injury .
10432,BACKGROUND,"Nevertheless , the biomechanics of intubation ( cervical spine motion as a function of applied force ) have not been characterized ."
10433,BACKGROUND,This study characterized and compared the relationship between laryngoscope force and cervical spine motion using two laryngoscopes hypothesized to differ in force .
10434,METHODS,"Fourteen adults undergoing elective surgery were intubated twice ( Macintosh , Airtraq ) ."
10435,METHODS,"During each intubation , laryngoscope force , cervical spine motion , and glottic view were recorded ."

10437,RESULTS,"Maximal force and motion occurred at stage 3 and differed between the Macintosh and Airtraq : ( 1 ) force : 48.8 15.8 versus 10.4 2.8 N , respectively , P = 0.0001 ; ( 2 ) occiput-C5 extension : 29.5 8.5 versus 19.1 8.7 degrees , respectively , P = 0.0023 ."
10438,RESULTS,"Between stages 2 and 3 , the motion/force ratio differed between Macintosh and Airtraq : 0.5 0.2 versus 2.0 1.4 degrees/N , respectively ; P = 0.0006 ."
10439,CONCLUSIONS,The relationship between laryngoscope force and cervical spine motion is : ( 1 ) nonlinear and ( 2 ) differs between laryngoscopes .
10440,CONCLUSIONS,"Differences between laryngoscopes in motion/force relationships are likely due to : ( 1 ) laryngoscope-specific cervical extension needed for intubation , ( 2 ) laryngoscope-specific airway displacement/deformation needed for intubation , and ( 3 ) cervical spine and airway tissue viscoelastic properties ."
10441,CONCLUSIONS,Cervical spine motion during endotracheal intubation is not directly proportional to force .
10442,CONCLUSIONS,Low-force laryngoscopes can not be assumed to result in proportionally low cervical spine motion .

10467,OBJECTIVE,"That being presumed , this study asks the following questions : ( 1 ) Is there a difference in muscular strength when an individual holds a substance that is inimical to life processes ( a poison solution ) , as compared to a substance that is essential for life ( normal saline ) ?"
10468,OBJECTIVE,( 2 ) Is this effect a transaction involving input from both the person being measured and the kinesiologist doing the measurement or is it only the person being measured ?
10469,OBJECTIVE,"( 3 ) As an extension of question 2 , is the result the same when different kinesiologists take the measurement or when no kinesiologist is involved ?"
10470,OBJECTIVE,"( 4 ) Does belief , expectation , gender , or time cognition play a role in determining response ?"
10471,METHODS,"To answer these questions , which would help to define the parameters of the AK process , 51 participants were tested during three trials each , first by one kinesiologist , then by another , and finally , with no kinesiologist present by grip strength indicated using a hand dynamometer ."
10472,METHODS,Grip strength being a self-administered AK test of relative muscular strength .
10473,METHODS,"For each trial , a pair of randomly numbered sealed vials , each pair in a randomly numbered plastic bag , were used as the objects of the trial ."
10474,METHODS,"In each bag , one vial contained saline solution while the other was filled with a slightly smaller amount of saline solution to which had been added ionic hydroxylamine hydrochloride ( NH3OH ) ( + ) , producing a toxic solution of 9mg/ml ."
10475,METHODS,Each trial consisted of a separate muscle test for each vial .
10476,METHODS,All present at the trials were blind as to which vial contained the toxin .
10477,METHODS,And all who prepared the vials were blind to the trials .
10478,METHODS,The force used by the kinesiologists in each of their trials was measured via a pressure pad system .
10479,METHODS,The hand dynamometer trials were conducted with no kinesiologist present .
10480,RESULTS,"Of the 151 sets of trials , the toxic vial was identified correctly in 80 of them ( 53 % ) , resulting in a one-tailed exact binomial P-value of .258 ."
10481,RESULTS,Results for two of the kinesiologists were almost exactly at chance .
10482,RESULTS,"For the third kinesiologist , there was a one-tailed exact binomial P-value of .18 ( unadjusted for multiple testing ) ."
10483,RESULTS,Results for the dynamometer were also almost exactly at chance .
10484,RESULTS,Testing whether there was a significant difference in proportions for whom the AK test worked based on belief about whether it would work resulted in non-significant ( 2 ) values of 0.6 ( P = .439 ) for the trials with one kinesiologist and 2.222 ( P = .136 ) for the hand dynamometer trials .
10485,RESULTS,The final variable examined was gender .
10486,RESULTS,"While there was no significant difference in performance for males and females for the trials of the male kinesiologist or the hand dynamometer , the combined data for the two female kinesiologists did reveal a difference ."
10487,RESULTS,"Of the 33 sessions with females , only 15 were successful ( 45 % ) , while for the 18 sessions with males , 14 were successful ( 78 % ) , resulting in a ( 2 ) statistic of 4.96 , P = .026 ."
10488,RESULTS,"However , given all of the ( 2 ) tests performed in this section , the results must be interpreted with caution because of multiple testing ."
10489,RESULTS,Results indicate belief in whether the AK test will work was not significantly related to whether it actually did work .
10490,RESULTS,A ( 2 ) test of the relationship between time perception and correct vial choice showed no significant relationships .
10491,RESULTS,"The ( 2 ) statistic for the relationship using the hand dynamometer data was 0.927 , P = .629 ."
10492,CONCLUSIONS,"The data in this study , particularly when seen in the larger context of a review of the literature from the AK field itself by Klinkoski and Leboeuf ( 1990 ) , which considered 50 papers published between 1981 and 1987 by the International College of Applied Kinesiology , and the survey by Hall , Lewith , Brien , and Little ( 2008 ) , using standard evaluation criteria [ quality assessment tool for studies of diagnostic accuracy included in systematic reviews ( QUADAS ) , Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Studies ( STARD ) , JADAD , and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) ] , for research methodology , as well as six prior non-clinical studies by Radin ( 1984 ) , Quintanar and Hill ( 1988 ) , Braud ( 1989 ) , Arnett et al. ( 1999 ) , Ludtke ( 2001 ) , and Kendler and Keating ( 2003 ) , all together suggest the following : The research published by the Applied Kinesiology field itself is not to be relied upon , and in the experimental studies that do meet accepted standards of science , Applied Kinesiology has not demonstrated that it is a useful or reliable diagnostic tool upon which health decisions can be based ."
10493,OBJECTIVE,The phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor tadalafil is approved for the treatment of signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) .
10494,OBJECTIVE,"While tadalafil significantly improves overall lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of BPH ( LUTS/BPH ) , improvements in nocturia were not significant in individual studies ."
10495,OBJECTIVE,We therefore sought to further assess nocturia based on data integrated from four tadalafil registrational studies .
10496,METHODS,"Data were integrated from four randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , 12-week registrational studies of tadalafil for LUTS/BPH ."
10497,METHODS,Nocturia was assessed as nighttime voiding frequency using the International Prostate Symptom Score question 7 ( IPSS Q7 ) .
10498,METHODS,Efficacy results were analyzed using analysis of covariance .
10499,RESULTS,"For the tadalafil 5 mg once daily ( N = 752 ) and placebo ( N = 748 ) groups , baseline characteristics were well balanced , and the overall severity of nocturia per mean IPSS Q7 was 2.3 1.2 ."
10500,RESULTS,"The mean treatment change was -0.4 with placebo and -0.5 with tadalafil ; the least-squares mean ( standard error ) treatment difference was -0.2 ( 0.05 ) , p = 0.002 ."
10501,RESULTS,"For patients receiving placebo and tadalafil , respectively , the proportion with improved nocturnal frequency was 41.3 and 47.5 % , with no change was 44.8 and 41.0 % , and with worsening was 13.9 and 11.5 % ."
10502,CONCLUSIONS,"A statistically significant improvement in nocturnal frequency was seen with tadalafil over placebo ; however , the treatment difference was small and not considered clinically meaningful ."
10503,CONCLUSIONS,Further studies using voiding diaries and excluding patients with nocturnal polyuria would be needed to more precisely estimate the impact of tadalafil on nocturia associated with LUTS/BPH .
10504,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate whether 6.6-mm long implants could be a suitable alternative to longer implants placed in vertically augmented atrophic posterior mandibles .
10505,METHODS,Sixty partially edentulous patients having 7 to 8 mm of residual crestal height and at least 5.5 mm thickness measured on CT scans above the mandibular canal were randomised according to a parallel group design .
10506,METHODS,They were either to receive 1 to 3 submerged 6.6-mm long implants or 9.6 mm or longer implants ( 30 patients per group ) placed in vertically augmented bone .
10507,METHODS,Bone was augmented with interpositional anorganic bovine bone blocks covered by resorbable barriers .
10508,METHODS,Grafts were left to heal for 5 months before implant placement .
10509,METHODS,"Four months after provisional acrylic prostheses were delivered , they were replaced , after 4 months , by definitive metal-ceramic prostheses ."
10510,METHODS,Outcome measures were : prosthesis and implant failures ; complications ; and radiographic peri-implant marginal bone level changes .
10511,METHODS,All patients were followed up to 5 years after loading .
10512,RESULTS,"Five years after loading , 8 patients dropped out : 3 from the short implant group and 5 from the augmented group ."
10513,RESULTS,The augmentation procedure failed in 2 patients and only 6.6-mm long implants could be inserted .
10514,RESULTS,There were no statistically significant differences for prosthesis and implant failures .
10515,RESULTS,Five prostheses failed in 4 patients of the short implant group versus 5 prostheses in 5 patients in the augmented group ( Fishers exact test P = 1.0 ; difference in proportions = 0.07 ; 95 % CI -0.29 to 0.43 ) .
10516,RESULTS,Five short implants failed in 3 patients versus 3 long implants in 3 patients ( Fishers exact test P = 1.00 difference in proportions = 0.00 ; 95 % CI -0.43 to 0.43 ) .
10517,RESULTS,"There were statistically more complications in augmented patients ( 25 complications in 21 augmented patients versus 6 complications in 6 patients of the short implant group ) ( Fishers exact test P < 0.0001 ; difference in proportions = 0.60 ; 95 % CI 0.38 , 0.82 ) ."
10518,RESULTS,Both groups gradually lost peri-implant bone in a statistically significant way .
10519,RESULTS,"Five years after loading , short implant group patients lost an average of 1.49 mm peri-implant bone compared with 2.34 mm in the augmented group ."
10520,RESULTS,"Short implants experienced statistically significantly less bone loss ( 0.82 mm , 95 % CI 0.48 ; 1.16 , P < 0.0001 ) than long implants ."
10521,CONCLUSIONS,"When residual bone height over the mandibular canal is between 7 to 8 mm , 6.6 mm short implants could be an interesting alternative to vertical augmentation in posterior atrophic mandibles since the treatment is faster , cheaper and associated with less morbidity ."
10522,CONCLUSIONS,"Longer follow-ups may still be needed to confirm these results , however the medium-term prognosis ( 5 years after loading ) of short implants is at least as good as those of longer implants placed vertically in augmented mandibles ."
10523,BACKGROUND,Pilonidal sinus disease is associated with significant morbidity after surgical treatment with regard to wound healing .
10524,BACKGROUND,Recent case studies suggested that negative-pressure wound therapy as primary treatment following surgical excision may shorten the duration of wound healing .
10525,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the role of vacuum therapy in pilonidal sinus disease : negative-pressure wound therapy versus standard open wound care after surgical excision .
10526,METHODS,Patients were randomly assigned to either negative-pressure wound therapy for 2 weeks or standard open wound healing .
10527,METHODS,The primary end point of the study was the time to complete wound healing .
10528,METHODS,"Secondary end points were visual analog scale score , wound size ratio at day 14 ( ie , wound healing rate ) , time to resume daily activities , and recurrence within 6 months after wound closure ."
10529,RESULTS,"Forty-nine patients were included in the study : 24 patients were treated with vacuum therapy , and 25 patients underwent standard open wound care ."
10530,RESULTS,Complete wound healing was achieved at a median of 84 days in the vacuum therapy group versus 93 days in control patients ( p = 0.44 ) .
10531,RESULTS,"The wound size ratio was significantly lower in the vacuum therapy group ( 0.30 versus 0.57 , p = 0.02 ) , ie , higher wound healing rate in the first 2 weeks ."
10532,RESULTS,There was no difference in visual analog scale scores and disease recurrence between both groups .
10533,RESULTS,The time to resume full daily activities after surgery was 27 days in the patients undergoing vacuum therapy and 29 days in the control patients ( p = 0.92 ) .
10534,CONCLUSIONS,"This study is limited by the small number of patients , the lack of blinding to patients and doctors , and the absence of patient quality-of-life evaluation ."
10535,CONCLUSIONS,"It is feasible to apply vacuum therapy in the treatment of pilonidal sinus disease , and it has a positive effect on wound size reduction in the first 2 weeks ."
10536,CONCLUSIONS,"However , there is no difference in time to complete wound healing and time to resume daily life activities ."
10537,BACKGROUND,Plasmodium falciparum malaria is treated with 25 mg/kg of chloroquine ( CQ ) irrespective of age .
10538,BACKGROUND,"Theoretically , CQ should be dosed according to body surface area ( BSA ) ."
10539,BACKGROUND,The effect of dosing CQ according to BSA has not been determined but doubling the dose per kg doubled the efficacy of CQ in children aged < 15 years infected with P. falciparum carrying CQ resistance causing genes typical for Africa .
10540,BACKGROUND,The study aim was to determine the effect of age on CQ concentrations .
10541,RESULTS,"Day 7 whole blood CQ concentrations were determined in 150 and 302 children treated with 25 and 50 mg/kg , respectively , in previously conducted clinical trials ."
10542,RESULTS,CQ concentrations normalised for the dose taken in mg/kg of CQ decreased with decreasing age ( p < 0.001 ) .
10543,RESULTS,CQ concentrations normalised for dose taken in mg/m ( 2 ) were unaffected by age .
10544,RESULTS,"The median CQ concentration in children aged < 2 years taking 50 mg/kg and in children aged 10-14 years taking 25 mg/kg were 825 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 662-988 ) and 758 ( 95 % CI 640-876 ) nmol/l , respectively ( p = 0.67 ) ."
10545,RESULTS,The median CQ concentration in children aged 10-14 taking 50 mg/kg and children aged 0-2 taking 25 mg/kg were 1521 and 549 nmol/l .
10546,RESULTS,Adverse events were not age/concentration dependent .
10547,CONCLUSIONS,CQ is under-dosed in children and should ideally be dosed according to BSA .
10548,CONCLUSIONS,Children aged < 2 years need approximately double the dose per kg to attain CQ concentrations found in children aged 10-14 years .
10549,CONCLUSIONS,Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of CQ in Africa are typically performed in children aged < 5 years .
10550,CONCLUSIONS,Thus the efficacy of CQ is typically assessed in children in whom CQ is under dosed .
10551,CONCLUSIONS,Approximately 3 fold higher drug concentrations can probably be safely given to the youngest children .
10552,CONCLUSIONS,As CQ resistance is concentration dependent an alternative dosing of CQ may overcome resistance in Africa .
10553,OBJECTIVE,To compare the safety and efficacy of fibrin glue and cyanoacrylate glue for refixating the recessed muscle to the sclera in patients undergoing strabismus surgery .
10554,METHODS,"In this prospective , randomized , and interventional case series , there were 15 patients in each group ."
10555,METHODS,Two different types of glue were used for refixating the muscle to the sclera after its recession : fibrin glue ( fibrin group ) and cyanoacrylate glue ( cyanoacrylate group ) .
10556,METHODS,Resection was performed as usual with a 6-0 polyglactin suture .
10557,METHODS,The conjunctiva was closed with the same glue that was used for muscle recession .
10558,RESULTS,Average time required per muscle attachment was 1.480.694 minutes in the fibrin group and 2.420.584 minutes in the cyanoacrylate group .
10559,RESULTS,There was no significant difference in pain at all postoperative visits in both groups .
10560,RESULTS,Significantly more chemosis was observed in the cyanoacrylate group at postoperative 3 weeks .
10561,RESULTS,"At all other postoperative visits , there was no significant difference in chemosis in both groups ."
10562,RESULTS,There was significantly more conjunctival reaction in the cyanoacrylate group at 1 and 3 weeks and 3 months ; the difference was highly significant at 3 months ( P = .00 ) .
10563,RESULTS,"Total inflammatory score was significantly high in the cyanoacrylate group at 1 week , 3 weeks , and 3 months ."
10564,CONCLUSIONS,"Both fibrin and cyanoacrylate glue are equally efficacious for muscle reattachment ; however , fibrin glue is more biotolerant compared to cyanoacrylate glue and results in less postoperative inflammation , and is thus recommended for recession in strabismus surgery ."
10565,BACKGROUND,"Stratification of patients for treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) is suboptimal , with high systemic overtreatment rates ."
10566,METHODS,"A training set of 95 tumours from women with pure DCIS were immunostained for proteins involved in cell survival , hypoxia , growth factor and hormone signalling ."
10567,METHODS,A generalised linear regression with regularisation and variable selection was applied to a multiple covariate Cox survival analysis with recurrence-free survival 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out iterative approach were used to build and test the model that was validated using an independent cohort of 58 patients with pure DCIS .
10568,METHODS,The clinical role of a COX-2-targeting agent was then tested in a proof-of-concept neoadjuvant randomised trial in ER-positive DCIS treated with exemestane 25 mg day ( -1 ) celecoxib 800 mg day ( -1 ) .
10569,RESULTS,The COX-2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for early relapse in the training ( HR 37.47 ( 95 % CI : 5.56-252 .74 ) P = 0.0001 ) and independent validation cohort ( HR 3.9 ( 95 % CI : 1.8-8 .3 ) P = 0.002 ) .
10570,RESULTS,There was no significant interaction with other clinicopathological variables .
10571,RESULTS,A statistically significant reduction of Ki-67 expression after treatment with exemestane celecoxib was observed ( P < 0.02 ) with greater reduction in the combination arm ( P < 0.004 ) .
10572,RESULTS,Concomitant reduction in COX-2 expression was statistically significant in the exemestane and celecoxib arm ( P < 0.03 ) only .
10573,CONCLUSIONS,"In patients with DCIS , COX-2 may predict recurrence , aiding clinical decision making ."
10574,CONCLUSIONS,A combination of an aromatase inhibitor and celecoxib has significant biological effect and may be integrated into treatment of COX2-positive DCIS at high risk of recurrence .
10575,OBJECTIVE,The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus casei Shirota on the values of mutans streptococci counts in saliva .
10576,METHODS,31 children were included in this double blinded study .
10577,METHODS,"Study design included 4 periods which consisted of a run in period , two intervention periods and a washout period ."
10578,METHODS,During the intervention periods children were either given probiotic milk or control milk for 10 days .
10579,METHODS,Pre and post intervention salivary samples were subjected to microbiological evaluation .
10580,METHODS,Then numbers of mutans streptococci were taken by identifying colony morphology .
10581,RESULTS,A statistically significant reduction of mutans streptococci colony count was noted in the probiotic group ( p = .003 ) .
10582,RESULTS,The reduction in children with higher levels of mutans streptococci ( 105 ) after intervention was 34 % in the probiotic group .
10583,CONCLUSIONS,Daily consumption of milk containing probiotic bacteria can reduce the levels of mutans streptococci and may contribute to the prevention of dental caries .
10584,OBJECTIVE,This study introduces a new device to facilitate perforation size measurement during `` butterfly '' myringoplasty .
10585,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of ` otological compass ' on short-term results of inlay cartilaginous ` butterfly ' tympanoplasty technique in adult patients .
10586,METHODS,"Prospective , randomized , controlled , blinded ."
10587,METHODS,This study included 25 patients who underwent inlay cartilage myringoplasty .
10588,METHODS,All operations were performed under general anesthesia by the same surgeon with a microscope-assisted approach .
10589,METHODS,The patients were divided randomly and consecutively into two groups : Group 1 ( n = 12 ) had perforation dimensions and shape measured using the Otologic Compass ( OC ) and the control group ( n = 13 ) had perforation measured by means of a Fisch elevator .
10590,METHODS,"The duration of surgery , number of trials for correct placement of the cartilage graft , results and complications of the surgery were evaluated and compared ."
10591,RESULTS,The mean follow-up duration was 6 months .
10592,RESULTS,Groups were similar in terms of age and perforation diameters ( p > 0.05 ) .
10593,RESULTS,"Average number of cartilage shaping before satisfactory graft fitting was significantly fewer in the OC group : 1.1 0.3 and 2.2 0.6 trials for OC and control groups , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) ."
10594,RESULTS,Mean duration of preparation and satisfactory graft fitting was 9.6 4.2 minutes in the OC group whereas it was 18.1 5.2 minutes for the control group .
10595,RESULTS,Operative duration was significantly shorter in the OC group ( p < 0.001 ) .
10596,RESULTS,"At the end of the follow-up period , successful closure occurred 91.7 % and 84.6 % patients in the OC and control groups , respectively ( p > 0.05 ) ."
10597,RESULTS,"The mean preoperative to postoperative three-tone air-bone gap improved 7.9 dB and 9.0 dB in OC and control groups , respectively ( p > 0.05 ) ."
10598,CONCLUSIONS,This study shows that OC presents as a useful tool that expedites and refines butterfly myringoplasty procedure .
10599,CONCLUSIONS,The number of cartilage shaping prior to satisfactory graft fitting revealed significantly better results : almost all surgeries in the OC group were complete after a single cartilage shaping attempt .
10600,BACKGROUND,Attrition is common in alcohol clinical trials and the resultant loss of data represents an important methodological problem .
10601,BACKGROUND,"In the absence of a simulation study , the drinking outcomes among those who are lost to follow-up are not known ."
10602,BACKGROUND,"Individuals who drop out of treatment and continue to provide drinking data , however , may be a reasonable proxy group for making inferences about the drinking outcomes of those lost to follow-up ."
10603,METHODS,"We used data from the COMBINE study , a multisite , randomized clinical trial , to examine drinking during the 4months of treatment among individuals who dropped out of treatment but continued to provide drinking data ( i.e. , `` treatment dropouts ; '' n = 185 ) ."
10604,METHODS,"First , we estimated the observed treatment effect size for naltrexone versus placebo in a sample that included both treatment completers ( n = 961 ) and treatment dropouts ( n = 185 ; total N = 1,146 ) , as well as the observed treatment effect size among just those who dropped out of treatment ( n = 185 ) ."
10605,METHODS,"In both the total sample ( N = 1,146 ) and the dropout sample ( n = 185 ) , we then deleted the drinking data after treatment dropout from those 185 individuals to simulate missing data ."
10606,METHODS,"Using the deleted data sets , we then estimated the effect of naltrexone on the continuous outcome percent heavy drinking days using 6 methods to handle missing data ( last observation carried forward , baseline observation carried forward , placebo mean imputation , missing = heavy drinking days , multiple imputation ( MI ) , and full information maximum likelihood [ FIML ] ) ."
10607,RESULTS,"MI and FIML produced effect size estimates that were most similar to the true effects observed in the full data set in all analyses , while missing = heavy drinking days performed the worst ."
10608,CONCLUSIONS,"Although missing drinking data should be avoided whenever possible , MI and FIML yield the best estimates of the treatment effect for a continuous outcome measure of heavy drinking when there is dropout in an alcohol clinical trial ."
10609,BACKGROUND,There is evidence that neurofibrillary tangle ( NFT ) burden is associated with psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer disease ( AD ) .
10610,BACKGROUND,"However , it is not clear whether this association is direct or mediated through the increased cognitive impairment associated with NFTs ."
10611,METHODS,We sought to determine whether the extended MAPT haplotype was associated with the worsening of delusions and hallucinations in a combined cohort of 95 patients who participated in 2 clinical trials of treatment with memantine .
10612,RESULTS,"After controlling for baseline dementia severity , exposure to memantine , and antipsychotics , analysis shows that carriers of at least one H2 allele had a 5.4-fold ( P = .03 ) increased risk of worsening hallucinations ."
10613,RESULTS,There was some evidence of association with worsening delusions but only in analysis by allele .
10614,CONCLUSIONS,These results are the first to indicate that the H2 allele of the extended MAPT haplotype negatively affects the course of psychotic symptoms in AD independently of disease severity .
10615,CONCLUSIONS,It will be important for future research to examine MAPT transcription in people with AD with and without psychotic symptoms to understand the exact mechanisms underlying these findings .
10616,BACKGROUND,We introduced an initial large dose of modified St. Thomas ' Hospital cardioplegic solution with the aim of providing both myocardial protection as well as a smooth intraoperative process .
10617,METHODS,"In 90 cases of isolated aortic valve replacement , we used the modified technique of cardioplegia in 45 ( group S ) and conventional administration of glucose-insulin-potassium solution in 45 ( group G ) ."
10618,METHODS,The patients were selected at random .
10619,METHODS,"In group S , we added 4 mEq of potassium to the original St. Thomas ' Hospital solution and administered 30mLkg ( -1 ) as an initial dose ."
10620,METHODS,The temperature was decreased to 2 .
10621,RESULTS,The mean of reperfusion time after declamping in group S was significantly shorter ( 16.7 6.4 vs. 21.5 10.0 min ; p = 0.007 ) .
10622,RESULTS,The average of postoperative maximum creatine kinase-MB was significantly lower in group S ( 25.6 9.5 vs. 40.6 37.2 IUL ( -1 ) ; p = 0.014 ) .
10623,RESULTS,"On multivariate analysis , use of the modified cardioplegia and aortic crossclamp time were significantly associated with creatine kinase-MB level and reperfusion time after declamping ."
10624,CONCLUSIONS,This modified technique was an acceptable option that provided a bloodless operative field and avoided multiple cardioplegic administrations .
10625,BACKGROUND,"Vitamin D and its metabolites have potent immunomodulatory effects in vitro , including up-regulation of cathelicidin , a critical antimicrobial protein ."
10626,OBJECTIVE,"We investigated whether administration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ( calcitriol ) to critically ill patients with sepsis would have beneficial effects on markers of innate immunity , inflammation , and kidney injury ."
10627,METHODS,"We performed a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , physiologic study among 67 critically ill patients with severe sepsis or septic shock ."
10628,METHODS,Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of calcitriol ( 2 g intravenously ) versus placebo .
10629,METHODS,The primary outcome was plasma cathelicidin protein levels assessed 24 hours after study drug administration .
10630,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes included leukocyte cathelicidin mRNA expression , plasma cytokine levels ( IL-10 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor - , IL-1 , and IL-2 ) , and urinary kidney injury markers ."
10631,RESULTS,Patients randomized to calcitriol ( n = 36 ) versus placebo ( n = 31 ) had similar plasma cathelicidin protein levels at 24 hours ( P = 0.16 ) .
10632,RESULTS,Calcitriol-treated patients had higher cathelicidin ( P = 0.04 ) and IL-10 ( P = 0.03 ) mRNA expression than placebo-treated patients 24 hours after study drug administration .
10633,RESULTS,"Plasma cytokine levels ( IL-10 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor - , IL-1 , and IL-2 ) and urinary kidney injury markers were similar in calcitriol - versus placebo-treated patients ( P > 0.05 for all comparisons ) ."
10634,RESULTS,Calcitriol had no effect on clinical outcomes nor were any adverse effects observed .
10635,CONCLUSIONS,Calcitriol administration did not increase plasma cathelicidin protein levels in critically ill patients with sepsis and had mixed effects on other immunomodulatory markers .
10636,CONCLUSIONS,Additional phase II trials investigating the dose and timing of calcitriol as a therapeutic agent in specific sepsis phenotypes may be warranted .
10637,CONCLUSIONS,Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT 01689441 ) .
10638,OBJECTIVE,We report active treatment group differences on response and remission rates and changes in anxiety severity at weeks 24 and 36 for the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study ( CAMS ) .
10639,METHODS,"CAMS youth ( N = 488 ; 74 % 12 years of age ) with DSM-IV separation , generalized , or social anxiety disorder were randomized to 12 weeks of cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , sertraline ( SRT ) , CBT+SRT ( COMB ) , or medication management/pill placebo ( PBO ) ."
10640,METHODS,Responders attended 6 monthly booster sessions in their assigned treatment arm ; youth in COMB and SRT continued on their medication throughout this period .
10641,METHODS,"Efficacy of COMB , SRT , and CBT ( n = 412 ) was assessed at 24 and 36 weeks postrandomization ."
10642,METHODS,Youth randomized to PBO ( n = 76 ) were offered active CAMS treatment if nonresponsive at week 12 or over follow-up and were not included here .
10643,METHODS,"Independent evaluators blind to study condition assessed anxiety severity , functioning , and treatment response ."
10644,METHODS,Concomitant treatments were allowed but monitored over follow-up .
10645,RESULTS,The majority ( > 80 % ) of acute responders maintained positive response at both weeks 24 and 36 .
10646,RESULTS,"Consistent with acute outcomes , COMB maintained advantage over CBT and SRT , which did not differ , on dimensional outcomes ; the 3 treatments did not differ on most categorical outcomes over follow-up ."
10647,RESULTS,"Compared to COMB and CBT , youth in SRT obtained more concomitant psychosocial treatments , whereas those in SRT and CBT obtained more concomitant combined ( medication plus psychosocial ) treatment ."
10648,CONCLUSIONS,"COMB maintained advantage over CBT and SRT on some measures over follow-up , whereas the 2 monotherapies remained indistinguishable ."
10649,CONCLUSIONS,"The observed convergence of COMB and monotherapy may be related to greater use of concomitant treatment during follow-up among youth receiving the monotherapies , although other explanations are possible ."
10650,CONCLUSIONS,"Although outcomes were variable , most CAMS-treated youth experienced sustained treatment benefit ."

10664,BACKGROUND,The incidence of chronic pain is higher among immigrants in Europe than among the native European population .
10665,BACKGROUND,Therapeutic interventions in this population are far less effective than in patients for whom these programmes were originally developed .
10666,OBJECTIVE,"In a randomised trial , we investigated whether a cognitive behavioural treatment ( CBT ) programme supplemented with culturally sensitive aspects ( CsCBT ) improves pain intensity , pain disability and quality of life among immigrant patients , compared with a treatment of culturally sensitive exercise therapy ( CsET ) alone ."
10667,OBJECTIVE,"Furthermore , we investigated whether healthcare costs would decrease ."
10668,METHODS,First-generation Turkish immigrants residing in Switzerland ( 20-65 years of age ) who suffered from chronic pain were enrolled in the trial .
10669,METHODS,Patients were randomised to attend either CsCBT or CsET .
10670,METHODS,The CsCBT intervention was based upon a manualised cognitive-behavioural group treatment programme for chronic pain patients and adapted to the needs of a Turkish immigrant population .
10671,METHODS,The CsET intervention was based on principles of exercise therapy for treatment of nonspecific low back pain .
10672,RESULTS,A total of 116 outpatients were recruited between October 2004 and November 2006 .
10673,RESULTS,The intervention was completed by 89 patients ( 77 % ) .
10674,RESULTS,"A total of 78 subjects ( 67 % ) completed follow-up , 12 months after the completion of the intervention programme ."
10675,RESULTS,"The intervention showed no effects in reducing pain , pain disability or quality of life ."
10676,RESULTS,The analysis of healthcare utilisation yielded no intervention effect .

10678,OBJECTIVE,"The objectives of this randomized , single-blinded , placebo-controlled pilot trial were to investigate the effects of varenicline on opioid withdrawal among chronic pain patients undergoing opioid detoxification in an interdisciplinary pain program and the feasibility of varenicline use in this population ."
10679,METHODS,"Twenty-one patients were recruited ( varenicline = 10 , placebo = 11 ) , and 7 patients in the varenicline and 11 in the placebo group completed the study ."
10680,METHODS,"Opioid withdrawal was quantified using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale , and varenicline-related adverse effects were assessed ."
10681,RESULTS,Opioid withdrawal scores tended to decrease over the course of opioid tapering in those receiving varenicline and increase in those receiving placebo .
10682,RESULTS,"Varenicline was well-tolerated in this population , with no adverse drug effects ( including nausea ) observed and no effect on improvements in pain severity and depression ."
10683,CONCLUSIONS,This randomized pilot study provides preliminary data for future trials of varenicline in opioid-dependent adults with chronic pain undergoing medically directed opioid detoxification .
10684,BACKGROUND,"Natural ultraviolet exposure induces hair damage , which is difficult to avoid ."
10685,BACKGROUND,"Most of the research work is focused on the effect of ultraviolet on the epidermis , dermis as well as the immune system , whereas the long-term effect of ultraviolet on hair has not been investigated ."
10686,OBJECTIVE,we performed our experiment to find out the changes induced in hair follicle and shaft in those patients exposed to high doses of ultraviolet ( A and B ) during treatment of other skin conditions .
10687,METHODS,Light and transmission electron microscopy examination of scalp hair follicles and shafts of 10 patients with vitiligo under psoralen plus ultraviolet A ( group 1 ) and 10 patients with vitiligo under narrow band ultraviolet B ( group 2 ) was carried out and compared with those of 10 healthy volunteers ( group 3 ) .
10688,RESULTS,Physical changes in the appearance of hair were more in groups 1 and 2 than control .
10689,RESULTS,Reduced hair follicle thickness and perifollicular infiltrate and hyaline disorganized perifollicular collagen were observed more in group 1 than in group 2 with the absence of these changes in group 3 .
10690,RESULTS,"Transmission electron microscopy showed nonspecific cell injury in hair follicles in group 1 more than the other 2 groups , while the damaging effect on hair was more in the second group than the others ."
10691,CONCLUSIONS,"Due to the damaging effect of ultraviolet on hair , patients under treatment with this modality should be cautious to protect their hair during treatment ."
10692,BACKGROUND,"Kawasaki disease , the most common cause of acquired heart disease in developed countries , is a self-limited vasculitis that is treated with high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin ."
10693,BACKGROUND,Resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin in Kawasaki disease increases the risk of coronary artery aneurysms .

10699,METHODS,"Patients , treating physicians and staff , study team members , and echocardiographers were all masked to treament assignment ."
10700,METHODS,The primary outcome was the difference between the groups in treatment resistance defined as a temperature of 380C or higher at 36 h to 7 days after completion of the infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin .
10701,METHODS,Analysis was by intention to treat .
10702,METHODS,"This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT00760435 ."
10703,RESULTS,196 patients were enrolled and randomised : 98 to the infliximab group and 98 to placebo .
10704,RESULTS,One patient in the placebo group was withdrawn from the study because of hypotension before receiving treatment .
10705,RESULTS,Treatment resistance rate did not differ significantly ( 11 [ 112 % ] for infliximab and 11 [ 113 % ] for placebo ; p = 081 ) .
10706,RESULTS,"Compared with the placebo group , participants given infliximab had fewer days of fever ( median 1 day for infliximab vs 2 days for placebo ; p < 00001 ) ."
10707,RESULTS,"At week 2 , infliximab-treated patients had greater mean reductions in erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( p = 0009 ) and a two-fold greater decrease in Z score of the left anterior descending artery ( p = 0045 ) than did those in the placebo group , but this difference was not significant at week 5 ."
10708,RESULTS,"Participants in the infliximab group had a greater mean reduction in C-reactive protein concentration ( p = 00003 ) and in absolute neutrophil count ( p = 0024 ) at 24 h after treatment than did those given placebo , but by week 2 this difference was not significant ."
10709,RESULTS,"At week 5 , none of the laboratory values differed significantly compared with baseline ."
10710,RESULTS,"No significant differences were recorded between the two groups at any timepoint in proximal right coronary artery Z scores , age-adjusted haemoglobin values , duration of hospital stay , or any other laboratory markers of inflammation measured ."

10716,OBJECTIVE,To analyze changes in refraction and associated biometric changes in atropine - and placebo-treated eyes in the Atropine for Treatment of Myopia study ( ATOM1 ) .
10717,METHODS,"A total of 400 myopic children , aged 6 to 12 years , were assigned randomly to receive 1 % atropine or a placebo agent in one eye daily for 2 years , after which drops were stopped and children monitored for another year ."
10718,METHODS,"Cycloplegic autorefraction , A-scan biometry , and automated keratometry were performed at the initial visit , 2 weeks ( baseline ) , and at 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 30 , and 36 months ."
10719,RESULTS,A total of 313 children ( 78.3 % ) completed the study .
10720,RESULTS,"In placebo-treated eyes , there was myopic progression of -1.55 diopters ( D ) , between baseline and 36 months , associated with reductions in corneal curvature ( K ; -0.13 D ) and anterior chamber depth ( ACD ; -0.17 mm ) and increases in lens thickness ( LT ; 0.05 mm ) , vitreous chamber depth ( VCD ; 0.65 mm ) , and axial length ( AL ; 0.53 mm ) ."
10721,RESULTS,"Multivariate analysis of change in spherical equivalent demonstrated that the hyperopic shift ( 0.20 D ) noted in atropine-treated eyes between baseline and 4 months , and the myopic rebound ( -0.74 D ) noted between 24 to 30 months when atropine was stopped , were associated with a reduction and increase in VCD and AL , respectively , after adjusting for age and sex ."
10722,RESULTS,"Changes in K , ACD , and LT were less relevant ."
10723,RESULTS,"Between 4 and 24 months , atropine-treated eyes demonstrated gradual myopic progression ( -0.40 D ) , accompanied by reduction in K ( -0.06 D ) and ACD ( -0.07 mm ) and increase in VCD ( 0.13 mm ) and AL ( 0.06 mm ) ."
10724,CONCLUSIONS,"Atropine appeared to slow myopia progression mainly by reducing or slowing the growth in VCD , and thereby AL. ( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00371124 . )"
10725,BACKGROUND,"Sutezolid ( PNU-100480 ) is a linezolid analog with superior bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the hollow fiber , whole blood and mouse models ."

10727,BACKGROUND,This study of sutezolid is its first in tuberculosis patients .
10728,METHODS,"Sputum smear positive tuberculosis patients were randomly assigned to sutezolid 600 mg BID ( N = 25 ) or 1200 mg QD ( N = 25 ) , or standard 4-drug therapy ( N = 9 ) for the first 14 days of treatment ."
10729,METHODS,Effects on mycobacterial burden in sputum ( early bactericidal activity or EBA ) were monitored as colony counts on agar and time to positivity in automated liquid culture .
10730,METHODS,Bactericidal activity was also measured in ex vivo whole blood cultures ( whole blood bactericidal activity or WBA ) inoculated with M. tuberculosis H37Rv .
10731,RESULTS,All patients completed assigned treatments and began subsequent standard TB treatment according to protocol .
10732,RESULTS,"The 90 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for bactericidal activity in sputum over the 14 day interval excluded zero for all treatments and both monitoring methods , as did those for cumulative WBA ."
10733,RESULTS,"There were no treatment-related serious adverse events , premature discontinuations , or dose reductions due to laboratory abnormalities ."
10734,RESULTS,There was no effect on the QT interval .
10735,RESULTS,"Seven sutezolid-treated patients ( 14 % ) had transient , asymptomatic ALT elevations to 17334 U/L on day 14 that subsequently normalized promptly ; none met Hy 's criteria for serious liver injury ."
10736,CONCLUSIONS,The mycobactericidal activity of sutezolid 600 mg BID or 1200 mg QD was readily detected in sputum and blood .
10737,CONCLUSIONS,Both schedules were generally safe and well tolerated .
10738,CONCLUSIONS,Further studies of sutezolid in tuberculosis treatment are warranted .

10742,METHODS,CT datasets of 78 patients treated with swIMRT and 79 patients treated with RA were included .
10743,METHODS,"To compare the resulting dose distributions , the dose-volume parameters were evaluated for the planning target volumes ( PTVs ) , clinical target volumes ( CTVs ) , and organs at risk ( OARs ) , and the number of MU were calculated ."
10744,METHODS,Acute toxicity was assessed by the Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 .
10745,RESULTS,PTV coverage with the 95 % isodose was slightly better for RA .
10746,RESULTS,Dose distribution has proven to be significantly more homogenous with RA and led to a reduction of 62 % in MU with better OAR sparing .
10747,RESULTS,"As for toxicity , more grade 3 mucositis and dysphagia was observed for swIMRT , though we observed more grade 3 dermatitis for RA ."
10748,CONCLUSIONS,"In our retrospective analysis , RA had better target coverage and better sparing of the OAR ."

10752,METHODS,This is a prospective randomized clinical trial comprising 11 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation .
10753,METHODS,Before and after EMS the thigh and leg circumference in both lower limbs and the goniometry of the tibiotarsal joint were measured .
10754,METHODS,"The angle of 90 on the goniometer was taken as the standard neutral position ( NP ) , with the arm fixed on the lateral malleolus of the ankle joint ."
10755,METHODS,"Other measurements , namely dorsiflexion and plantar flexion , referred to as mobile arm , were taken from the NP ."
10756,METHODS,These recordings were obtained following an active contraction of the patients ' muscles .
10757,RESULTS,"Compared with the electrostimulated limb , a difference in dorsiflexion of the control limb was observed ( 96.224.9 versus 119.914.1 ; p = 0.01 ) ."
10758,RESULTS,A girth of 10cm of the leg was found in limb reduction when compared to the electrostimulated one ( 24.73.1 versus 26.44.0 cm ; p = 0.03 ) .
10759,CONCLUSIONS,EMS used at low current intensity and for a short duration failed to prevent muscle atrophy in critically ill patients .

10761,BACKGROUND,"Despite numerous benefits of live donor kidney transplant ( LDKT ) , patient-level barriers often prevent African Americans from considering LDKT ."
10762,BACKGROUND,Educational interventions designed to address patient-level barriers may increase willingness among African American patients with end-stage renal disease to explore LDKT as a treatment option .
10763,OBJECTIVE,To assess the effectiveness of a culturally sensitive educational intervention called Living ACTS ( About Choices in Transplantation and Sharing ) that was designed to address patient-level barriers to LDKT among African American patients with end-stage renal disease .
10764,METHODS,Patients were randomized to intervention ( n = 136 ) or control ( n = 132 ) groups .
10765,METHODS,They completed baseline measures and then viewed either the Living ACTS or control video .
10766,METHODS,Both groups then completed an immediate follow-up measure and a 6-month assessment administered via telephone .
10767,METHODS,"Self-reported knowledge about LDKT , willingness to talk to the patient 's family about LDKT , and perceived benefits of LDKT were measured at 3 time points ."
10768,RESULTS,"At 6-month follow-up , intervention participants demonstrated a significantly greater increase in knowledge of LDKT than control participants ( F2 ,229 = 3.08 , P = .05 ) ."
10769,RESULTS,"Intervention participants expressed greater willingness to talk to patients ' families about LDKT than did control participants from baseline through 6-month follow-up ( F1 ,230 = 7.11 , P = .008 ) ."
10770,RESULTS,"Finally , at immediate follow-up , intervention participants reported greater endorsement of the benefits of LDKT than did control participants ( F2 ,223 = 14.27 , P < .001 ) ; however , this effect had disappeared by the 6-month follow-up ."
10771,CONCLUSIONS,Living ACTS is effective at increasing and maintaining knowledge about LDKT among African American patients with end-stage renal disease who are considering transplant .

10773,BACKGROUND,"As pharmacy resources become increasingly limited , the impact of informational videos on the counseling process becomes more relevant ."
10774,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate differences in pharmacist time spent counseling and patient comprehension ( measured by the Oral Anticoagulation Knowledge [ OAK ] test ) between informational videos and traditional face-to-face ( oral ) counseling .
10775,METHODS,"This prospective , open , parallel-group study at an academic medical center randomized 40 individuals-17 warfarin-nave ( `` New Start '' ) and 23 with prior warfarin use ( `` Restart '' ) - to receive warfarin discharge education by video or face-to-face counseling ."
10776,METHODS,`` Teach-back '' questions were used in both groups .
10777,RESULTS,"Although overall pharmacist time was reduced in the video counseling group ( P < 0.001 ) , an interaction between prior warfarin use and counseling method ( P = 0.012 ) suggests the difference between counseling methods was smaller in New Start participants ."
10778,RESULTS,"Following adjustment , mean total time was reduced 8.71 ( 95 % CI = 5.15-12 .26 ) minutes ( adjusted P < 0.001 ) in Restart participants and 2.31 ( -2.19 to 6.81 ) minutes ( adjusted P = 0.472 ) in New Start participants receiving video counseling ."
10779,RESULTS,Postcounseling OAK test scores did not differ .
10780,RESULTS,"Age , gender , socioeconomic status , and years of education were not predictive of total time or OAK test score ."
10781,CONCLUSIONS,"Use of informational videos coupled with teach-back questions significantly reduced pharmacist time spent on anticoagulation counseling without compromising short-term patient comprehension , primarily in patients with prior warfarin use ."
10782,CONCLUSIONS,Study results demonstrate that video technology provides an efficient method of anticoagulation counseling while achieving similar comprehension .
10783,BACKGROUND,The postpericardiotomy syndrome ( PPS ) is a common complication following cardiac surgery .

10802,METHODS,Platelet function was tested at baseline and then after clopidogrel treatment on day 3 .
10803,METHODS,"After a washout period of 2weeks , subjects were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive either citalopram 20mg/day or fluvoxamine 100mg/day for 7days ."
10804,METHODS,"On day 5 , platelet function was tested while receiving the SSRI treatment alone ; then , a 300-mg clopidogrel loading dose was administered , followed by clopidogrel 75mg/day on days 6 and 7 ."
10805,METHODS,Platelet function was then reassessed on day 7 while receiving the combination of the SSRI and clopidogrel .
10806,METHODS,The treatment protocol was then repeated after a washout period of 2weeks in all subjects with the other SSRI .
10807,RESULTS,The antiplatelet effects of fluvoxamine and citalopram and their interactions with clopidogrel were assessed .

10810,RESULTS,"All subjects had a good laboratory response to clopidogrel , with a mean aggregation of 23.53.2 % and a mean platelet reactivity index of 47.73.9 % ( p < 0.001 compared with baseline for both methods ) ."
10811,RESULTS,"Laboratory response to clopidogrel was significantly attenuated in the presence of fluvoxamine compared with the response in the presence of citalopram as tested both by aggregometry ( 32.34.2 % vs 23.43 % , p = 0.04 ) and by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation ( 52.75.1 % vs 35.94.2 % , p = 0.02 ) ."
10812,CONCLUSIONS,"Fluvoxamine attenuated the laboratory response to clopidogrel , possibly through inhibition of CYP2C19 , whereas citalopram did not affect this response ."
10813,CONCLUSIONS,These potential drug interactions should be taken into consideration in the selection of the appropriate antidepressant agent for patients who are treated with clopidogrel .

10820,METHODS,The effects of the intervention on traumatic memories and posttraumatic cognitions will be studied as potential mechanisms of change mediating overall treatment effectiveness .
10821,METHODS,"The possible moderating effects of peritraumatic dissociation , level of cognitive performance , and gender on treatment effectiveness will also be considered ."
10822,METHODS,"We hypothesize that NET will be more effective than a waitlist condition or TAU in reducing PTSD and other symptoms and improving resilience , and that these effects will be mediated by changes in traumatic memories and posttraumatic cognitions ."
10823,CONCLUSIONS,The results of this trial will provide evidence for the effectiveness of NET in treating trauma-related symptoms in immigrant children affected by war .
10824,CONCLUSIONS,"The trial will also generate insights into the complex relationships between PTSD , memory functions , posttraumatic cognitions and cognitive performance in children , and help guide the future development and implementation of therapeutic interventions for PTSD in children ."

11004,BACKGROUND,Randomized trials have not shown major survival benefits when induction chemotherapy plus standard therapy is compared with standard therapy alone in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) .
11005,BACKGROUND,Induction chemotherapy is likely to be effective for biologically distinct subgroups and biomarker development may lead to identification of patients whose tumors are likely to respond to a particular treatment .
11006,METHODS,"We evaluated immunohistochemical staining for GDF15 in pretreatment biopsy specimens of 230 of 256 OSCC patients who were treated in a prospective , randomized , phase III trial on induction chemotherapy including docetaxel , cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil ( TPF ) ."
11007,METHODS,"Relationship between GDF15 intervention and cell proliferation , migration , invasion , colony formation and tumorigenicity was analyzed using in vitro and in vivo OSCC models ."
11008,RESULTS,"Low GDF15 expression predicted a better survival in OSCC patients , especially overall survival [ P = 0.049 , hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.597 ] and distant metastasis-free survival ( DMFS ; P = 0.031 , HR = 0.562 ) ."
11009,RESULTS,"cN + patients with low GDF15 expression benefitted from induction TPF in overall survival ( P = 0.039 , HR = 0.247 ) and DMFS ( P = 0.039 , HR = 0.247 ) , cN - patients with high GDF15 expression benefitted from induction TPF in overall survival ( P = 0.019 , HR = 0.231 ) , disease-free survival ( P = 0.011 , HR = 0.281 ) , locoregional recurrence-free survival ( P = 0.035 , HR = 0.347 ) and DMFS ( P = 0.009 , HR = 0.197 ) ."
11010,RESULTS,"Decreased GDF15 expression in OSCC lines significantly inhibited cell proliferation , migration , invasion , colony formation and tumorigenesis through increased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 ( P < 0.05 ) ."

11015,BACKGROUND,The continued use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs ) and angiotensin II subtype I receptor antagonists ( ARBs ) medications in the preoperative period has been reported to be associated with intraoperative hypotension that can be unresponsive to pressor drugs .
11016,BACKGROUND,"As a result , several investigators suggested discontinuation of these medications before scheduled surgery but did not report on unintended consequences that might result from discontinuation ."
11017,BACKGROUND,"We conducted a prospective , single-blind , randomized trial to observe the effect of the medications on preoperative arterial blood pressure recordings in patients presenting for ambulatory and same-day surgery ."
11018,METHODS,Six hundred forty-four patients presenting for ambulatory and same-day surgery were enrolled prospectively between 2006 and 2011 and randomly assigned to 2 groups based on continuation or discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs .
11019,METHODS,An intention-to-treat analysis was performed .
11020,METHODS,The primary outcome was presence of hypertension ( HTN ) immediately before surgery .
11021,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes included surgical cancellations due to HTN , prolongation of hospitalization , adverse clinical events , and HTN in the postoperative period ."
11022,RESULTS,Data for 526 patients were analyzed .
11023,RESULTS,There were 262 patients in the discontinuation group and 264 patients in the continuation group .
11024,RESULTS,Discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs on the day of surgery was not associated with increased prevalence of preoperative HTN ( P = 0.775 ) .
11025,RESULTS,The upper bound of a 95 % confidence interval for the difference in prevalence of Stage 1 and 2 HTN between study arms indicates that discontinuation of study medication is unlikely to be associated with an increase in Stage 1 HTN of > 4.8 percentage points and in Stage 2 HTN of no > 5.8 percentage points .
11026,RESULTS,"Discontinuation was not associated with an increase in postoperative HTN , with prolongation of hospitalization or with adverse clinical events ."
11027,CONCLUSIONS,Discontinuing ACEIs and ARBs in patients on the day of surgery did not result in a substantively increased incidence of pre - or postoperative HTN compared with patients who continued these medications on the day of surgery .
11028,CONCLUSIONS,The results provide an evidentiary basis for the safety of discontinuing ACEIs and ARBs on the day of surgery without increasing adverse hemodynamic outcomes .

11050,RESULTS,Brachial-ankle PWV was significantly higher among A-positive participants at baseline and follow-up .
11051,RESULTS,Femoral-ankle PWV was only higher among A-positive participants at follow-up .
11052,RESULTS,"Measures of central stiffness and blood pressure were not associated with A status at baseline or follow-up , but central stiffness was associated with a change in A deposition over time ."
11053,RESULTS,"Each standard deviation increase in central stiffness ( carotid-femoral PWV , P = .001 ; heart-femoral PWV , P = .004 ) was linked with increases in A deposition over 2 years ."
11054,CONCLUSIONS,"This study showed that A deposition increases with age in nondemented individuals and that arterial stiffness is strongly associated with the progressive deposition of A in the brain , especially in this age group ."
11055,CONCLUSIONS,The association between A deposition changes over time and generalized arterial stiffness indicated a relationship between the severity of subclinical vascular disease and progressive cerebral A deposition .

11081,OBJECTIVE,"Heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction ( LVSD ) are common in patients with permanent pacemakers , but whether right ventricular ( RV ) pacing is contributory or merely a bystander in patients with more severe cardiac disease is controversial ."
11082,OBJECTIVE,The aim of the present study was to determine whether reprogramming of existing pacemakers to reduce RV pacing is safe and leads to improvements in cardiac function .
11083,METHODS,This was a prospective service evaluation of the effects of optimising pacemaker programming to avoid RV pacing in 66 consecutive attendees of a teaching hospital pacemaker clinic without complete heart block .
11084,METHODS,"The main outcome measures were left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-pro-BNP ) levels , quality of life and cardiopulmonary exercise testing at baseline and after 6 months ."
11085,RESULTS,"At 6 months , the protocol reduced absolute RV pacing by a mean of 49 % ( 95 % CI 41 % to 57 % ) ( p < 0.0001 from baseline ) and resulted in a mean absolute improvement in LVEF of 6 % ( 4 % to 8 % ) ( p < 0.0001 from baseline ) but no reduction in exercise capacity , NT-pro-BNP or quality of life ."
11086,RESULTS,There was a relationship between the magnitude of change in EF and the reduction in RV pacing ( p = 0.04 ) and changes in NT-pro-BNP seemed to relate to change in RV pacing ( p = 0.07 ) .

11358,RESULTS,They also showed improved HIV knowledge ( p < .01 ) and self-efficacy ( p < .05 ) .
11359,RESULTS,"The family-based intervention , compared with the other interventions , produced significant improvements in parent-teen sexual communication ( p < .01 ) , parental monitoring ( p < .01 ) , and parental permissiveness ( p = .05 ) ."
11360,CONCLUSIONS,"This RCT found that the HIV prevention interventions reduced sexual risk behavior over three months in a large , diverse sample of youths in mental health treatment and that the family-based intervention improved parental monitoring and communication with teens about sex ."
11361,CONCLUSIONS,These interventions show promise .
11362,BACKGROUND,Structured educational programmes for patients at risk for anaphylaxis have not yet been established .
11363,BACKGROUND,Patients and caregivers often lack adequate skills in managing the disease .
11364,METHODS,"To investigate effects of structured patient education intervention on knowledge , emergency management skills and psychological parameters in patients with previous episodes of anaphylaxis and caregivers of affected children 95 caregivers ( 11 male , 84 female , mean age 37years ) of affected children and 98 patients ( 32 male , 66 female , mean age 47.5 years ) were randomly assigned to an intervention ( IG ) or control group ( CG ) in a multicentre randomized controlled trial ."
11365,METHODS,The IG received two 3-h schooling modules of group education ; the CG received standard auto-injector training only .
11366,METHODS,Knowledge of anaphylaxis and emergency management competence in a validated training anaphylaxis situation as main outcome measures as well as secondary psychological parameters were assessed at baseline and 3months after intervention .
11367,RESULTS,"In comparison with controls , the intervention led to significant improvement of knowledge from baseline to 3-month follow-up ( caregivers : IG 3.2 / 13.2 improvement/baseline vs CG 0.7 / 12.6 ; P < 0.001 ; patients : IG 3.9 / 10.8 vs 1.3 / 12.6 ; P < 0.001 ) ."
11368,RESULTS,"Moreover , emergency management competence was increased after intervention as compared to controls ( caregivers : IG 8.6 / 11.2 vs CG 1.2 / 10.8 ; P < 0.001 ; patients : 7.1 / 11.0 vs 1.1 / 11.1 ; P < 0.001 ) ."
11369,RESULTS,Intervention showed significant reduction of caregiver anxiety ( -1.9 / 8.4 vs -0.7 / 7.5 ; P < 0.05 ) .
11370,RESULTS,There were no significant changes in the depression scores .
11371,CONCLUSIONS,Structured patient education programmes may be beneficial in the management of anaphylaxis by increasing patients ' empowerment to prevent and treat the disease .
11372,BACKGROUND,Postoperative atrial fibrillation ( POAF ) is considered to be a transient arrhythmia in the first week after cardiac surgery .
11373,OBJECTIVE,To determine the 30-day incidence and predictors of POAF and the value of postoperative overdrive biatrial pacing in the prevention of POAF .
11374,METHODS,Patients ( n = 148 ) without a history of atrial fibrillation undergoing aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) were randomized into a pacing group ( n = 75 ) and a control group .
11375,METHODS,Patients were treated with standardized sotalol postoperatively .
11376,METHODS,Rhythm was continuously monitored for 30 days by a transtelephonic event recorder .
11377,RESULTS,"POAF occurred in 73 ( 49.3 % ) patients , of whom 60 ( 40.5 % ) patients showed POAF during postoperative days ( PODs ) 0-5 and 37 ( 25 % ) patients during PODs 6-30 ."
11378,RESULTS,"Prolonged aortic cross-clamp time was an important univariate predictor of 30-day and of late POAF ( PODs 6-30 ; P = .017 and P = .03 , respectively ) ."
11379,RESULTS,"Best-fit model analysis using 15 predetermined risk factors for POAF showed different positive interactive effects for early POAF ( ie , baseline C-reactive protein levels with a history of myocardial infarction or low body mass index ) and late POAF ( ie , high body mass index , diabetes mellitus , baseline C-reactive protein , early POAF , creatinine levels , type of operation , smoking , and male gender ) ."
11380,RESULTS,Biatrial pacing reduced the late POAF incidence in patients with aortic cross-clamp time > 50 minutes ( P = .006 ) .
11381,CONCLUSIONS,POAF is not limited to the first week after cardiac surgery but also occurs frequently in the postoperative month .
11382,CONCLUSIONS,It is desirable to regularly follow patients with POAF for atrial fibrillation recurrences after discharge .
11383,BACKGROUND,Only about a third of patients with an episode of major depressive disorder remit with a given treatment and few remissions occur within the first weeks of treatment .
11384,BACKGROUND,This study tested whether combining escitalopram and bupropion as initial treatment would result in quicker remission and a higher remission rate than monotherapy with either drug .
11385,METHODS,"Two hundred forty-five outpatients aged 18-65 having non-psychotic , non-bipolar major depression were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with bupropion or escitalopram or the combination dosed to a maximum of bupropion 450 mg/d and/or escitalopram 40 mg/d for 12 weeks ."
11386,METHODS,"A Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score of 22 was required for randomization , while a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score 7 defined remission ."
11387,METHODS,We hypothesized that bupropion plus escitalopram would outperform both monotherapies in both earlier onset of remission and higher rate of remission .
11388,RESULTS,Primary analyses did not demonstrate that dual therapy outperformed both monotherapies in either timing of remission or remission rate .
11389,RESULTS,All three treatments were well tolerated .
11390,CONCLUSIONS,These results do not support initial use of bupropion plus escitalopram to speed or enhance antidepressant response .
11391,BACKGROUND,NCT00519428 .
11392,BACKGROUND,Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) often occurs after coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) and can result in increased morbidity and mortality due to complications .
11393,BACKGROUND,"In the present study , our goal was to investigate whether the use of levosimendan can reduce the frequency of AF after coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with poor left ventricle function ."
11394,METHODS,"To investigate the effectiveness of levosimendan in the prophylaxis of AF , we conducted a prospective , randomized , placebo-controlled clinical study on 200 consecutive patients in whom we performed elective CABG operations ."
11395,METHODS,Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups .
11396,METHODS,"A control group of 100 patients were treated with placebo ( 500 mL saline solution ) , whereas the levosimendan group ( n = 100 patients ) was treated with levosimendan ."
11397,METHODS,"High-sensitivity C-reactive protein , cardiac troponin , and creatine kinaseMB levels were measured before surgery and 5 days postoperatively ."
11398,RESULTS,AF occurred in 12 % of the levosimendan group and 36 % of the control group .
11399,RESULTS,The occurrence of AF was significantly lower in the levosimendan group ( P < 0.05 ) .
11400,RESULTS,"The duration of AF in the levosimendan group was significantly shorter than that in the control group ( 4.83 1.12 and 6.50 1.55 hours , respectively ; P = 0.028 ) ."
11401,RESULTS,Our research showed that C-reactive protein was higher postoperatively in the control group than in the levosimendan group ( P < 0.05 ) .
11402,CONCLUSIONS,The incidence of postoperative AF in the levosimendan group was reduced significantly in patients with poor left ventricle function after CABG operations .
11403,OBJECTIVE,"In lung cancer screening , the prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms is high among heavy smokers ."
11404,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this study was to compare CT-derived airway wall measurements between male smokers with and those without chronic respiratory symptoms .
11405,METHODS,"Fifty male heavy smokers with chronic respiratory symptoms ( cough , excessive mucus secretion , dyspnea , and wheezing ) and 50 without any respiratory symptom were randomly selected from the Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening Trial ."
11406,METHODS,Thin-slice low-dose CT images were evaluated with dedicated software for airway measurements .
11407,METHODS,Wall area percentage and airway wall thickness were measured from trachea to bronchi in five different pulmonary lobes of airways with a luminal diameter of 5 mm or greater .
11408,METHODS,"Association between airway wall measurements and respiratory symptoms was analyzed by multiple linear regression adjusted for age , body mass index , smoking status , emphysema , and pulmonary function ."
11409,RESULTS,"After adjustment for relevant factors , a significant positive association between airway wall measurements and respiratory symptoms was found in airways with a luminal diameter between 5 to 10 mm ( p < 0.01 ) , but not in airways measuring 10 mm or greater ( p > 0.05 ) ."
11410,RESULTS,"At the airway level between 5 to 10 mm , the mean wall area percentages were 51.5 % 7.9 % ."
11411,RESULTS,Airway wall thicknesses were 1.54 0.39 mm and 1.37 0.35 mm ( p < 0.001 ) .
11412,CONCLUSIONS,"Male heavy smokers with chronic respiratory symptoms in lung cancer screening , who are at high-risk of chronic bronchitis , have bronchial wall thickening in airways with a luminal diameter of 5-10 mm but not in larger airways ."
11413,BACKGROUND,Medical abortion with mifepristone and prostaglandins is well established .
11414,BACKGROUND,We compared clinical assessment with self-assessment of abortion outcome .

11416,METHODS,Women aged 18 years and older who had requested medical termination of a pregnancy up to 63 days of gestation were eligible .
11417,METHODS,Computer-generated block randomisation ( block size ten ) assigned women in a 1:1 ratio to attend routine clinical follow-up or to self-assess outcome at home with a semiquantitative urine human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test 1-3 weeks after abortion .
11418,METHODS,The primary outcome was the percentage of women with complete abortion not requiring further medical or surgical intervention within 3 months .
11419,METHODS,Analysis was per protocol and by intention to treat .
11420,METHODS,The non-inferiority margin was five percentage points .
11421,METHODS,"This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01487213 ."
11422,RESULTS,924 women were assigned routine follow-up ( n = 466 ) or self-assessment ( n = 458 ) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis .
11423,RESULTS,"901 were included in the per-protocol analysis ( n = 446 and n = 455 , respectively ) ."
11424,RESULTS,"Complete abortion was reported in 432 ( 95 % ) of 455 in the routine follow-up group and 419 ( 94 % ) of 446 women in the self-assessment group ( crude difference -10 , 95 % CI -40 to 20 ) ."

11432,METHODS,"We are assessing the incidence of hospitalization for virologically confirmed dengue as a surrogate safety end point during follow-up in years 3 to 6 of two phase 3 trials , CYD14 and CYD15 , and a phase 2b trial , CYD23/57 ."
11433,METHODS,We estimated vaccine efficacy using pooled data from the first 25 months of CYD14 and CYD15 .
11434,RESULTS,"Follow-up data were available for 10,165 of 10,275 participants ( 99 % ) in CYD14 and 19,898 of 20,869 participants ( 95 % ) in CYD15 ."
11435,RESULTS,Data were available for 3203 of the 4002 participants ( 80 % ) in the CYD23 trial included in CYD57 .
11436,RESULTS,"During year 3 in the CYD14 , CYD15 , and CYD57 trials combined , hospitalization for virologically confirmed dengue occurred in 65 of 22,177 participants in the vaccine group and 39 of 11,089 participants in the control group ."
11437,RESULTS,"Pooled relative risks of hospitalization for dengue were 0.84 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.56 to 1.24 ) among all participants , 1.58 ( 95 % CI , 0.83 to 3.02 ) among those under the age of 9 years , and 0.50 ( 95 % CI , 0.29 to 0.86 ) among those 9 years of age or older ."
11438,RESULTS,"During year 3 , hospitalization for severe dengue , as defined by the independent data monitoring committee criteria , occurred in 18 of 22,177 participants in the vaccine group and 6 of 11,089 participants in the control group ."

11466,OBJECTIVE,Clinical skills expertise can be advanced through accessible and cost-effective video-based observational practice activities .
11467,OBJECTIVE,Previous findings suggest that the observation of performances of skills that include flaws can be beneficial to trainees .
11468,OBJECTIVE,Observing the scope of variability within a skilled movement allows learners to develop strategies to manage the potential for and consequences associated with errors .
11469,OBJECTIVE,This study tests this observational learning approach on the development of the skills of central line insertion ( CLI ) .
11470,METHODS,"Medical trainees with no CLI experience ( n = 39 ) were randomised to three observational practice groups : a group which viewed and assessed videos of an expert performing a CLI without any errors ( F ) ; a group which viewed and assessed videos that contained a mix of flawless and errorful performances ( E ) , and a group which viewed the same videos as the E group but were also given information concerning the correctness of their assessments ( FA ) ."
11471,METHODS,All participants interacted with their observational videos each day for 4 days .
11472,METHODS,"Following this period , participants returned to the laboratory and performed a simulation-based insertion , which was assessed using a standard checklist and a global rating scale for the skill ."
11473,METHODS,These ratings served as the dependent measures for analysis .
11474,RESULTS,The checklist analysis revealed no differences between observational learning groups ( grand mean standard error : [ 20.3 0.7 ] / 25 ) .
11475,RESULTS,"However , the global rating analysis revealed a main effect of group ( d.f. 2,36 = 4.51 , p = 0.018 ) , which describes better CLI performance in the FA group , compared with the F and E groups ."
11476,CONCLUSIONS,Observational practice that includes errors improves the global performance aspects of clinical skill learning as long as learners are given confirmation that what they are observing is errorful .
11477,CONCLUSIONS,These findings provide a refined perspective on the optimal organisation of skill education programmes that combine physical and observational practice activities .

11485,OBJECTIVE,Pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy ( PPPD ) has been associated with a high incidence of delayed gastric emptying ( DGE ) .
11486,OBJECTIVE,There are few studies comparing DGE associated with PPPD and subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy ( SSPPD ) .
11487,OBJECTIVE,"Moreover , differences between the procedures with respect to long-term results have not been reported ."
11488,OBJECTIVE,A prospective randomized study was conducted to compare perioperative complications and long-term nutritional status with PPPD and SSPPD .
11489,METHODS,One hundred patients with periampullary lesions were randomized to receive either PPPD ( n = 50 ) or SSPPD ( n = 50 ) .

11496,OBJECTIVE,"To evaluate the effectiveness of two subsequent intervention components ( motivational and self-regulatory components ) , placed in different order , to promote fruit and vegetable ( FV ) intake ."
11497,METHODS,"After baseline assessment , university students ( N = 205 , aged 18-26 years ) were allocated to two groups ."
11498,METHODS,"One group received a motivational intervention ( outcome expectancies , risk perception , and task self-efficacy ) followed by a self-regulatory intervention ( planning and dietary self-efficacy ) after 17 days ."
11499,METHODS,The second group received the same intervention conditions in the opposite order .
11500,METHODS,Follow-up assessments were done after another 17 days .
11501,RESULTS,Both intervention sequences yielded gains in terms of FV intake and self-efficacy .
11502,RESULTS,"However , this gain was only due to the self-regulatory component whereas the motivational component did not contribute to the changes ."
11503,RESULTS,"Moreover , changes in intention and self-efficacy mediated between intervention sequence and follow-up behavior , suggesting that improving these proximal predictors of FV intake was responsible for the behavioral gains ."
11504,CONCLUSIONS,Findings highlight the superiority of a self-regulatory intervention over a motivational intervention when it comes to dietary changes in this sample of young adults .
11505,CONCLUSIONS,"Moreover , changes in dietary self-efficacy may drive nutritional changes ."

11512,OBJECTIVE,To compare tidal breathing on different continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) devices and pressures and to serially measure tidal breathing during weaning off CPAP using electromagnetic inductive plethysmography .
11513,METHODS,"Using electromagnetic inductive plethysmography , tidal breathing was measured in 29 preterm infants receiving CPAP , gestational age 28 2 weeks ."
11514,METHODS,"Variable-flow nasal CPAP ( nCPAP ) , bubble CPAP ( bCPAP ) at pressures of 5 , 7 , and 9 cmH2O , nasal bi-level positive airway pressure ( nBiPAP ) system at pressures of 5 , 7/5 , and 9/5 cmH2O , and unsupported breathing were studied ."
11515,METHODS,Twenty-one infants had weekly tidal breathing measurements on and off nCPAP .
11516,RESULTS,Minute volume ( MV/kg ) was similar between all devices ( 0.30-0 .33 L/kg/min ) .
11517,RESULTS,"On bCPAP , weight corrected tidal volume ( VT/kg ) was the least , changing little with increasing pressures ."
11518,RESULTS,"On nCPAP and nBiPAP , VT/kg increased with increasing pressure and the respiratory rate ( fR ) decreased ."
11519,RESULTS,The delivered pressure varied slightly from the set pressure being most dissimilar on nBiPAP and similar on bCPAP .
11520,RESULTS,"Compared with unsupported breathing , all devices decreased VT/kg , MV/kg , and phase angle , but did not alter fR ."
11521,RESULTS,Serial tidal breathing measurements showed decreasing difference for VT/kg over time on and off nCPAP .
11522,CONCLUSIONS,"At different pressure settings , on all CPAP devices the measured MV/kg was similar either through increasing VT/kg and decreasing fR ( nCPAP and nBiPAP ) or maintaining both ( bCPAP ) ."
11523,CONCLUSIONS,Serial tidal breathing measurements may aid weaning from CPAP .
11524,BACKGROUND,Epidemiologic data suggest that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D ] increases insulin resistance and the risk of type 2 diabetes .
11525,BACKGROUND,"Few interventional trials have assessed the effect of vitamin D on insulin metabolism , and published results are discordant ."
11526,OBJECTIVE,The goal of this study was to perform a detailed assessment of the effect of ergocalciferol administration on glucose and insulin metabolism in healthy people with low total 25 ( OH ) D ( total ) .

11535,CONCLUSIONS,"In healthy persons with low 25 ( OH ) D ( total ) , ergocalciferol administration for 12 wk normalizes 25 ( OH ) D ( total ) but does not improve insulin secretion , insulin sensitivity , or other markers of metabolic health ."
11536,BACKGROUND,"The high prevalence of physical inactivity has led to a search for novel and feasible interventions that will enhance physical activity , especially among the least physically active individuals ."
11537,BACKGROUND,This randomized controlled trial aimed to determine the effectiveness of a value-based intervention to promote a physically more active lifestyle among physically inactive adults .
11538,BACKGROUND,The framework of the study was based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) .
11539,METHODS,"Physically inactive participants aged 30 to 50years ( n = 138 ) were randomly allocated to a feedback ( FB , n = 69 ) or an acceptance - and commitment-based group ( ACT+FB , n = 69 ) ."
11540,METHODS,Both groups received written feedback about their objectively measured physical activity and were offered a body composition analysis .
11541,METHODS,"In addition , the participants in the ACT+FB group attended six group sessions and were given a pedometer for self-monitoring their physical activity during the nine-week intervention ."
11542,METHODS,The primary outcome was physical activity .
11543,METHODS,"In addition , participants ' cognitions related to exercise and physical activity were evaluated at baseline and at three - and six-month follow-ups ."
11544,METHODS,"The changes in mean physical activity level were analysed using multilevel random regression and rank order stability , using the structural equation model ."
11545,RESULTS,Participants in both groups increased their objectively measured and self-reported physical activity with high individual differences .
11546,RESULTS,No difference was observed in the change of physical activity level between the FB and ACT+FB groups over time .
11547,RESULTS,"However , the cognitions related to physical activity and exercise improved more in the ACT+FB group than in the FB group ."
11548,RESULTS,"In addition , after re-analyzing the data among the non-depressive participants , higher stability was observed in objectively measured physical activity at the individual level between the three - and six-month follow-ups in the ACT+FB group as compared to FB group ."
11549,CONCLUSIONS,"Acceptance - and commitment-based group intervention , combined with the self-monitoring of physical activity , was beneficial in supporting the cognition related to exercise and physical activity , and brought more stability to the individual level physical activity behaviour change , especially among the non-depressive participants ."

11695,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this study was to test causal effects of physicians ' nonverbal involvement on medical error disclosure outcomes .
11696,METHODS,216 hospital outpatients were randomly assigned to two experimental treatment groups .
11697,METHODS,The first group watched a video vignette of a verbally effective and nonverbally involved error disclosure .
11698,METHODS,The second group was exposed to a verbally effective but nonverbally uninvolved error disclosure .
11699,METHODS,All patients responded to seven outcome measures .
11700,RESULTS,Patients in the nonverbally uninvolved error disclosure treatment group perceived the physician 's apology as less sincere and remorseful compared to patients in the involved disclosure group .
11701,RESULTS,"They also rated the implications of the error as more severe , were more likely to ascribe fault to the physician , and indicated a higher intent to change doctors after the disclosure ."
11702,CONCLUSIONS,The results of this study imply that nonverbal involvement during medical error disclosures facilitates more accurate patient understanding and assessment of the medical error and its consequences on their health and quality of life .

11756,RESULTS,"After deriving a WAVE model based on all data , training-set performance demonstrated that the model increased its predictive power when applied to patients conventionally considered high risk : a WAVE score > 0.5 in patients with RSBI > 105 and perceived high risk of failure yielded a fold increase in risk of extubation failure of 3.0 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.2 to 5.2 ) and 3.5 ( 95 % CI 1.9 to 5.4 ) , respectively ."
11757,CONCLUSIONS,Altered HRV and RRV ( during the SBT prior to extubation ) are significantly associated with extubation failure .

11887,METHODS,"Metabolic syndrome prevalence , as well as weight , waist circumference , fat mass , and fasting biochemical markers ( glucose and lipid profile ) , were measured at baseline and at 2 , 4 , and 6 months after the intervention ."
11888,METHODS,"Metabolic syndrome risk ( relative risk and absolute risk reduction ) , mean differences between groups , and logistic regression were evaluated using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software , version 17.0 ."
11889,RESULTS,"A total of 118 women were studied ( mean [ SD ] age , 53.81 [ 6.43 ] y ) ."
11890,RESULTS,No baseline differences were observed between groups .
11891,RESULTS,"At the end of the study , a higher reduction in metabolic syndrome prevalence was observed in group 1 ( -38.1 % ) compared with group 2 ( -12.7 % ; relative risk , 0.237 ; 95 % CI , 0.092-0 .608 ; P = 0.003 ) ."
11892,RESULTS,"The effect was maintained even when adjusted by age , hormone therapy and antihypertensive drug use ."
11893,CONCLUSIONS,A cardioprotective structured hypocaloric diet is more effective than the BT approach in reducing metabolic syndrome after 6 months of intervention .
11894,CONCLUSIONS,Both strategies have positive effects on different individual cardiovascular risk factors .
11895,BACKGROUND,Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) are widely accepted as being the most efficient way of investigating the efficacy of psychological therapies .
11896,BACKGROUND,"However , researchers conducting RCTs commonly report difficulties in recruiting an adequate sample within planned timescales ."
11897,BACKGROUND,"In an effort to overcome recruitment difficulties , researchers often are forced to expand their recruitment criteria or extend the recruitment phase , thus increasing costs and delaying publication of results ."
11898,BACKGROUND,"Research investigating the effectiveness of recruitment strategies is limited , and trials often fail to report sufficient details about the recruitment sources and resources utilized ."
11899,OBJECTIVE,We examined the efficacy of strategies implemented during the Staying Well after Depression RCT in Oxford to recruit participants with a history of recurrent depression .
11900,METHODS,"We describe eight recruitment methods utilized and two further sources not initiated by the research team and examine their efficacy in terms of ( 1 ) the return , including the number of potential participants who contacted the trial and the number who were randomized into the trial ; ( 2 ) cost-effectiveness , comprising direct financial cost and manpower for initial contacts and randomized participants ; and ( 3 ) comparison of sociodemographic characteristics of individuals recruited from different sources ."
11901,RESULTS,"Poster advertising , web-based advertising , and mental health worker referrals were the cheapest methods per randomized participant ; however , the ratio of randomized participants to initial contacts differed markedly per source ."
11902,RESULTS,"Advertising online , via posters , and on a local radio station were the most cost-effective recruitment methods for soliciting participants who subsequently were randomized into the trial ."
11903,RESULTS,Advertising across many sources ( saturation ) was found to be important .
11904,CONCLUSIONS,"It may not be feasible to employ all the recruitment methods used in this trial to obtain participation from other populations , such as those currently unwell , or in other geographical locations ."
11905,CONCLUSIONS,Recruitment source was unavailable for participants who could not be reached after the initial contact .
11906,CONCLUSIONS,"Thus , it is possible that the efficiency of certain methods of recruitment was poorer than estimated ."
11907,CONCLUSIONS,"Efficacy and costs of other recruitment initiatives , such as providing travel expenses to the in-person eligibility assessment and making follow-up telephone calls to candidates who contacted the recruitment team but could not be screened promptly , were not analysed ."
11908,CONCLUSIONS,Website advertising resulted in the highest number of randomized participants and was the second cheapest method of recruiting .
11909,CONCLUSIONS,Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of recruitment strategies for other samples to contribute to a comprehensive base of knowledge for future RCTs .
11910,BACKGROUND,Interventions promoting physical activity by General Practitioners ( GPs ) lack a strong evidence base .
11911,BACKGROUND,Recruiting participants to trials in primary care is challenging .
11912,BACKGROUND,We investigated the feasibility of ( i ) delivering three interventions to promote physical activity in inactive participants and ( ii ) different methods of participant recruitment and randomised allocation .
11913,METHODS,"We recruited general practices from Devon , Bristol and Coventry ."
11914,METHODS,We used a 2-by-2 factorial design for participant recruitment and randomisation .
11915,METHODS,Recruitment strategies were either opportunistic ( approaching patients attending their GP surgery ) or systematic ( selecting patients from practice lists and approaching them by letter ) .
11916,METHODS,Randomisation strategies were either individual or by practice cluster .
11917,METHODS,Feasibility outcomes included time taken to recruit the target number of participants within each practice .
11918,METHODS,"Participants were randomly allocated to one of three interventions : ( i ) written advice ( control ) ; ( ii ) brief GP advice ( written advice plus GP advice on physical activity ) , and ( iii ) brief GP advice plus a pedometer to self-monitor physical activity during the trial ."
11919,METHODS,"Participants allocated to written advice or brief advice each received a sealed pedometer to record their physical activity , and were instructed not to unseal the pedometer before the scheduled day of data collection ."
11920,METHODS,"Participant level outcomes were reported descriptively and included the mean number of pedometer steps over a 7-day period , and European Quality of Life ( EuroQoL ) -5 dimensions ( EQ-5D ) scores , recorded at 12weeks ' follow-up ."
11921,RESULTS,"We recruited 24 practices ( 12 using each recruitment method ; 18 randomising by cluster , 6 randomising by individual participant ) , encompassing 131 participants ."
11922,RESULTS,"Opportunistic recruitment was associated with less time to target recruitment compared with systematic ( mean difference ( days ) -54.9 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) -103.6 ; -6.2 ) but with greater loss to follow up ( 28.8 % versus ."
11923,RESULTS,6.9 % ; mean difference 21.9 % ( 95 % CI 9.6 % ; 34.1 % ) ) .
11924,RESULTS,There were differences in the socio-demographic characteristics of participants according to recruitment method .
11925,RESULTS,There was no clear pattern of change in participant level outcomes from baseline to 12weeks across the three arms .
11926,CONCLUSIONS,"Delivering and trialling GP-led interventions to promote physical activity is feasible , but trial design influences time to participant recruitment , participant withdrawal , and possibly , the socio-demographic characteristics of participants ."

11928,BACKGROUND,"In this study we tested the hypothesis that tirasemtiv , a selective fast skeletal muscle troponin activator that sensitizes the sarcomere to calcium , could amplify the response of muscle to neuromuscular input in humans ."
11929,METHODS,"Healthy men received tirasemtiv and placebo in a randomized , double-blind , 4-period , crossover design ."
11930,METHODS,The deep fibular nerve was stimulated transcutaneously to activate the tibialis anterior muscle and produce dorsiflexion of the foot .
11931,METHODS,The force-frequency relationship of tibialis anterior dorsiflexion was assessed after dosing .
11932,RESULTS,"Tirasemtiv increased force produced by the tibialis anterior in a dose - , concentration - , and frequency-dependent manner with the largest increases [ up to 24.5 % ( SE 3.1 ) , P < 0.0001 ] produced at subtetanic nerve stimulation frequencies ( 10 Hz ) ."
11933,CONCLUSIONS,The data confirm that tirasemtiv amplifies the response of skeletal muscle to nerve input in humans .
11934,CONCLUSIONS,This outcome provides support for further studies of tirasemtiv as a potential therapy in conditions marked by diminished neuromuscular input .
11935,BACKGROUND,The present study addressed the ecological validity of the individual-focused experimental paradigm in sex research .
11936,OBJECTIVE,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of partner presence vs. absence in the laboratory testing situation , and of manipulation of attentional focus , on genital and subjective sexual arousal of healthy women and men ."
11937,METHODS,Sexually functional heterosexual men ( n = 12 ) and women ( n = 12 ) and their partners participated in this study .
11938,METHODS,"During partner presence , the partner sat opposite to the participant ; self-focused attention was experimentally manipulated by introducing , respectively , a semi-reflecting glass pane , and a wall-mounted camera ."
11939,METHODS,Perceived state self-focused attention and genital and subjective sexual arousal during presentation of audiovisual erotic film stimuli were assessed .
11940,RESULTS,Partner presence resulted in higher perceived self-focus ( ( p ) ( 2 ) = 0.22 ) and lower genital responses to erotic stimulation ( ( p ) ( 2 ) = 0.21 ) .
11941,RESULTS,The interaction of partner presence and increased self-focused attention differentially affected genital arousal in female and male participants ( ( p ) ( 2 ) = 0.38 ) .
11942,RESULTS,The mean genital response in men was lower during private self-focus than during non-self-focus with the partner present but was higher during private self-focus with the the partner absent ( ( p ) ( 2 ) = 0.23 ) .
11943,RESULTS,The genital response in women to public self-focus was lower than to private self-focus and to non-self-focus with their partner present ( ( p ) ( 2 ) = 0.36 ) .
11944,RESULTS,"With the partner absent , the genital response in women to private self-focus was lower than to non-self-focus ( ( p ) ( 2 ) = 0.23 ) ."
11945,RESULTS,"Retrospective subjective arousal of women was higher with partner present ( M = 3.2 ) than with partner absent ( M = 2.9 ) , whereas men reported higher retrospective subjective arousal with their partner absent ( M = 3.5 ) than present ( M = 3.1 ) ."
11946,CONCLUSIONS,These findings suggest that mere presence of the partner impacts the sexual response differentially in women and men .
11947,CONCLUSIONS,Enhancing the ecological validity of the individual-based laboratory paradigm for sex research warrants closer examination in future research .
11948,BACKGROUND,About one third of patients prescribed blood pressure or lipid-lowering drugs for the prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke do not take their medication as prescribed .
11949,BACKGROUND,We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate text messaging as a means of improving adherence to cardiovascular disease preventive treatment .
11950,METHODS,"303 patients taking blood pressure and/or lipid-lowering medications were randomly assigned to being sent text messages ( Text group , 151 ) or not being sent them ( No text group , 152 ) ."
11951,METHODS,"Texts were sent daily for 2 weeks , alternate days for 2 weeks and weekly thereafter for 22 weeks ( 6 months overall ) , using an automated computer programme ."
11952,METHODS,"Patients were asked to respond on whether they had taken their medication , whether the text reminded them to do so if they had forgotten , and if they had not taken their medication to determine if there was a reason for not doing so ."
11953,METHODS,"At 6 months , use of medication was assessed ."
11954,RESULTS,"Two patients were lost to follow-up , providing data on 301 for analysis ."
11955,RESULTS,In the No text group 38/151 ( 25 % ) took less than 80 % of the prescribed regimen ( ie .
11956,RESULTS,"stopped medication completely or took it on fewer than 22 of the last 28 days of follow-up ) compared to 14/150 patients ( 9 % ) in the Text group - an improvement in adherence affecting 16 per 100 patients ( 95 % CI 7 to 24 ) , p < 0.001 ."
11957,RESULTS,"The texts reminded 98/151 patients ( 65 % ) to take medication on at least one occasion and lead to 20/151 ( 13 % ) who stopped taking medication because of concern over efficacy or side-effects , resuming treatment ."
11958,CONCLUSIONS,"In patients taking blood pressure or lipid-lowering treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease , text messaging improved medication adherence compared with no text messaging ."

11961,METHODS,"A novel , fully bacterially produced recombinant virus-like particle ( VLP ) based influenza vaccine ( gH1-Qbeta ) against A/California/07 / 2009 ( H1N1 ) was tested in a double-blind , randomized phase I clinical trial at two clinical sites in Singapore ."
11962,METHODS,The trial evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of gH1-Qbeta in the presence or absence of alhydrogel adjuvant .
11963,METHODS,"Healthy adult volunteers with no or low pre-existing immunity against A/California/07 / 2009 ( H1N1 ) were randomized to receive two intramuscular injections 21 days apart , with 100g vaccine , containing 42g hemagglutinin antigen ."
11964,METHODS,Antibody responses were measured before and 21 days after each immunization by hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) assays .
11965,METHODS,"The primary endpoint was seroconversion on Day 42 , defined as percentage of subjects which reach a HAI titer 40 or achieve an at least 4-fold rise in HAI titer ( with pre-existing immunity ) ."
11966,METHODS,The co-secondary endpoints were safety and seroconversion on Day 21 .
11967,RESULTS,A total of 84 Asian volunteers were enrolled in this study and randomized to receive the adjuvanted ( n = 43 ) or the non-adjuvanted ( n = 41 ) vaccine .
11968,RESULTS,"Of those , 43 and 37 respectively ( 95 % ) completed the study ."
11969,RESULTS,There were no deaths or serious adverse events reported during this trial .
11970,RESULTS,"A total of 535 adverse events occurred during treatment with 49.5 % local solicited symptoms , of mostly ( 76.4 % ) mild severity ."
11971,RESULTS,The most common treatment-related systemic symptom was fatigue .
11972,RESULTS,The non-adjuvanted vaccine met all primary and secondary endpoints and showed seroconversion in 62.2 % and 70.3 % of participants respectively on Day 21 and Day 42 .
11973,RESULTS,"While the adjuvanted vaccine showed an increased seroconversion from 25.5 % ( Day 21 ) to 51.2 % ( Day 42 ) , it did not meet the immunogenicity endpoint ."
11974,CONCLUSIONS,"In summary , non-adjuvanted gH1-Qbeta showed similar antibody mediated immunogenicity and a comparable safety profile in healthy humans to commercially available vaccines ."
11975,CONCLUSIONS,These results warrant the consideration of this VLP vaccine platform for the vaccination against influenza infection ( HSA CTC1300092 ) .
11976,BACKGROUND,Two percent chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) is used in preparing the skin of surgical patients .
11977,BACKGROUND,"In practice , it often is diluted with saline prior to use ."
11978,BACKGROUND,"Whether this affects efficacy is unknown , as the manufacturer does not address dilution but does recommend scrubbing twice ."
11979,BACKGROUND,We attempted to determine whether diluting CHG affects its antiseptic potency and if one scrub is as effective as two .
11980,METHODS,"To test effects of CHG dilution , 60 healthy subjects were recruited and randomized into a dilution group ( 20 % , 40 % , 60 % , 80 % , or 100 % CHG ) or a control group ( saline ) ."
11981,METHODS,"One area of one foot of each subject was prepared , and colony-forming units ( CFU ) were counted at baseline and at 10min after preparation ."
11982,METHODS,"In a second study , 60 subjects were again recruited ."
11983,METHODS,"Based on the previous study , a 50 % dilution was applied as the scrub ."
11984,METHODS,Colony-forming units were calculated at baseline and after each CHG application .
11985,RESULTS,Baseline CFU did not differ among the dilution groups ( p = 0.49 ) .
11986,RESULTS,"Subjects in all dilution groups exhibited nearly a 100 % decrease in CFU , whereas the control group exhibited an 80 % decrease ."
11987,RESULTS,These results were statistically significant ( p < 0.01 ) .
11988,RESULTS,"In the second study , the CFU values after two scrubs ( mean 0.1 ; range 0-3 ) were significantly lower than after one scrub ( mean 3.6 , range 0-100 ) ( p = 0.02 ) ."
11989,CONCLUSIONS,Diluting CHG to a concentration as low as 0.4 % does not affect antiseptic efficacy .
11990,CONCLUSIONS,The manufacturer-recommended two scrubs is superior to one scrub at reducing skin bacterial colony counts .

12002,BACKGROUND,Intravenous loop diuretics are a cornerstone of therapy in acutely decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) .
12003,BACKGROUND,We sought to determine if there are any differences in clinical outcomes between intravenous bolus and continuous infusion of loop diuretics .
12004,METHODS,Subjects with ADHF within 12 hours of hospital admission were randomly assigned to continuous infusion or twice daily bolus therapy with furosemide .
12005,METHODS,"There were three co-primary endpoints assessed from admission to discharge : the mean paired changes in serum creatinine , estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) , and reduction in B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) ."
12006,METHODS,"Secondary endpoints included the rate of acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , change in body weight and six months follow-up evaluation after discharge ."
12007,RESULTS,A total of 43 received a continuous infusion and 39 were assigned to bolus treatment .
12008,RESULTS,"At discharge , the mean change in serum creatinine was higher ( +0.8 0.4 versus -0.8 0.3 mg/dl P < 0.01 ) , and eGFR was lower ( -9 7 versus +5 6 ml/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) P < 0.05 ) in the continuous arm ."
12009,RESULTS,There was no significant difference in the degree of weight loss ( -4.1 1.9 versus -3.5 2.4 kg P = 0.23 ) .
12010,RESULTS,"The continuous infusion arm had a greater reduction in BNP over the hospital course , ( -576 655 versus -181 527 pg/ml P = 0.02 ) ."
12011,RESULTS,The rates of AKI were comparable ( 22 % and 15 % P = 0.3 ) between the two groups .
12012,RESULTS,"There was more frequent use of hypertonic saline solutions for hyponatremia ( 33 % versus 18 % P < 0.01 ) , intravenous dopamine infusions ( 35 % versus 23 % P = 0.02 ) , and the hospital length of stay was longer in the continuous infusion group ( 14.3 5 versus 11.5 4 days , P < 0.03 ) ."
12013,RESULTS,"At 6 months there were higher rates of re-admission or death in the continuous infusion group , 58 % versus 23 % , ( P = 0.001 ) and this mode of treatment independently associated with this outcome after adjusting for baseline and intermediate variables ( adjusted hazard ratio = 2.57 , 95 % confidence interval , 1.01 to 6.58 P = 0.04 ) ."
12014,CONCLUSIONS,"In the setting of ADHF , continuous infusion of loop diuretics resulted in greater reductions in BNP from admission to discharge ."
12015,CONCLUSIONS,"However , this appeared to occur at the consequence of worsened renal filtration function , use of additional treatment , and higher rates of rehospitalization or death at six months ."

12021,BACKGROUND,"We also hypothesized that in responders , hydrocortisone augmentation would be more effective in reversing glucocorticoid indices associated with PTSD than placebo augmentation ."
12022,METHODS,Twenty-four veterans were randomized to receive either 30 mg oral hydrocortisone or placebo prior to PE sessions 3-10 in a double-blind protocol .
12023,METHODS,Glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity was assessed in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) using the in vitro lysozyme inhibition test and was determined before and after treatment .
12024,METHODS,Intent-to-treat analysis was performed using latent growth curve modeling of treatment effects on change in PTSD severity over time .
12025,METHODS,Veterans who no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD at post-treatment were designated as responders .
12026,RESULTS,Veterans randomized to hydrocortisone or placebo augmentation did not differ significantly in clinical severity or glucocorticoid sensitivity at pre-treatment .
12027,RESULTS,"Hydrocortisone augmentation was associated with greater reduction in total PTSD symptoms compared to placebo , a finding that was explained by significantly greater patient retention in the hydrocortisone augmentation condition ."
12028,RESULTS,A significant treatment condition by responder status interaction for glucocorticoid sensitivity indicated that responders to hydrocortisone augmentation had the highest pre-treatment glucocorticoid sensitivity ( lowest lysozyme IC50-DEX ) that diminished over the course of treatment .
12029,RESULTS,There was a significant association between decline in glucocorticoid responsiveness and improvement in PTSD symptoms among hydrocortisone recipients .
12030,CONCLUSIONS,The results of this pilot study suggest that hydrocortisone augmentation of PE may result in greater retention in treatment and thereby promote PTSD symptom improvement .
12031,CONCLUSIONS,"Further , the results suggest that particularly elevated glucocorticoid responsiveness at pre-treatment may identify veterans likely to respond to PE combined with an intervention that targets glucocorticoid sensitivity ."
12032,CONCLUSIONS,Confirmation of these findings will suggest that pharmacologic interventions that target PTSD-associated glucocorticoid dysregulation may be particularly helpful in promoting a positive clinical response to PTSD psychotherapy .

12035,BACKGROUND,Dual blockade of the RAAS may circumvent compensatory mechanisms that limit the efficacy of monotherapy with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor or angiotensin II-receptor blocker ( ARB ) .
12036,METHODS,"In this double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , we randomly assigned 486 patients , 18 to 64 years of age , with ADPKD ( estimated glomerular filtration rate [ GFR ] , 25 to 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m ( 2 ) of body-surface area ) to receive an ACE inhibitor ( lisinopril ) and placebo or lisinopril and an ARB ( telmisartan ) , with the doses adjusted to achieve a blood pressure of 110/70 to 130/80 mm Hg ."
12037,METHODS,"The composite primary outcome was the time to death , end-stage renal disease , or a 50 % reduction from the baseline estimated GFR ."

12039,METHODS,Patients were followed for 5 to 8 years .
12040,RESULTS,"There was no significant difference between the study groups in the incidence of the composite primary outcome ( hazard ratio with lisinopril-telmisartan , 1.08 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.82 to 1.42 ) ."
12041,RESULTS,The two treatments controlled blood pressure and lowered urinary aldosterone excretion similarly .
12042,RESULTS,"The rates of decline in the estimated GFR , urinary albumin excretion , and other secondary outcomes and adverse events , including hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury , were also similar in the two groups ."
12043,CONCLUSIONS,Monotherapy with an ACE inhibitor was associated with blood-pressure control in most patients with ADPKD and stage 3 chronic kidney disease .

12050,METHODS,The intensity of postoperative analgesia was measured using a verbal rating scale ( VRS ) .
12051,METHODS,The total amounts of rescue analgesics were recorded on the first and during seven postoperative days .
12052,METHODS,Patients satisfaction was noted using a modified verbal scales .
12053,RESULTS,A significantly higher level of postoperative pain was recorded in Lid + Epi group compared to Bup and Lbup groups .
12054,RESULTS,"No significant differences were seen between Bup and Lbup , but a significant reduction in the need for rescue analgesics was seen postoperatively in both Lbup and Bup ( 50 % ) in comparison with Lid + Epi ( 80 % ) in the first 24 hours ."
12055,RESULTS,The same significant trend in rescue analgesic consumption was recorded for seven postoperative days .
12056,RESULTS,Patients ' overall satisfaction was significantly lower for Lid + Epi ( 10 % ) than for Lbup ( 56 % ) and Bup ( 52 % ) .
12057,CONCLUSIONS,The use of a new and long-acting local anaesthetic 0.5 % levobupivacaine is clinically relevant and effective for an inferior alveolar nerve block and postoperative pain control after third molar surgery .
12058,CONCLUSIONS,In our study Lbup and Bup controled postoperative pain more efficiently after lower third molar surgery compared to Lid + Epi .
12059,BACKGROUND,Awake fiberoptic intubation is the gold standard for management of predicted difficult intubation .
12060,BACKGROUND,The purpose of this study was to test whether Glide Scope video laryngoscopy ( GVL ) will provide significant advantages over fiberoptic bronchoscopy ( FOB ) for awake intubation in morbidly obese patients with predicted difficult intubation .
12061,BACKGROUND,We therefore tested the hypothesis that intubation using GVL is faster than intubation with FOB .

12101,RESULTS,"Compared to routine care the test-treat package resulted in less diagnoses of malaria , ( 37.2 % vs 46.2 % , p = 0.190 ) and mixed malaria and bacterial infections ( 14.0 % vs 53.8 % , p < 0.001 ) but more diagnoses of viral ( 33.1 % vs 0.0 % , p < 0.001 ) and bacterial infections only ( 15.7 % vs 0.0 % , p < 0.001 ) ."
12102,RESULTS,"Less anti-malarials ( 51.2 % vs 100.0 % , p < 0.001 ) and antibiotics ( 29.7 % vs 48.7 % , p < 0.001 ) , were prescribed in the test-treat group on completion of study , more test-treat package patients were clinically well ( 99.2 % vs 80.7 % , p < 0.001 ) and febrile ( 0.8 % vs 10.1 % , p = 0.001 ) and less were admitted for inpatient care ( 0.0 % vs 8.4 % p = 0.001 ) compared to the routine care group ."
12103,CONCLUSIONS,Test-treat package improves the effectiveness of outpatient diagnosis and treatment of children with fever and reduces inappropriate prescribing of anti-malarials and antibiotics .
12104,CONCLUSIONS,The package provides clinicians with the option for immediate diagnosis and treatment of non-malaria fevers .
12105,CONCLUSIONS,The test-treat package now needs to be evaluated in other settings including primary health care facilities .
12106,BACKGROUND,The 2007 American College of Cardiologists/American Heart Association Guidelines on Perioperative Cardiac Evaluation and Care for Noncardiac Surgery is the standard for perioperative cardiac evaluation .
12107,BACKGROUND,Recent work has shown that residents and anesthesiologists do not apply these guidelines when tested .
12108,BACKGROUND,This research hypothesized that a decision support tool would improve adherence to this consensus guideline .
12109,METHODS,"Anesthesiology residents at four training programs participated in an unblinded , prospective , randomized , cross-over trial in which they completed two tests covering clinical scenarios ."
12110,METHODS,One quiz was completed from memory and one with the aid of an electronic decision support tool .
12111,METHODS,"Performance was evaluated by overall score ( % correct ) , number of incorrect answers with possibly increased cost or risk of care , and the amount of time required to complete the quizzes both with and without the cognitive aid ."
12112,METHODS,The primary outcome was the proportion of correct responses attributable to the use of the decision support tool .
12113,RESULTS,All anesthesiology residents at four institutions were recruited and 111 residents participated .
12114,RESULTS,"Use of the decision support tool resulted in a 25 % improvement in adherence to guidelines compared with memory alone ( P < 0.0001 ) , and participants made 77 % fewer incorrect responses that would have resulted in increased costs ."
12115,RESULTS,Use of the tool was associated with a 3.4-min increase in time to complete the test ( P < 0.001 ) .
12116,CONCLUSIONS,Use of an electronic decision support tool significantly improved adherence to the guidelines as compared with memory alone .
12117,CONCLUSIONS,The decision support tool also prevented inappropriate management steps possibly associated with increased healthcare costs .
12118,OBJECTIVE,"To examine the relationships between stressful life events and physiological measures , adherence to prescribed oral medication regimens , depressive symptoms , and impaired quality of life ( QoL ) in adolescents with recent-onset type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) ."
12119,METHODS,Data were collected from 497 ethnically diverse participants ( 66 % female ) in the final year of the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth multicenter clinical trial .
12120,METHODS,Exposure to 32 possible events over the previous year and rating of subsequent distress were collected by self-report and summarized as a major stressors score .
12121,METHODS,"This score was analyzed for relationship to glycemic control ( hemoglobin A1c and treatment failure ) , body mass index , diagnosis of hypertension or triglyceride dyslipidemia , adherence to a prescribed oral medication regimen , presence of depressive symptoms , and impaired QoL ."
12122,RESULTS,"The total number of major stressful life events in the adolescents with T2D was calculated , with 33 % reporting none , 67 % reporting 1 , 47 % reporting 2 , 33 % reporting 3 , and 20 % reporting 4 ."
12123,RESULTS,There were no associations between the major stressors score and physiological measures or diagnosis of comorbidities .
12124,RESULTS,"The odds of medication nonadherence increased significantly from those reporting 1 major stressor ( OR , 1.58 ; P = .0265 ) to those reporting 4 major stressors ( OR , 2.70 ; P = .0009 ) ."
12125,RESULTS,Significant odds of elevated depressive symptoms and impaired QoL were also found with increased reporting of major stressors .
12126,CONCLUSIONS,Exposure to major stressful life events is associated with lower adherence to prescribed oral medication regimens and impaired psychosocial functioning in adolescents with T2D .
12127,OBJECTIVE,Low back pain ( LBP ) is responsible for more than 2.5 million visits to US emergency departments ( EDs ) annually .

12137,METHODS,"They were randomized to receive either 60 tablets of placebo ; cyclobenzaprine , 5 mg ; or oxycodone , 5 mg/acetaminophen , 325 mg ."
12138,METHODS,"Participants were instructed to take 1 or 2 of these tablets every 8 hours , as needed for LBP ."
12139,METHODS,They also received a standardized 10-minute LBP educational session prior to discharge .
12140,METHODS,The primary outcome was improvement in RMDQ between ED discharge and 1 week later .
12141,RESULTS,Demographic characteristics were comparable among the 3 groups .
12142,RESULTS,"At baseline , median RMDQ score in the placebo group was 20 ( interquartile range [ IQR ] ,17 -21 ) , in the cyclobenzaprine group 19 ( IQR,17-21 ) , and in the oxycodone/acetaminophen group 20 ( IQR,17-22 ) ."
12143,RESULTS,"At 1-week follow-up , the mean RMDQ improvement was 9.8 in the placebo group , 10.1 in the cyclobenzaprine group , and 11.1 in the oxycodone/acetaminophen group ."
12144,RESULTS,"Between-group difference in mean RMDQ improvement for cyclobenzaprine vs placebo was 0.3 ( 98.3 % CI , -2.6 to 3.2 ; P = .77 ) , for oxycodone/acetaminophen vs placebo , 1.3 ( 98.3 % CI , -1.5 to 4.1 ; P = .28 ) , and for oxycodone/acetaminophen vs cyclobenzaprine , 0.9 ( 98.3 % CI , -2.1 to 3.9 ; P = .45 ) ."
12145,CONCLUSIONS,"Among patients with acute , nontraumatic , nonradicular LBP presenting to the ED , adding cyclobenzaprine or oxycodone/acetaminophen to naproxen alone did not improve functional outcomes or pain at 1-week follow-up ."

12397,OBJECTIVE,"In alcohol-dependent patients , alcohol cues evoke increased activation in mesolimbic brain areas , such as the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala ."
12398,OBJECTIVE,"Moreover , patients show an alcohol approach bias , a tendency to more quickly approach than avoid alcohol cues ."
12399,OBJECTIVE,"Cognitive bias modification training , which aims to retrain approach biases , has been shown to reduce alcohol craving and relapse rates ."
12400,OBJECTIVE,The authors investigated effects of this training on cue reactivity in alcohol-dependent patients .
12401,METHODS,"In a double-blind randomized design , 32 abstinent alcohol-dependent patients received either bias modification training or sham training ."
12402,METHODS,"Both trainings consisted of six sessions of the joystick approach-avoidance task ; the bias modification training entailed pushing away 90 % of alcohol cues and 10 % of soft drink cues , whereas this ratio was 50/50 in the sham training ."
12403,METHODS,Alcohol cue reactivity was measured with functional MRI before and after training .
12404,RESULTS,"Before training , alcohol cue-evoked activation was observed in the amygdala bilaterally , as well as in the right nucleus accumbens , although here it fell short of significance ."
12405,RESULTS,Activation in the amygdala correlated with craving and arousal ratings of alcohol stimuli ; correlations in the nucleus accumbens again fell short of significance .
12406,RESULTS,"After training , the bias modification group showed greater reductions in cue-evoked activation in the amygdala bilaterally and in behavioral arousal ratings of alcohol pictures , compared with the sham training group ."
12407,RESULTS,Decreases in right amygdala activity correlated with decreases in craving in the bias modification but not the sham training group .

12415,RESULTS,"Sublingual group had significantly more cervical dilatation and shorter operative time than oral group ( 7.3 + / - 1.5 vs. 5.9 + / - 1.4 mm , p < 0.001 and 5.2 + / - 3.3 vs. 7.3 + / - 4.6 min , p = 0.02 , respectively ) ."
12416,RESULTS,"However there were similar side effects , pain scores , and patient satisfactions in two groups ."
12417,RESULTS,"The present study had no uterine perforation , cervical tear hemorrhage , or re-evacuation ."
12418,CONCLUSIONS,Sublingual misoprostol route was more effective for cervical priming prior to MVA in first trimester therapeutic abortion than oral route .
12419,OBJECTIVE,"To compare the safety and efficacy of laser debulking ( LD ) and drug-eluting balloon ( DEB ) angioplasty to treatment with DEB angioplasty alone in patients affected by critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) and superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) chronic stent occlusion in a prospective , randomized study ."
12420,METHODS,"Among 448 CLI patients treated from December 2009 to March 2011 , 48 patients ( 39 men ; mean age 72.77.8 years ) with chronic SFA in-stent occlusion were randomly assigned to treatment using LD+DEB ( n = 24 ) or DEB angioplasty alone ( n = 24 ) ."
12421,METHODS,Patency at 12 months was the primary outcome measure ; secondary outcomes were target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) and clinical success at 12 months .
12422,RESULTS,"In the LD+DEB group , the patency rates at 6 and 12 months ( 91.7 % and 66.7 % , respectively ) were significantly higher ( p = 0.01 ) than in the DEB only patients ( 58.3 % and 37.5 % , respectively ) ."
12423,RESULTS,TLR at 12 months was 16.7 % in the LD+DEB group and 50 % in the DEB only group ( p = 0.01 ) .
12424,RESULTS,Two ( 8 % ) patients needed major amputations in the LD+DEB group vs. 11 ( 46 % ) in the DEB only group at 12 months ( p = 0.003 ) .
12425,CONCLUSIONS,"In this small initial experience , combined treatment with LD and DEB angioplasty is correlated with better outcomes in CLI patients with occluded SFA stents ."
12426,OBJECTIVE,"Hypertension is one of the most common co-existing conditions in patients with chronic pain , and the potential effects of an analgesic on heart rate and blood pressure are of particular concern for patients with hypertension ."
12427,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate changes in blood pressure and heart rate with tapentadol extended release ( ER ) treatment in patients with hypertension .
12428,METHODS,"We performed a post hoc analysis of data pooled from three randomized , placebo - and active-controlled , phase III studies of tapentadol ER for managing chronic osteoarthritis knee ( NCT00421928 , NCT00486811 ) or low back ( NCT00449176 ) pain ( 15-week , double-blind treatment period ) ."
12429,METHODS,Data were independently analyzed for patients with a listed medical history of hypertension at baseline and patients with at least one listed concomitant antihypertensive medication at baseline .
12430,METHODS,"Heart rate , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , and diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) were measured at each visit ."
12431,RESULTS,"In patients with a listed medical history of hypertension ( n = 1,464 ) , least-squares mean ( LSM [ standard error ( SE ) ] ) changes from baseline to endpoint with placebo , tapentadol ER , and oxycodone HCl controlled release ( CR ) , respectively , were -0.7 ( 0.44 ) , 0.2 ( 0.43 ) , and -0.9 ( 0.45 ) beats per minute ( bpm ) for heart rate ; -2.4 ( 0.64 ) , -2.7 ( 0.64 ) , and -3.7 ( 0.67 ) mmHg for SBP ; and -1.0 ( 0.39 ) , -1.3 ( 0.39 ) , and -2.3 ( 0.41 ) mmHg for DBP ; in patients with at least one listed concomitant antihypertensive medication ( n = 1,376 ) , the LSM ( SE ) changes from baseline to endpoint were -0.6 ( 0.45 ) , 0.1 ( 0.44 ) , and -0.7 ( 0.47 ) bpm for heart rate ; -1.8 ( 0.66 ) , -3.3 ( 0.65 ) , and -3.7 ( 0.69 ) mmHg for SBP ; and -0.7 ( 0.40 ) , -1.4 ( 0.40 ) , and -2.3 ( 0.42 ) mmHg for DBP ."

12451,METHODS,"In this multicenter , prospective , randomized controlled trial , patients with curative gastric cancer were randomly assigned to undergo gastrectomy either with LigaSure or a conventional technique ."
12452,RESULTS,"Of the 160 patients enrolled , 80 were randomized to the LigaSure group and 78 to the conventional group ."
12453,RESULTS,Patient characteristics were well balanced in the two groups .
12454,RESULTS,"There were no significant differences between the LigaSure and conventional groups in blood loss ( 288 vs. 260ml , respectively ; P = 0.748 ) or operative time ( 223 and 225min , respectively ; P = 0.368 ) ; nor in the incidence of surgical complications or duration of postoperative hospital stay ."
12455,RESULTS,"In a subgroup analysis of patients who underwent gastrectomy that preserved the distal part of the greater omentum , the use of LigaSure significantly reduced blood loss ( 179 vs. 245ml ; P = 0.033 ) , and the duration of the operation ( 195 vs. 221min ; P = 0.039 ) ."
12456,CONCLUSIONS,"LigaSure did not contribute to reducing intraoperative blood loss , operative time , or other adverse surgical outcomes ."
12457,CONCLUSIONS,The usefulness of the device may be limited to a specific part of the surgical procedure in open gastrectomy .
12458,BACKGROUND,Cerebral microbleeds have been observed in normal-appearing brain tissue of patients with glioma years after receiving radiation therapy .
12459,BACKGROUND,The contrast of these paramagnetic lesions varies with field strength due to differences in the effects of susceptibility .
12460,BACKGROUND,The purpose of this study was to compare 3T and 7T MRI as platforms for detecting cerebral microbleeds in patients treated with radiotherapy using susceptibility-weighted imaging ( SWI ) .
12461,METHODS,SWI was performed with both 3T and 7T MR scanners on ten patients with glioma who had received prior radiotherapy .
12462,METHODS,Imaging sequences were optimized to obtain data within a clinically acceptable scan time .
12463,METHODS,"Both T2 * - weighted magnitude images and SWI data were reconstructed , minimum intensity projection was implemented , and microbleeds were manually identified ."
12464,METHODS,The number of microbleeds was counted and compared among datasets .
12465,RESULTS,Significantly more microbleeds were identified on SWI than magnitude images at both 7T ( p = 0.002 ) and 3T ( p = 0.023 ) .
12466,RESULTS,"Seven-tesla SWI detected significantly more microbleeds than 3T SWI for seven out of ten patients who had tumors located remote from deep brain regions ( p = 0.016 ) , but when the additional three patients with more inferior tumors were included , the difference was not significant ."
12467,CONCLUSIONS,SWI is more sensitive for detecting microbleeds than magnitude images at both 3T and 7T .
12468,CONCLUSIONS,"For areas without heightened susceptibility artifacts , 7T SWI is more sensitive to detecting radiation therapy-induced microbleeds than 3T SWI ."
12469,CONCLUSIONS,Tumor location should be considered in conjunction with field strength when selecting the most appropriate strategy for imaging microbleeds .

12485,OBJECTIVE,Behavioral interventions are used to treat disruptive behavior but have not been evaluated in large-scale randomized trials .
12486,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the efficacy of parent training for children with autism spectrum disorder and disruptive behavior .
12487,METHODS,"This 24-week randomized trial compared parent training ( n = 89 ) to parent education ( n = 91 ) at 6 centers ( Emory University , Indiana University , Ohio State University , University of Pittsburgh , University of Rochester , Yale University ) ."
12488,METHODS,"We screened 267 children ; 180 children ( aged 3-7 years ) with autism spectrum disorder and disruptive behaviors were randomly assigned ( 86 % white , 88 % male ) between September 2010 and February 2014 ."
12489,METHODS,"Parent training ( 11 core , 2 optional sessions ; 2 telephone boosters ; 2 home visits ) provided specific strategies to manage disruptive behavior ."
12490,METHODS,"Parent education ( 12 core sessions , 1 home visit ) provided information about autism but no behavior management strategies ."
12491,METHODS,"Parents rated disruptive behavior and noncompliance on co-primary outcomes : the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale ( range , 0-45 ) and the Home Situations Questionnaire-Autism Spectrum Disorder ( range , 0-9 ) ."
12492,METHODS,"On both measures , higher scores indicate greater severity and a 25 % reduction indicates clinical improvement ."
12493,METHODS,"A clinician blind to treatment assignment rated the Improvement scale of the Clinical Global Impression ( range , 1-7 ) , a secondary outcome , with a positive response less than 3 ."
12494,RESULTS,"At week 24 , the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale declined 47.7 % in parent training ( from 23.7 to 12.4 ) compared with 31.8 % for parent education ( 23.9 to 16.3 ) ( treatment effect , -3.9 ; 95 % CI , -6.2 to -1.7 ; P < .001 , standardized effect size = 0.62 ) ."

12507,RESULTS,"The entire sample had sustained long-term effects from pre-treatment to all follow-up assessments , with large within-group effect sizes ( Cohen 's d = 1.58-2 .09 ) ."
12508,RESULTS,"The booster group had a significant mean reduction in OCD symptoms compared to the control condition from booster baseline ( 4 months ) to 7 months , but not at 12 or 24 months ."
12509,RESULTS,"Participants in the booster group improved significantly in terms of general functioning at 7 , 12 and 24 months , and had fewer relapses ."
12510,RESULTS,Kaplan-Meier analysis also indicated a significantly slower relapse rate in the booster group .
12511,CONCLUSIONS,The results suggest that ICBT has sustained long-term effects and that adding an Internet-based booster program can further improve long-term outcome and prevent relapse for some OCD patients .
12512,BACKGROUND,Data from an open label randomised controlled trial have suggested possible advantages on both motor and non-motor measures in patients with Parkinson 's disease following 12 months exposure to exenatide .
12513,OBJECTIVE,Continued follow up of these same patients was performed to investigate whether these possible advantages persisted in the prolonged absence of this medication .
12514,METHODS,"All participants from an open label , randomised controlled trial of exenatide as a treatment for Parkinson 's disease , were invited for a further follow up assessment at the UCL Institute of Neurology ."
12515,METHODS,This visit included all 20 individuals who had previously completed twelve months exposure to exenatide 10ug bd and the 24 individuals who had acted as randomised controls .
12516,METHODS,"Motor severity of PD was compared after overnight withdrawal of conventional PD medication using blinded video assessment of the MDS-UPDRS , together with several non-motor tests ."
12517,METHODS,"This assessment was thus 24 months after their original baseline visit , i.e. 12 months after cessation of exenatide ."
12518,RESULTS,"Compared to the control group of patients , patients previously exposed to exenatide had an advantage of 5.6 points ( 95 % CI , 2.2-9 .0 ; p = 0.002 ) using blinded video rating of the MDS-UPDRS part 3 motor subscale ."
12519,RESULTS,"There was also a difference of 5.3 points ; ( 95 % CI , 9.3-1 .4 ; p = 0.006 ) between the 2 groups on the Mattis Dementia Rating scale ."
12520,CONCLUSIONS,"While these data must still not be interpreted as evidence of neuroprotection , they nevertheless provide strong encouragement for the further study of this drug as a potential disease modifying agent in Parkinson 's disease ."

12558,BACKGROUND,Little is known about how colorectal cancer screening test preferences operate together with test access and navigation to influence screening adherence in primary care .
12559,METHODS,"We analyzed data from a randomized trial of 945 primary care patients to assess the independent effects of screening test preference for fecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) or colonoscopy , mailed access to FIT and colonoscopy , and telephone navigation for FIT and colonoscopy , on screening ."
12560,RESULTS,"Preference was not associated with overall screening , but individuals who preferred FIT were more likely to complete FIT screening ( P = 0.005 ) , whereas those who preferred colonoscopy were more likely to perform colonoscopy screening ( P = 0.032 ) ."
12561,RESULTS,"Mailed access to FIT and colonoscopy was associated with increased overall screening ( OR = 2.6 , P = 0.001 ) , due to a 29-fold increase in FIT use ."
12562,RESULTS,"Telephone navigation was also associated with increased overall screening ( OR = 2.1 , P = 0.005 ) , mainly due to a 3-fold increase in colonoscopy performance ."
12563,RESULTS,"We estimated that providing access and navigation for both screening tests may substantially increase screening compared with a preference-tailored approach , mainly due to increased performance of nonpreferred tests ."
12564,CONCLUSIONS,Preference influences the type of screening tests completed .
12565,CONCLUSIONS,Test access increases FIT and navigation mainly increases colonoscopy .
12566,CONCLUSIONS,Screening strategies providing access and navigation to both tests may be more effective than preference-tailored approaches .
12567,CONCLUSIONS,"Preference tailoring in colorectal cancer screening strategies should be avoided if the objective is to maximize screening rates , although other factors ( e.g. , costs , necessary follow-up ) should also be considered ."
12568,BACKGROUND,"Appropriate sedation benefits patients by reducing the stress response , but it requires an appropriate method of assessment to adjust the dosage of sedatives ."

12749,CONCLUSIONS,"Professional breastfeeding telephone support provided early in the postnatal period , and continued for the first month postpartum , improves breastfeeding duration among first-time mothers ."
12750,CONCLUSIONS,"It is also possible that it was the continuing nature of the support that increased the effectiveness of the intervention , rather than the delivery of the support by telephone specifically ."
12751,BACKGROUND,Alcohol misuse among youth is a major public health concern and numbers of adolescents admitted to the emergency department for acute alcoholic intoxication in Germany are recently growing .
12752,BACKGROUND,The emergency setting offers an opportunity to reach at-risk alcohol consuming adolescents and provide brief interventions in a potential `` teachable moment '' .
12753,BACKGROUND,"However , studies on brief interventions targeting adolescents in emergency care are scarce and little is known about their effectiveness when delivered immediately following hospitalization for acute alcohol intoxication ."
12754,BACKGROUND,In this protocol we present the HaLT-Hamburg trial evaluating a brief motivational intervention for adolescents treated in the emergency department after an episode of acute alcoholic intoxication .
12755,METHODS,The trial design is a parallel two-arm cluster randomized-controlled trial with follow-up assessment after 3 and 6 months .
12756,METHODS,N = 312 participants aged 17 years and younger will be recruited Fridays to Sundays in 6 pediatric clinics over a period of 30 months .
12757,METHODS,Intervention condition is a manual-based brief motivational intervention with a telephone booster after 6 weeks and a manual-guided intervention for caregivers which will be compared to treatment as usual .
12758,METHODS,"Primary outcomes are reduction in binge drinking episodes , quantity of alcohol use on a typical drinking day and alcohol-related problems ."
12759,METHODS,Secondary outcome is further treatment seeking .
12760,METHODS,Linear mixed models adjusted for baseline differences will be conducted according to intention-to-treat ( ITT ) and completers ( per-protocol ) principles to examine intervention effects .
12761,METHODS,"We also examine quantitative and qualitative process data on feasibility , intervention delivery , implementation and receipt from intervention providers , receivers and regular emergency department staff ."
12762,CONCLUSIONS,The study has a number of strengths .
12763,CONCLUSIONS,"First , a rigorous evaluation of HaLT-Hamburg is timely because variations of the HaLT project are widely used in Germany ."
12764,CONCLUSIONS,"Second , prior research has not targeted adolescents in the presumed teachable moment following acute alcohol intoxication ."
12765,CONCLUSIONS,"Third , we included a comprehensive process evaluation to raise external validity ."
12766,CONCLUSIONS,"Fourth , the study involved important stakeholders from the start to set up organizational structures for implementation and maintaining project impact ."
12767,BACKGROUND,Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN31234060 ( April 30th 2012 ) .
12768,OBJECTIVE,Paclitaxel drug-eluting balloons ( pDEB ) could be an attractive option to minimise side branch ( SB ) restenosis in bifurcated coronary lesions .
12769,OBJECTIVE,We compared angiographic and clinical outcomes with pDEB plus bare metal stent ( BMS ) versus drug-eluting stents ( DES ) in de novo bifurcated lesions .
12770,RESULTS,This multicentre randomised trial included 108 patients .
12771,RESULTS,"Sequential main branch ( MB ) / SB dilatation with pDEB , with provisional T-stenting with BMS in the MB was performed in the pDEB group , and with everolimus DES in the DES group ."
12772,RESULTS,The primary endpoint was late lumen loss ( LLL ) at nine months .
12773,RESULTS,"The secondary endpoint was the incidence of major adverse cardiac events ( MACE : death , myocardial infarction , or target lesion revascularisation ) ."
12774,RESULTS,"In-segment MB LLL was 0.310.48 mm in the pDEB group , and 0.160.38 mm in the DES group ( p = 0.15 ) ; mean difference was 0.15 mm ( upper limit one-sided 95 % CI : 0.27 mm ; p = 0.001 ; non-inferiority test ) ."
12775,RESULTS,LLL in SB was -0.040.76 mm in the pDEB group and -0.030.51 mm in the DES group ( p = 0.983 ) .
12776,RESULTS,"MACE and TLR were higher in the pDEB group ( 17.3 % vs. 7.1 % ; p = 0.105 , and 15.4 % vs. 3.6 % ; p = 0.045 ) , due to higher MB restenosis ( 13.5 % vs. 1.8 % ; p = 0.027 ) ."
12777,CONCLUSIONS,pDEB bifurcation pretreatment with BMS implantation in MB showed greater LLL ( ns ) and increased incidence of MACE compared to everolimus DES .
12778,CONCLUSIONS,Both strategies showed similar results in the SB .
12779,BACKGROUND,"Women who deliver preterm infants are at a much greater risk for repeating a preterm birth ( PTB ) , compared to women without a history of PTB ."
12780,BACKGROUND,"However , little is known about the prevalence of the risk factors which account for this markedly increased risk ."
12781,BACKGROUND,"Moreover , little or nothing is known about the feasibility of providing treatments and services to these women , outside of the context of prenatal care , during the inter-conception period , which provides the best opportunity for successful risk-reduction interventions ."
12782,METHODS,"The Philadelphia Collaborative Preterm Prevention Project ( PCPPP ) , a large randomized control trial designed to identify and reduce six major risk factors for a repeat preterm birth among women immediately following the delivering of a preterm infant ."
12783,METHODS,"For the women assigned to the PCPPP treatment group , we calculated the prevalence of the six risk factors in question , the percentages of women who agreed to receive high quality risk-appropriate treatments or services , and the of rates of participation among those who were offered and eligible for these treatments or services ."
12784,RESULTS,"Urogenital tract infections were identified in 57 % of the women , while 59 % were found to have periodontal disease ."
12785,RESULTS,"More than 39 % were active smokers , and 17 % were assessed with clinical depression ."
12786,RESULTS,"Low literacy , and housing instability were identified in , 22 and 83 % of the study sample , respectively ."
12787,RESULTS,"Among women eligible for intervention , the percentages who accepted and at least minimally participated in treatment ranged from a low of 28 % for smoking , to a high of 85 % for urogenital tract infection ."
12788,RESULTS,Most PCPPP enrollees ( 57 % ) had three or more major risk factors .
12789,RESULTS,"Participation rates associated with the PCPPP treatments or services varied markedly , and were quite low in some cases , despite considerable efforts to reduce the barriers to receiving care ."
12790,CONCLUSIONS,The efficacy of individual level risk-reduction efforts designed to prevent preterm/repeat preterm in the pre - or inter-conception period may be limited if participation rates associated with interventions to reduce major risk factors for PTB are low .
12791,CONCLUSIONS,"Achieving adequate participation may require identifying , better understanding , and eliminating barriers to access , beyond those associated with cost , transportation , childcare , and service location or hours of operation ."

12793,OBJECTIVE,Myoelectric prostheses use electromyographic ( EMG ) signals to control movement of prosthetic joints .
12794,OBJECTIVE,"Clinically available myoelectric control strategies do not allow simultaneous movement of multiple degrees of freedom ( DOFs ) ; however , the use of implantable devices that record intramuscular EMG signals could overcome this constraint ."
12795,OBJECTIVE,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the real-time simultaneous control of three DOFs ( wrist rotation , wrist flexion/extension , and hand open/close ) using intramuscular EMG ."
12796,METHODS,"We evaluated task performance of five able-bodied subjects in a virtual environment using two control strategies with fine-wire EMG : ( i ) parallel dual-site differential control , which enabled simultaneous control of three DOFs and ( ii ) pattern recognition control , which required sequential control of DOFs ."
12797,RESULTS,"Over the course of the experiment , subjects using parallel dual-site control demonstrated increased use of simultaneous control and improved performance in a Fitts ' Law test ."
12798,RESULTS,"By the end of the experiment , performance using parallel dual-site control was significantly better ( up to a 25 % increase in throughput ) than when using sequential pattern recognition control for tasks requiring multiple DOFs ."
12799,RESULTS,The learning trends with parallel dual-site control suggested that further improvements in performance metrics were possible .
12800,RESULTS,Subjects occasionally experienced difficulty in performing isolated single-DOF movements with parallel dual-site control but were able to accomplish related Fitts ' Law tasks with high levels of path efficiency .
12801,CONCLUSIONS,"These results suggest that intramuscular EMG , used in a parallel dual-site configuration , can provide simultaneous control of a multi-DOF prosthetic wrist and hand and may outperform current methods that enforce sequential control ."
12802,OBJECTIVE,"To simultaneously examine the effects of acute exercise intensity and free-living physical activity and sedentary behavior on cognitive function in young , healthy adults ."
12803,METHODS,"Using a counterbalanced , crossover , randomized controlled design , 87 young adults ( mean age , 21.4 years ) completed various cognitive assessments with and without an acute bout of exercise preceding the assessment ."
12804,METHODS,"Participants were randomized into 1 of 4 groups to complete a 30-minute bout of acute exercise : control ( no exercise ) , light intensity ( 40 % -50 % of predicted maximum heart rate [ HR ( max ) ] ) , moderate intensity ( 51 % -70 % of predicted HR ( max ) ) , or vigorous intensity ( 71 % -85 % of predicted HR ( max ) ) ."
12805,METHODS,Subjectively and objectively determined ( accelerometry ) physical activity and sedentary behavior were assessed to examine the association between these free-living behaviors and cognitive function .
12806,METHODS,"The study duration was August 26 , 2013 , to September 11 , 2014 ."
12807,RESULTS,Concentration-related cognition ( mean SD Feature Match test score ) was significantly higher after a 30-minute acute bout of moderate-intensity exercise ( 145.126.9 ) compared with cognitive assessment without exercise ( 121.319.2 ; P = .004 ) .
12808,RESULTS,"Furthermore , questionnaire-determined sedentary behavior was inversely associated with visual attention and task switching ( Trail Making Test A score ) ( = -0.23 ; P = .04 ) ."
12809,RESULTS,"Last , estimated cardiorespiratory fitness ( volume of maximum oxygen consumption ) was positively associated with reasoning-related cognitive function ( Odd One Out test score ) ( = 0.49 ; P = .05 ) ; when adding metabolic equivalent of task minutes per week to this model , the results were not significant ( = 0.47 ; P = .07 ) ."
12810,CONCLUSIONS,"These findings provide some support for acute moderate-intensity exercise , sedentary behavior , and cardiorespiratory fitness being associated with executive functioning-related cognitive function in young , healthy adults ."
12811,OBJECTIVE,"The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of edivoxetine ( LY2216684 ) , a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor , in pediatric patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) ."
12812,METHODS,"A fixed-dose , randomized , double-blind , 8 week study was conducted in patients 6-17 years of age , who were randomized by two strata : 1 ) Patients with prior stimulant use randomized to placebo , edivoxetine 0.1 mg/kg/day , 0.2 mg/kg/day , or 0.3 mg/kg/day arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio ; 2 ) Stimulant-nave patients randomized to placebo , edivoxetine 0.1 mg/kg/day , 0.2 mg/kg/day , 0.3 mg/kg/day , or osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate ( OROS MPH ) ( 18-54mg / day based on body weight ) arms in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio ."
12813,METHODS,The primary efficacy measure was baseline-to-week 8 change of ADHD Rating Scale ( ADHD-RS ) total score for edivoxetine 0.2 mg/kg/day and 0.3 mg/kg/day .
12814,RESULTS,"A total of 340 patients were randomized to placebo ( n = 78 ) ; edivoxetine 0.1 mg/kg/day ( n = 76 ) , 0.2 mg/kg/day ( n = 75 ) , or 0.3 mg/kg/day ( n = 75 ) ; or OROS MPH ( n = 36 ) ."
12815,RESULTS,"In the stimulant-nave stratum , the positive control , OROS MPH , was significantly superior to placebo in mean ADHD-RS total score change at end-point ( -19.46 , p = 0.015 ) ."
12816,RESULTS,"The edivoxetine 0.2 mg/kg/day and 0.3 mg/kg/day arms had statistically significantly greater improvement than the placebo arm in mean ADHD-RS total score change at end-point ( placebo -10.35 ; edivoxetine 0.2 mg/kg/day -16.09 , p < 0.010 ; edivoxetine 0.3 mg/kg/day -16.39 , p < 0.010 ) and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score ( placebo 3.05 ; edivoxetine 0.1 mg/kg/day 3.01 , p = 0.860 ; edivoxetine 0.2 mg/kg/day 2.54 , p = 0.013 ; edivoxetine 0.3 mg/kg/day 2.53 , p = 0.013 ) ."
12817,RESULTS,"In the overall efficacy-analyses data set ( n = 270 ) , the effect size estimates for edivoxetine doses 0.1 mg/kg/day , 0.2 mg/kg/day and 0.3 mg/kg/day at the week 8 time point were 0.17 , 0.51 , and 0.54 , respectively ( for the stimulant-nave stratum , the effect size estimate for OROS MPH was 0.69 ) ."
12818,RESULTS,"Compared with placebo , edivoxetine treatment was associated with statistically significant increases in blood pressure and pulse ( p < 0.050 ) , and a smaller increase or slight decrease in weight ."
12819,CONCLUSIONS,"Edivoxetine at doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day and 0.3 mg/kg/day demonstrated efficacy in ADHD treatment , despite the presence of a sizeable placebo response ."

12822,OBJECTIVE,"To evaluate the relationship between number of metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) - like components and prostate cancer diagnosis in a group of men where nearly all biopsies were taken independent of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level , thus minimising any confounding from how the various MetS-like components may influence PSA levels ."
12823,METHODS,We analysed data from 6426 men in the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events ( REDUCE ) study with at least one on-study biopsy .
12824,METHODS,REDUCE compared dutasteride vs placebo on prostate cancer risk among men with an elevated PSA level and negative pre-study biopsy and included two on-study biopsies regardless of PSA level at 2 and 4 years .
12825,METHODS,"Available data for MetS-like components included data on diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolaemia , and body mass index ."
12826,METHODS,The association between number of these MetS-like components and prostate cancer risk and low-grade ( Gleason sum < 7 ) or high-grade ( Gleason sum > 7 ) vs no prostate cancer was evaluated using logistic regression .
12827,RESULTS,"In all , 2171 men ( 34 % ) had one MetS-like component , 724 ( 11 % ) had two , and 163 ( 3 % ) had three or four ."
12828,RESULTS,Men with more MetS-like components had lower PSA levels ( P = 0.029 ) .
12829,RESULTS,One vs no MetS-like components was protective for overall prostate cancer ( P = 0.041 ) and low-grade prostate cancer ( P = 0.010 ) .
12830,RESULTS,Two ( P = 0.69 ) or three to four ( P = 0.15 ) MetS-like components were not significantly related to prostate cancer .
12831,RESULTS,"While one MetS-like component was unrelated to high-grade prostate cancer ( P = 0.97 ) , two ( P = 0.059 ) or three to four MetS-like components ( P = 0.02 ) were associated with increased high-grade prostate cancer risk , although only the latter was significant ."
12832,CONCLUSIONS,"When biopsies are largely PSA level independent , men with an initial elevated PSA level and a previous negative biopsy , and multiple MetS-like components were at an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer , suggesting the link between MetS-like components and high-grade prostate cancer is unrelated to a lowered PSA level ."
12833,BACKGROUND,Qigong is highly favoured among Asian breast cancer survivors for enhancing health .
12834,BACKGROUND,This study examined the hypothesis that quality of life ( QoL ) in the Qigong group is better than the placebo ( aerobic ) or usual care group .
12835,METHODS,A total of 197 participants were randomly assigned to either the 8-week Kuala Lumpur Qigong Trial or control groups in 2010-2011 .
12836,METHODS,"Measurement taken at baseline and post - intervention included QoL , distress and fatigue ."
12837,METHODS,Analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) and Kruskal Wallis were used to examine for differences between groups in the measurements .
12838,RESULTS,There were 95 consenting participants in this 8week trial .
12839,RESULTS,The adherence rates were 63 % for Qigong and 65 % for the placebo group .
12840,RESULTS,"The Qigong group showed significant marginal improvement in Quality of life scores compared to placebo ( mean difference = 7.3 unit ; p = 0.036 ) , compared to usual care ( mean difference = 6.7 unit ; p = 0.048 ) on Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Breast measure ."
12841,RESULTS,There were no significant changes between the placebo and usual care groups in fatigue or distress at post intervention ( 8-week ) .
12842,CONCLUSIONS,Cancer survivors who participated in the Qigong intervention showed slightly better QOL .
12843,CONCLUSIONS,Follow up studies are greatly needed to evaluate which subgroups may best benefit from Qigong .
12844,CONCLUSIONS,"With a steep rise of cancer survivors , there is an urgent need to explore and engage more cultural means of physical activity to fight side effects of treatment and for cancer control in developing countries ."
12845,OBJECTIVE,"Our goal was to evaluate the effect of breakfast size and composition on body weight , glycemic control , and metabolic markers in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) ."
12846,METHODS,"59 overweight/obese adults with T2DM were randomized to one of two isocaloric diabetic diets for 3 months ; big breakfast ( BB ) , breakfast was rich in fat and protein and provided 33 % of total daily energy or small breakfast ( SB ) , breakfast was rich in carbohydrates and provided 12.5 % of total daily energy ."
12847,RESULTS,"Although body weight was reduced similarly in both groups , the BB group showed greater HbA1c and systolic blood pressure reductions ( HbA1c : -4.62 % vs. -1.46 % , p = 0.047 ; SBP -9.58 vs. -2.43 mmHg ; p = 0.04 ) ."
12848,RESULTS,"T2DM medication dose was reduced in a greater proportion of the BB participants ( 31 % vs. 0 % ; p = 0.002 ) while in the SB , a greater proportion of participants had a dose increases ( 16.7 % vs. 3.4 % ; p = 0.002 ) ."
12849,RESULTS,Hunger scores were lower in the BB group and greater improvements in fasting glucose were observed in the BB group .
12850,CONCLUSIONS,A simple dietary manipulation enriching breakfast with energy as protein and fat appears to confer metabolic benefits and might be a useful alternative for the management of T2DM .
12851,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the association between baseline comprehensive geriatric assessment ( CGA ) or the Groningen Frailty Indicator ( GFI ) and toxicity in elderly metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) patients treated with first-line palliative chemotherapy .
12852,METHODS,MBC patients ( 65 years ) were randomized between pegylated liposomal doxorubicine or capecitabine .
12853,METHODS,"CGA included instrumental activities of daily living ( IADL ) , cognition using the mini-mental state examination ( MMSE ) , mood using the geriatric depression scale ( GDS ) , comorbidity using the Charlson index , polypharmacy and nutritional status using the body mass index ."

12856,RESULTS,"Of the randomized 78 patients ( median age 75.5 years , range 65.8-86 .8 years ) , 73 were evaluable for CGA ; 52 ( 71 % ) had one or more geriatric conditions ."
12857,RESULTS,Grade 3-4 chemotherapy-related toxicity was experienced by 19 % of patients without geriatric conditions compared to 56 % of patients with two geriatric conditions and 80 % of those with three or more ( p = 0.002 ) .
12858,RESULTS,Polypharmacy was the only individual factor significantly associated with toxicity ( p = 0.001 ) .
12859,RESULTS,"GFI had a sensitivity of 69 % and a specificity of 76 % for frailty on CGA , and was not significantly associated with survival or toxicity ."
12860,CONCLUSIONS,"In this study of elderly patients with MBC , the number of geriatric conditions correlated with grade 3-4 chemotherapy-related toxicity ."
12861,CONCLUSIONS,"Therefore , in elderly patients for whom chemotherapy is being considered , a CGA could be a useful addition to the decision-making process ."
12862,BACKGROUND,Hereditary haemochromatosis may result in severe organ damage which can be prevented by therapy .
12863,BACKGROUND,We studied the possible advantages and disadvantages of erythrocytapheresis as compared with phlebotomy in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis .
12864,METHODS,"In a prospective , randomised , open-label study , patients with hereditary haemochromatosis were randomised to bi-weekly apheresis or weekly whole blood phlebotomy ."

12866,METHODS,"Secondary endpoints were decrease in haemoglobin levels , discomfort during the therapeutic procedure , costs and technicians ' working time ."
12867,RESULTS,Sixty-two patients were included .
12868,RESULTS,Thirty patients were randomised to apheresis and 32 to whole blood phlebotomy .
12869,RESULTS,"Initially , ferritin levels declined more rapidly in the apheresis group , and the difference became statistically highly significant at 11 weeks ; however , time to normalisation of ferritin level was equal in the two groups ."
12870,RESULTS,"We observed no significant differences in decline of transferrin saturation , haemoglobin levels or discomfort ."
12871,RESULTS,"The mean cumulative technician time consumption until the ferritin level reached 50 g/L was longer in the apheresis group , but the difference was not statistically significant ."
12872,RESULTS,The cumulative costs for materials until achievement of the desired ferritin levels were three-fold higher in the apheresis group .
12873,CONCLUSIONS,"Treatment of hereditary haemochromatosis with erythrocytapheresis instead of whole blood phlebotomy results in a more rapid initial decline in ferritin levels and a reduced number of procedures per patient , but not in earlier achievement of target ferritin level ."
12874,CONCLUSIONS,The frequency of discomfort was equally low with the two methods .
12875,CONCLUSIONS,"The costs and , probably , technician time consumption were higher in the apheresis group ."
12876,BACKGROUND,"SMOFlipid 20 % is intravenous lipid emulsion ( ILE ) containing long-chain triglycerides ( LCT ) , medium-chain triglycerides ( MCT ) , olive oil , and fish oil as a mixed emulsion containing - tocopherol ."
12877,BACKGROUND,The aim was to assess the efficacy of this new ILE in gastrointestinal surgery compared with MCT/LCT .
12878,METHODS,"In this prospective study , 40 patients were randomized to SMOFlipid 20 % or MCT/LCT ( Lipovenoes 20 % ) group ."
12879,METHODS,Clinical and biochemistry data were collected .
12880,METHODS,"Inflammatory markers ( CRP , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNF - , TGF-1 ) and oxidative stress ( ROS and superoxide ) were measured ."
12881,RESULTS,Thirty-five patients ( 17 males and 18 females ) with a mean age of 57 years completed the study .
12882,RESULTS,"The patients ' demographic characteristics ( age , gender , height , body weight , and BMI ) were similar without significant differences between groups ."
12883,RESULTS,The increment of triglyceride on day 6 from baseline was significantly lower in SMOFlipid group than in Lipovenoes MCT/LCT group .
12884,RESULTS,"Inflammatory markers , as well as superoxide radical and total oxygen radical were not different between groups ."
12885,CONCLUSIONS,"Despite the comparable effect on inflammatory response , because of its well-balanced fatty acid pattern , relatively low n-6 : n-3 ratio , and high vitamin E content , SMOFlipid had a better triglyceride-lowering effect as compared with MCT/LCT in adult patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery ."

12905,METHODS,"In the sedation group , 19 children , mean age 41.5 months , received intranasal Midazolam ( 0.5 mg/kg ) and Ketamine ( 2 mg/kg ) ."
12906,METHODS,"In the placebo group , 17 children received normal saline solution twice in each nostril ."
12907,METHODS,The child 's degree of sedation was scored using the MOPS .
12908,METHODS,A questionnaire was designed to evaluate the parents ' and doctors ' opinions on the procedures of both groups .
12909,RESULTS,"Fifty-seven gastric washings were performed in the sedation-group , while in the placebo-group we performed 51 gastric aspirates ."
12910,RESULTS,The degree of sedation achieved by INMK enabled all procedures to be completed without additional drugs .
12911,RESULTS,The mean duration of sedation was 71.5 min .
12912,RESULTS,"Mean MOPS was 3.5 ( range 1-8 ) in the sedation-group , 7.2 ( range 4-9 ) in the placebo-group ( p < 0.0001 ) ."
12913,RESULTS,The questionnaire revealed high levels of satisfaction by both doctors and parents in the sedation-group compared to the placebo-group .
12914,RESULTS,The only side effect registered was post-sedation agitation in 6 procedures in the sedation group ( 10.5 % ) .
12915,CONCLUSIONS,Our experience suggests that atomized INKM makes gastric aspirates more acceptable and easy to perform in children .

12917,OBJECTIVE,To determine the optimal method for use of the Canine Brief Pain Inventory ( CBPI ) to quantitate responses of dogs with osteoarthritis to treatment with carprofen or placebo .
12918,METHODS,150 dogs with osteoarthritis .
12919,METHODS,Data were analyzed from 2 studies with identical protocols in which owner-completed CBPIs were used .
12920,METHODS,Treatment for each dog was classified as a success or failure by comparing the pain severity score ( PSS ) and pain interference score ( PIS ) on day 0 ( baseline ) with those on day 14 .
12921,METHODS,"Treatment success or failure was defined on the basis of various combinations of reduction in the 2 scores when inclusion criteria were set as a PSS and PIS 1 , 2 , or 3 at baseline ."
12922,METHODS,Statistical analyses were performed to select the definition of treatment success that had the greatest statistical power to detect differences between carprofen and placebo treatments .
12923,RESULTS,Defining treatment success as a reduction of 1 in PSS and 2 in PIS in each dog had consistently robust power .
12924,RESULTS,Power was 62.8 % in the population that included only dogs with baseline scores 2 and 64.7 % in the population that included only dogs with baseline scores 3 .
12925,CONCLUSIONS,The CBPI had robust statistical power to evaluate the treatment effect of carprofen in dogs with osteoarthritis when protocol success criteria were predefined as a reduction 1 in PIS and 2 in PSS .
12926,CONCLUSIONS,Results indicated the CBPI can be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials to evaluate new pain treatments when it is desirable to evaluate success in individual dogs rather than overall mean or median scores in a test population .
12927,BACKGROUND,Two once-daily long-acting muscarinic antagonists ( LAMAs ) are currently available for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) - tiotropium and glycopyrronium .
12928,BACKGROUND,Previous studies have compared glycopyrronium with open-label tiotropium .
12929,BACKGROUND,"In the GLOW5 study , we compare glycopyrronium with blinded tiotropium ."
12930,METHODS,"In this blinded , double-dummy , parallel group , 12-week study , patients with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomized 1:1 to glycopyrronium 50 g once daily or tiotropium 18 g once daily ."
12931,METHODS,The primary objective was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of glycopyrronium versus blinded tiotropium with respect to trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) following 12 weeks of treatment ( non-inferiority margin : -50 mL ) .
12932,METHODS,"Secondary objectives were to evaluate glycopyrronium versus tiotropium for other spirometric outcomes , breathlessness ( Transition Dyspnea Index ; TDI ) , health status ( St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ; SGRQ ) , daily rescue medication use , COPD exacerbations and COPD symptoms over 12 weeks of treatment ."
12933,RESULTS,657 patients were randomized ( glycopyrronium : 327 ; tiotropium : 330 ) ; 96 % ( 630 patients ) completed the study .
12934,RESULTS,"Least squares mean trough FEV1 for both glycopyrronium and tiotropium was 1.405 L at Week 12 , meeting the criterion for non-inferiority ( mean treatment difference : 0 mL , 95 % CI : -32 , 31 mL ) ."
12935,RESULTS,"Glycopyrronium demonstrated rapid bronchodilation following first dose on Day 1 , with significantly higher FEV1 at all time points from 0-4 h post-dose versus tiotropium ( all p < 0.001 ) ."
12936,RESULTS,FEV1 area under the curve from 0-4 h ( AUC0-4h ) post-dose with glycopyrronium was significantly superior to tiotropium on Day 1 ( p < 0.001 ) and was comparable to tiotropium at Week 12 .
12937,RESULTS,"Glycopyrronium demonstrated comparable improvements to tiotropium in TDI focal score , SGRQ total score , rescue medication use and the rate of COPD exacerbations ( all p = not significant ) ."
12938,RESULTS,Patients on glycopyrronium also had a significantly lower total COPD symptom score versus patients on tiotropium after 12 weeks ( p = 0.035 ) .
12939,RESULTS,Adverse events were reported by a similar percentage of patients receiving glycopyrronium ( 40.4 % ) and tiotropium ( 40.6 % ) .
12940,CONCLUSIONS,"In patients with moderate-to-severe COPD , 12-week blinded treatment with once-daily glycopyrronium 50 g or tiotropium 18 g , provided similar efficacy and safety , with glycopyrronium having a faster onset of action on Day 1 versus tiotropium ."
12941,OBJECTIVE,To investigate the potential of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 inhibition as a novel mechanism to reduce edema and improve vision in center-involved diabetic macular edema ( DME ) .
12942,METHODS,"Prospective , multicenter , randomized , double-masked , placebo-controlled phase IIa study ."
12943,METHODS,Fifty-four center-involved DME patients randomized 2:1 to receive darapladib ( n = 36 ) or placebo ( n = 18 ) .
12944,METHODS,"Darapladib 160 mg or placebo monotherapy was administered orally once daily for 3 months , and patients were followed up monthly for 4 months ."
12945,METHODS,Mean change from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) and the center subfield and center point of the study eye at month 3 as determined by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography .
12946,RESULTS,"Five patients in the study received intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor rescue therapy before the day 90 assessment , 2 of 36 ( 6 % ) in the darapladib arm and 3 of 18 ( 17 % ) in the placebo arm ."
12947,RESULTS,"Administration of 160 mg darapladib for 3 months resulted in statistically significant mean improvements , from baseline to month 3 , in BCVA of 4.1 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) letters ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 2.3-5 .8 ) and of 57 m in central subfield thickness ( 95 % CI , -84 to -30 ) in the study eyes ."
12948,RESULTS,"An increase in BCVA of 1.7 ETDRS letters ( 95 % CI , -1.0 to 4.4 ) and a decrease in center subfield thickness of 34 m ( 95 % CI , -75 to 6.8 ) for the placebo group were not significant ."
12949,RESULTS,No ocular severe adverse events ( SAEs ) or SAEs considered related to darapladib were reported .
12950,RESULTS,"One SAE of myocardial infarction , not considered related to darapladib , was reported , and 1 SAE of severe diarrhea was reported in a placebo patient , subsequently withdrawn from the study ."
12951,RESULTS,Study eye ocular adverse events ( AEs ) and nonocular AEs were similar between treatment groups .
12952,CONCLUSIONS,Once-daily oral darapladib administered for 3 months demonstrated modest improvements in vision and macular edema that warrant additional investigation of this novel lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 inhibitory mechanism for the treatment of DME .
12953,OBJECTIVE,To characterize retinal metabolism during normoxia and hyperoxia in healthy subjects .
12954,METHODS,"Forty-six healthy subjects were included in the present study , and data of 41 subjects could be evaluated ."
12955,METHODS,"Retinal vessel diameters , as well as oxygen saturation in arteries and veins , were measured using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer ."
12956,METHODS,"In addition , retinal venous blood velocity was measured using bidirectional laser Doppler velocimetry , retinal blood flow was calculated , and oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures were measured from arterialized capillary blood from the earlobe ."
12957,METHODS,Measurements were done during normoxia and during 100 % oxygen breathing .
12958,RESULTS,"Systemic hyperoxia caused a significant decrease in retinal venous diameter ( -13.0 % 4.5 % ) and arterial diameter ( -12.1 % 4.0 % ) , in retinal blood velocity ( -43.4 % 7.7 % ) , and in retinal blood flow ( -57.0 % 5.7 % ) ( P < 0.001 for all ) ."
12959,RESULTS,"Oxygen saturation increased in retinal arteries ( +4.4 % 2.3 % ) and in retinal veins ( +19.6 % 6.2 % ) , but the arteriovenous oxygen content difference significantly decreased ( -29.4 % 19.5 % ) ( P < 0.001 for all ) ."
12960,RESULTS,Blood oxygen tension in arterialized blood showed a pronounced increase from 90.2 7.7 to 371.3 92.7 mm Hg ( P < 0.001 ) .
12961,RESULTS,Calculated oxygen extraction in the eye decreased by as much as 62.5 % 9.5 % ( P < 0.001 ) .
12962,CONCLUSIONS,"Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that during 100 % oxygen breathing a large amount of oxygen , consumed by the inner retina , comes from the choroid , which is supported by previous animal data ."
12963,CONCLUSIONS,Interpretation of oxygen saturation data in retinal arteries and veins without quantifying blood flow is difficult .

12965,BACKGROUND,Young people in sub-Saharan Africa are affected by the HIV pandemic to a greater extent than young people elsewhere and effective HIV-preventive intervention programmes are urgently needed .
12966,BACKGROUND,The present article presents the rationale behind an EU-funded research project ( PREPARE ) examining effects of community-based ( school delivered ) interventions conducted in four sites in sub-Saharan Africa .
12967,BACKGROUND,"One intervention focuses on changing beliefs and cognitions related to sexual practices ( Mankweng , Limpopo , South Africa ) ."
12968,BACKGROUND,"Another promotes improved parent-offspring communication on sexuality ( Kampala , Uganda ) ."
12969,BACKGROUND,Two further interventions are more comprehensive aiming to promote healthy sexual practices .
12970,BACKGROUND,"One of these ( Western Cape , South Africa ) also aims to reduce intimate partner violence while the other ( Dar es Salaam , Tanzania ) utilises school-based peer education ."
12971,METHODS,A modified Intervention Mapping approach is used to develop all programmes .
12972,METHODS,Cluster randomised controlled trials of programmes delivered to school students aged 12-14 will be conducted in each study site .
12973,METHODS,Schools will be randomly allocated ( after matching or stratification ) to intervention and delayed intervention arms .
12974,METHODS,Baseline surveys at each site are followed by interventions and then by one ( Kampala and Limpopo ) or two ( Western Cape and Dar es Salaam ) post-intervention data collections .
12975,METHODS,Questionnaires include questions common for all sites and are partly based on a set of social cognition models previously applied to the study of HIV-preventive behaviours .
12976,METHODS,Data from all sites will be merged in order to compare prevalence and associations across sites on core variables .
12977,METHODS,Power is set to .80 or higher and significance level to .05 or lower in order to detect intervention effects .
12978,METHODS,Intraclass correlations will be estimated from previous surveys carried out at each site .
12979,CONCLUSIONS,We expect PREPARE interventions to have an impact on hypothesized determinants of risky sexual behaviour and in Western Cape and Dar es Salaam to change sexual practices .
12980,CONCLUSIONS,Results from PREPARE will ( i ) identify modifiable cognitions and social processes related to risky sexual behaviour and ( ii ) identify promising intervention approaches among young adolescents in sub-Saharan cultures and contexts .

12982,BACKGROUND,"Though topical corticosteroids ( TC ) are used for treating atopic dermatitis ( AD ) as a standard , there exist several problems including topical steroid addiction ( TSA ) or Red skin syndrome ."
12983,BACKGROUND,"Moreover , the number of patients , who refrain from using TC because of steroid-phobia , is increasing ."
12984,BACKGROUND,"Recently , topical PPAR alpha ligand application has been reported to improve experimental allergic dermatitis ."
12985,BACKGROUND,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term efficacy and safety of topical clofibrate , one of PPAR alpha ligand , in such steroid-phobic patients with AD ."
12986,METHODS,This study was conducted as a double-blind design to investigate the effects of random administration of topical clofibrate and base ( placebo ) on skin manifestation and blood parameters of patients for 2 weeks .
12987,METHODS,Severity was digitized using severity scoring systems for atopic dermatitis by the Japanese Dermatological Association ( SSS-JDA ) before and after two weeks .
12988,METHODS,Subjective severity of patients was evaluated using visual analog scale ( Pt-VAS ) .
12989,METHODS,Serum thymus and activation-regulated chemokine ( TARC ) and immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) were also investigated .
12990,RESULTS,"Twenty patients were enrolled , and 19 of 20 patients completed the study ."
12991,RESULTS,"In 19 patients , the value of severity score using SSS-JDA was decreased significantly after administration of topical clofibrate ( P = 0.001 ) ."
12992,RESULTS,Subjective evaluation using Pt-VAS ( P = 0.008 ) and serum TARC levels ( P = 0.03 ) were also significantly decreased after two weeks of topical clofibrate .
12993,RESULTS,There was not a significant difference in serum IgE levels .
12994,RESULTS,No adverse effect was observed .
12995,CONCLUSIONS,Topical clofibrate is useful for patients with AD especially who are reluctant to use topical steroids .
12996,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the effects of single doses of gabapentin 250 and 500 mg on polysomnographic ( PSG ) and participant-reported sleep measures in a 5-h phase advance insomnia model .
12997,METHODS,"Adults reporting occasional disturbed sleep received gabapentin 500 mg ( n = 125 ) , 250 mg ( n = 125 ) , or placebo ( n = 127 ) 30 min prior to bedtime and were in bed from 17:00 to 01:00 , 5 h before their habitual bedtime ."
12998,METHODS,"Sleep was assessed by PSG , post-sleep questionnaire , and the Karolinska Sleep Diary ( KSD ) ."
12999,METHODS,Next-day residual effects ( Digit Symbol Substitution Test [ DSST ] and Stanford Sleepiness Scale [ SSS ] ) and tolerability were assessed .
13000,RESULTS,Demographics were comparable among groups .
13001,RESULTS,"Among PSG endpoints , wake after sleep onset ( primary endpoint ) ( 135.7 [ placebo ] , 100.7 [ 250 mg ] , and 73.2 [ 500 mg ] min ) was significantly lower and total sleep time ( TST ) ( 311.4 , 356.5 , and 378.7 min ) significantly greater in both gabapentin groups versus placebo ."
13002,RESULTS,Latency to persistent sleep was not significantly different among groups .
13003,RESULTS,"Percent slow wave sleep ( 12.6 % , 15.4 % , and 17.0 % , respectively ) was significantly greater and percent stage 1 ( 15.1 % , 11.8 % , and 10.8 % , respectively ) significantly lower relative to placebo ."
13004,RESULTS,Gabapentin was associated with significantly higher values of KSD Sleep Quality Index and reported TST versus placebo ; no other reported outcomes were significant .
13005,RESULTS,Neither gabapentin dose produced evidence of next-day residual effects as measured by DSST and SSS .
13006,RESULTS,Adverse events were infrequent ( < 5 % ) .
13007,CONCLUSIONS,Participants with occasional disturbed sleep treated with gabapentin showed significantly longer sleep duration and greater depth ( versus placebo ) in response to a phase advance manipulation known to disrupt sleep maintenance .
13008,BACKGROUND,The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy ( STPP ) in comparison with treatment as usual ( TAU ) in treatment of patients suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders .
13009,METHODS,"Sixty patients were recruited from the Psychotherapy Service , University of Milan , Department of Psychiatry , at Milan 's IRCCS Foundation Ca ' Granda , Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico with the diagnosis of depressive or anxiety disorders according to DSM-IV-TR criteria ."
13010,METHODS,These subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to an intervention group ( STPP ) or control group ( TAU ) for 12 months ( T1 ) .
13011,METHODS,"Each patient was clinically evaluated at the moment of recruitment ( T0 ) and after 12 months using a battery composed of these scales : Clinical Global Impression Scale ( CGI ) , Symptom Checklist-90-Revised ( SCL-90-R ) , Inventory of Interpersonal Problems ( IIP ) ."
13012,RESULTS,Statistical analysis highlighted significant improvements ( p < 0.05 ) for the group treated with STPP in every clinical scale .
13013,RESULTS,Instead control group revealed significant changes ( p < 0.05 ) only for SCL-90 scale scores .
13014,RESULTS,"We noticed a clinical improvement in both groups without particular differences , but the IIP scores went through a significant higher enhancement only in STPP group ."
13015,CONCLUSIONS,Our results suggest that STPP is so effective as TAU in treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders .
13016,CONCLUSIONS,Moreover STPP leads to a better recover of relational functioning .
13017,BACKGROUND,"Carotid artery stenting ( CAS ) is a worldwide diffuse intervention , but may be associated with distal plaque component embolization , and sometimes major and minor stroke ."
13018,BACKGROUND,"Statin use has been demonstrated to reduce atherosclerotic plaque burden , but its effect in reducing distal embolization during carotid stenting has not yet been well validated ."
13019,OBJECTIVE,"With the Rosuvastatin Pretreatment to Reduce Embolization during Carotid Artery Stenting trial , we aim to discover if a pretreatement with high doses of rosuvastatin in dyslipidemic patients is able to reduce periprocedural cerebral ischemic complications following carotid stenting ."

13025,METHODS,"In order to obtain the expected superiority of statin pretreatment on primary end point , a population of 130 patients will be enrolled into the study ."
13026,CONCLUSIONS,"In conclusion , with the Rosuvastatin Pretreatment to Reduce Embolization during Carotid Artery Stenting trial , we want to evaluate whether a high dose of rosuvastatin for 6 weeks before CAS in asymptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis is able to reduce the rate of plaque embolization during the procedure , thus suggesting a possible reduction in cerebral ischemic complications ."
13027,BACKGROUND,"Among the various factors influencing the success rate , onset time , and duration of peripheral nerve blocks , the role of local anesthetics concentration remains uncertain ."
13028,BACKGROUND,"In this prospective , randomized , single-blinded study , we evaluated whether varying the dilution of a fixed dose of mepivacaine solution influenced onset time and duration of sciatic nerve block ."
13029,METHODS,Ninety ASA physical status I to II patients scheduled for foot surgery were randomly allocated to receive a double-injection Labat sciatic nerve block with 12 mL mepivacaine 2 % ( group concentration I = 45 patients ) or 24 mL of mepivacaine 1 % ( group volume II = 45 patients ) .
13030,METHODS,"The nerve stimulator was initially set at 2 Hz , 0.1 millisecond , 1 mA ."
13031,METHODS,The total amount of local anesthetic ( 240 mg ) was kept constant and equally divided between the peroneal and tibial nerves .
13032,METHODS,All patients also received an ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic nerve catheter for postoperative analgesia .
13033,METHODS,"Times to readiness for surgery , performance , and offset of local anesthetic were recorded ."
13034,METHODS,Our primary end point was to determine a possible difference in offset time between groups .
13035,METHODS,Continuous variables were expressed as median ( IQR ) and compared with the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test ; WMWodds are reported together with their 95 % confidence interval .
13036,RESULTS,The overall success rate of sciatic nerve block was 99 % .
13037,RESULTS,"Time of performance was shorter in group I , 120 seconds ( 90-150 seconds ) , than that in group II , 150 seconds ( 120-180 seconds ) ( P = 0.0048 ; WMWodds 2.26 [ 1.35-4 .34 ] ) ."
13038,RESULTS,"The onset time of sensory and motor sciatic nerve block was 4 minutes ( 2-9 minutes ) in group I and 6 minutes ( 4-10 minutes ) in group II ( P = 0.41 ; WMWodds 1.21 [ 0.77-1 .95 ] ) , while the duration of sensory block was 235 minutes ( 203-250 minutes ) in group I , and 240 minutes ( 218-247 minutes ) in group II respectively ( P = 0.51 ; WMWodds 1.20 [ 0.69-2 .16 ] ) ."
13039,CONCLUSIONS,We found no evidence that varying volume and concentration while maintaining a fixed total dose of mepivacaine alters the onset time and duration of double-injection sciatic nerve block .
13040,CONCLUSIONS,"Considering our WMWodds results , possible differences in onset time and duration comparable to differences in the performance time between groups can not be excluded ."

13083,RESULTS,No differences per gender were observed in the Heart Age group .
13084,CONCLUSIONS,Informing patients about their CVD risk expressed as the new Heart Age tool results in a reduction in their CVD risk higher than the one observed when the Framingham REGICOR risk score was used .
13085,OBJECTIVE,Tonsillectomy is one of the most common pediatric surgical procedures performed in the United States .
13086,OBJECTIVE,"The postoperative period can be particularly painful , and there is currently no consensus on an optimal analgesic regimen ."
13087,OBJECTIVE,The objective of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of the single drug tramadol versus codeine/acetaminophen post-tonsillectomy .
13088,METHODS,"Prospective , double-blinded , randomized controlled trial ."
13089,METHODS,"Large , Midwestern US pediatric hospital ."
13090,METHODS,Eighty-four children aged 4-15 years who underwent a tonsillectomy ( with or without adenoidectomy ) procedure were randomized and 74 were included in the analysis .
13091,METHODS,"Group 1 received liquid codeine/acetaminophen for 10 days post-tonsillectomy ( 5 days scheduled , followed by 5 days as-needed ) ."
13092,METHODS,"Group 2 received liquid tramadol for 10 days post-tonsillectomy ( 5 days scheduled , followed by 5 days as-needed ) ."

13094,RESULTS,Children in both study arms reported adequate post-tonsillectomy pain management without significant differences between groups in pain scores .
13095,RESULTS,"Oversedation was significantly higher on the day of surgery in the codeine/acetaminophen group , and itching was experienced by significantly more children in the tramadol group during the postoperative period ."
13096,CONCLUSIONS,"As part of multimodal analgesia , scheduled plus as-needed tramadol may be considered for children in the postoperative setting due to its analgesic properties , low potential for side effects , and good safety profile ."
13097,OBJECTIVE,Thirty-six months of isoniazid preventive therapy ( 36IPT ) was superior to 6 months of IPT ( 6IPT ) in preventing tuberculosis ( TB ) among HIV-infected adults in Botswana .
13098,OBJECTIVE,We assessed the posttrial durability of this benefit .
13099,METHODS,A 36-month double-blind placebo controlled trial ( 1:1 randomization ) with recruitment between November 2004 and July 2006 and observation until June 2011 .
13100,METHODS,"One thousand , nine hundred and ninety-five participants were followed in eight public health clinics ."
13101,METHODS,Twenty-four percent had a tuberculin skin test 5mm ( TST-positive ) .
13102,METHODS,A minimum CD4 lymphocyte count was not required for enrolment .
13103,METHODS,Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) was provided in accordance with Botswana guidelines ; 72 % of participants retained by June 2011 had initiated ART .
13104,METHODS,"Multivariable analysis using Cox regression analysis included treatment arm , TST status , ART as a time-dependent variable and CD4 cell count at baseline and updated at 36 months ."
13105,RESULTS,"In the posttrial period , 2.13 and 2.14 per 100 person-years accumulated , whereas 0.93 and 1.13 % TB incidence rates were observed in the 36IPT and 6IPT arms , respectively ( P = 0.52 ) ."
13106,RESULTS,"The crude hazard ratio of TB during the trial and posttrial was 0.57 [ 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) 0.33 , 0.99 ] and 0.82 ( 95 % CI 0.46 , 1.49 ) , and when restricted to TST-positive participants was 0.26 ( 95 % CI 0.08 , 0.80 ) and 0.40 ( 95 % CI 0.15 , 1.08 ) , respectively ."
13107,RESULTS,"Multivariable analysis showed that ART use was associated with reduced death ( adjusted hazard ratio 0.36 , 95 % CI 0.17-0 .75 ) but not TB ( 0.92 , 95 % CI 0.55-1 .53 ) in the posttrial period ."
13108,CONCLUSIONS,The benefit of 36IPT for TB prevention declined posttrial in this cohort .
13109,CONCLUSIONS,Adjunctive measures are warranted to prevent TB among HIV-infected persons receiving long-term ART in TB-endemic settings .

13122,BACKGROUND,NCT01420159 .
13123,BACKGROUND,Research has shown that paranoia may directly build on negative ideas about the self .
13124,BACKGROUND,Feeling inferior can lead to ideas of vulnerability .
13125,BACKGROUND,The clinical prediction is that decreasing negative self cognitions will reduce paranoia .
13126,METHODS,Thirty patients with persistent persecutory delusions were randomised to receive brief CBT in addition to standard care or to standard care ( ISRCTN06118265 ) .
13127,METHODS,"The six session intervention was designed to decrease negative , and increase positive , self cognitions ."
13128,METHODS,"Assessments at baseline , 8 weeks ( posttreatment ) and 12 weeks were carried out by a rater blind to allocation ."
13129,METHODS,The primary outcomes were posttreatment scores for negative self beliefs and paranoia .
13130,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes were psychological well-being , positive beliefs about the self , persecutory delusions , social comparison , self-esteem , anxiety , and depression ."
13131,RESULTS,Trial recruitment and retention were feasible and the intervention highly acceptable to the patients .
13132,RESULTS,All patients provided follow-up data .
13133,RESULTS,"Posttreatment there was a small reduction in negative self beliefs ( Cohen 's d = 0.24 ) and a moderate reduction in paranoia ( d = 0.59 ) , but these were not statistically significant ."
13134,RESULTS,"There were statistically significant improvements in psychological well-being ( d = 1.16 ) , positive beliefs about the self ( d = 1.00 ) , negative social comparison ( d = 0.88 ) , self-esteem ( d = 0.62 ) , and depression ( d = 0.68 ) ."
13135,RESULTS,No improvements were maintained .
13136,RESULTS,No adverse events were associated with the intervention .
13137,CONCLUSIONS,The intervention produced short-term gains consistent with the prediction that improving cognitions about the self will reduce persecutory delusions .
13138,CONCLUSIONS,The improvement in psychological well-being is important in its own right .
13139,CONCLUSIONS,We recommend that the different elements of the intervention are tested separately and that the treatment is lengthened .
13140,BACKGROUND,Tissue oxygenation is a strong predictor of surgical site infection .
13141,BACKGROUND,Improving tissue oxygenation should thus reduce wound infection risk .
13142,BACKGROUND,"Supplemental inspired oxygen can improve tissue oxygenation , but whether it reduces infection risk remains controversial ."
13143,BACKGROUND,"Low-dose dexamethasone is often given to reduce the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting , but steroid-induced immunosuppression can increase infection risk ."
13144,BACKGROUND,We therefore tested the hypotheses that supplemental perioperative oxygen reduces infection risk and that dexamethasone increases it .
13145,METHODS,"Using a factorial design , patients having colorectal resections expected to last 2 h were randomly assigned to 30 % ( n = 270 ) or 80 % ( n = 285 ) inspired oxygen during and for 1 h after surgery , and to 4 mg intraoperative dexamethasone ( n = 283 ) or placebo ( n = 272 ) ."
13146,METHODS,"Physicians blinded to group assignments evaluated wounds postoperatively , using US Centers for Disease Control criteria ."
13147,RESULTS,Subject and surgical characteristics were similar among study groups .
13148,RESULTS,"Surgical site infection incidence was similar among groups : 30 % oxygen 15.6 % , 80 % oxygen 15.8 % ( P = 1.00 ) ; dexamethasone 15.9 % , placebo 15.4 % , ( P = 0.91 ) ."
13149,CONCLUSIONS,Supplemental oxygen did not reduce surgical site infection risk .
13150,CONCLUSIONS,The preponderance of clinical evidence suggests that administration of 80 % supplemental inspired oxygen does not reduce infection risk .
13151,CONCLUSIONS,"We did not observe an increased risk of surgical site infection with the use of a single low dose of dexamethasone , indicating that it can be used for nausea and vomiting prophylaxis without promoting wound infections ."

13153,BACKGROUND,Mental practice using motor imagery of limb movement may facilitate motor recovery in persons who have experienced cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) .
13154,BACKGROUND,"However , the lack of a feedback mechanism that can monitor the quality of the motor imagery affects patients ' engagement and motivation to participate in the mental practice training program ."
13155,OBJECTIVE,This study investigates the effect of novel real-time motor imagery-associated cortical activity feedback on motor imagery-based mental practice training .
13156,METHODS,Ten healthy volunteers were randomly assigned into intervention and control groups .
13157,METHODS,Both groups participated in a five-visit motor imagery-based mental practice training program managed over a period of two months .
13158,METHODS,"The intervention group received mental practice training with real-time feedback of movement-associated cortical activity-beta band ( 16-28 Hz ) event-related desynchronization ( ERD ) in electroencephalography ( EEG ) , using a novel custom-made brain-computer interface ( BCI ) system ."
13159,METHODS,The control group received the mental practice training program without EEG cortical feedback .
13160,METHODS,Motor excitability was assessed by measuring the frequency power magnitude of the EEG rhythmic activity associated with physical execution of wrist extension before and after the motor imagery-based mental practice training .
13161,RESULTS,"The EEG frequency power magnitude associated with the physical execution of wrist extension was significantly lower ( i.e. more desynchronized ) after the mental practice training in the intervention group that received real-time cortical feedback ( P < 0.05 ) , whereas no significant difference in EEG frequency power magnitude associated with the physical execution of wrist extension was observed before and after mental practice training in the control group who did not receive feedback ."
13162,CONCLUSIONS,The mental practice training program with motor imagery-associated cortical feedback facilitated motor excitability during the production of voluntary motor control .
13163,CONCLUSIONS,"Motor imagery-based mental practice training with movement-associated cortical activity feedback may provide an effective strategy to facilitate motor recovery in brain injury patients , particularly during the early rehabilitation stage when full participation in physical and occupational therapy programs may not be possible due to excessive motor weakness ."
13164,OBJECTIVE,To assess whether buccal misoprostol is effective for the treatment of intrauterine fetal death .
13165,METHODS,This double-blind randomized trial was conducted at five tertiary-level hospitals in the United States and Vietnam .
13166,METHODS,One hundred fifty-three women with an intrauterine fetal death at 14-28 weeks of pregnancy received either 100 mcg buccal misoprostol or 200 mcg buccal misoprostol every 6 h for a maximum of 8 doses .
13167,METHODS,The main outcome measure was the fetal-placental delivery rate within 48 hours of prostaglandin commencement without any additional intervention .
13168,RESULTS,Most of the women ( 140/153 ) were recruited at the study site in Vietnam .
13169,RESULTS,Expulsion of both fetus and placenta within 48 hours of prostaglandin commencement without any additional interventions occurred in 61.8 % ( 47/76 ) of women receiving misoprostol 100 mcg and 77.9 % ( 60/77 ) of women receiving misoprostol 200 mcg .
13170,RESULTS,The 200 mcg dose was significantly more effective than the 100 mcg dose at expelling the fetus and placenta within 48 h [ RR 0.68 ( 95 % CI : 0.50-0 .92 ; p = .03 ) ] .
13171,RESULTS,The mean time to expulsion was significantly shorter using the 200 mcg dose ( 18.511.9 h ) than the 100 mcg dose ( 23.912.5 h ) ( p = .02 ) .
13172,RESULTS,Most women in both groups found the procedure satisfactory or very satisfactory ( 100 mcg : 76.7 % ( 56/73 ) ; 200 mcg : 89.5 % ( 68/76 ) [ RR 0.86 ( 95 % CI : 0.74-1 .00 ) ] .
13173,CONCLUSIONS,Buccal misoprostol is an effective method for medical induction of labor after intrauterine fetal demise .
13174,CONCLUSIONS,A 200 mcg dose is significantly more effective than 100 mcg for evacuating the uterus within 48h .
13175,CONCLUSIONS,The treatment is highly acceptable to women .
13176,CONCLUSIONS,Administration of 200 mcg buccal misoprostol every six hours is an effective and acceptable method to effect the delivery of a demised fetus at 14-28 weeks that can be feasibly implemented in a wide variety of settings .
13177,BACKGROUND,"Obesity and obstructive sleep apnea tend to coexist and are associated with inflammation , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , and high blood pressure , but their causal relation to these abnormalities is unclear ."
13178,METHODS,"We randomly assigned 181 patients with obesity , moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea , and serum levels of C-reactive protein ( CRP ) greater than 1.0 mg per liter to receive treatment with continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , a weight-loss intervention , or CPAP plus a weight-loss intervention for 24 weeks ."
13179,METHODS,"We assessed the incremental effect of the combined interventions over each one alone on the CRP level ( the primary end point ) , insulin sensitivity , lipid levels , and blood pressure ."
13180,RESULTS,"Among the 146 participants for whom there were follow-up data , those assigned to weight loss only and those assigned to the combined interventions had reductions in CRP levels , insulin resistance , and serum triglyceride levels ."
13181,RESULTS,None of these changes were observed in the group receiving CPAP alone .
13182,RESULTS,Blood pressure was reduced in all three groups .
13183,RESULTS,No significant incremental effect on CRP levels was found for the combined interventions as compared with either weight loss or CPAP alone .
13184,RESULTS,"Reductions in insulin resistance and serum triglyceride levels were greater in the combined-intervention group than in the group receiving CPAP only , but there were no significant differences in these values between the combined-intervention group and the weight-loss group ."
13185,RESULTS,"In per-protocol analyses , which included 90 participants who met prespecified criteria for adherence , the combined interventions resulted in a larger reduction in systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure than did either CPAP or weight loss alone ."
13186,CONCLUSIONS,"In adults with obesity and obstructive sleep apnea , CPAP combined with a weight-loss intervention did not reduce CRP levels more than either intervention alone ."
13187,CONCLUSIONS,"In secondary analyses , weight loss provided an incremental reduction in insulin resistance and serum triglyceride levels when combined with CPAP ."
13188,CONCLUSIONS,"In addition , adherence to a regimen of weight loss and CPAP may result in incremental reductions in blood pressure as compared with either intervention alone ."

13190,BACKGROUND,Circumcision and lower human papillomavirus ( HPV ) viral loads in men are possibly associated with a reduced risk of HPV transmission to women .
13191,BACKGROUND,"However , the association between male circumcision and HPV viral load remains unclear ."
13192,METHODS,"Swab specimens from the glans and shaft of the penis were collected from men enrolled in a circumcision trial in Kisumu , Kenya ."
13193,METHODS,GP5 + / 6 + polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) was used to identify HPV DNA types .
13194,METHODS,HPV-16 and HPV-18 loads were measured with a LightCycler real-time PCR and classified as high ( > 250 copies/scrape ) or low ( 250 copies/scrape ) .
13195,RESULTS,"A total of 1159 men were randomly assigned to undergo immediate circumcision , and 1140 men were randomly assigned to the control arm ( these individuals were asked to remain uncircumcised until the study ended ) ."
13196,RESULTS,"The hazard of acquisition of high-viral load infections in the glans was lower in the circumcision arm , compared with the control arm , for HPV-16 ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.32 [ 95 % confidence interval { CI } , .20 -.49 ] ) and HPV-18 ( HR , 0.34 [ 95 % CI , .21 -.54 ] ) ."
13197,RESULTS,"The 6-month risk of HPV persistence among men with high-viral load infections in the glans at baseline was lower in the circumcision arm , compared with the control arm , for HPV-16 ( risk ratio [ RR ] , 0.36 [ 95 % CI , .18 -.72 ] ) and HPV-18 ( RR 0.34 [ 95 % CI , .13 -.86 ] ) ."
13198,RESULTS,Weaker and less precise results were obtained for shaft samples .
13199,CONCLUSIONS,"Male circumcision could potentially reduce the risk of HPV transmission to women by reducing the hazard of acquisition , and the risk of persistence of high-HPV viral load infections in the glans in men ."
13200,OBJECTIVE,"Previous cell-based and animal studies showed mixed tocotrienols are neuroprotective , but the effect is yet to be proven in humans ."
13201,OBJECTIVE,"Thus , the present study aimed to evaluate the protective activity of mixed tocotrienols in humans with white matter lesions ( WMLs ) ."
13202,OBJECTIVE,"WMLs are regarded as manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease , reflecting varying degrees of neurodegeneration and tissue damage with potential as a surrogate end point in clinical trials ."
13203,METHODS,A total of 121 volunteers aged 35 years with cardiovascular risk factors and MRI-confirmed WMLs were randomized to receive 200 mg mixed tocotrienols or placebo twice a day for 2 years .
13204,METHODS,"The WML volumes were measured from MRI images taken at baseline , 1 year , and 2 years using a validated software and were compared ."
13205,METHODS,Fasting blood samples were collected for full blood chemistry investigation .
13206,RESULTS,"According to per-protocol ( 88 volunteers ) and intention-to-treat ( 121 volunteers ) analyses , the mean WML volume of the placebo group increased after 2 years , whereas that of the tocotrienol-supplemented group remained essentially unchanged ."
13207,RESULTS,The mean WML volume change between the 2 groups was not significantly different ( P = 0.150 ) at the end of 1 year but was significant at the end of 2 years for both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses ( P = 0.019 and P = 0.018 ) .
13208,RESULTS,No significant difference was observed in the blood chemistry parameters between the 2 groups .
13209,CONCLUSIONS,Mixed tocotrienols were found to attenuate the progression of WMLs .

13213,BACKGROUND,"Fimasartan is mainly eliminated via biliary excretion , and its urinary elimination is less than 3 % ."
13214,OBJECTIVE,"Based on guidance from the United States Food and Drug Administration , a reduced pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study was conducted to evaluate the effect of renal function on the PK of fimasartan in patients with renal impairment and healthy volunteers ."
13215,METHODS,"A single centre , single-dose , open-label , healthy volunteer controlled trial was conducted in patients with renal impairment ( RI ) ( estimated glomerular filtration rate lower than 30 mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) ) and age - , weight - and sex-matched healthy volunteers ( estimated glomerular filtration rate higher than 90 mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) ) ."
13216,METHODS,"All participants received a single oral dose of fimasartan 120 mg , after which serial blood sampling for PK evaluation was conducted ."
13217,METHODS,Noncompartmental PK analysis of fimasartan was performed .
13218,METHODS,A mixed-effects model approach was used to identify significant covariates and PK parameters .
13219,RESULTS,Sixteen subjects were enrolled ( 8 healthy volunteers and 8 RI patients ) .
13220,RESULTS,"The maximum plasma concentrations and areas under the plasma concentration curves of the RI patients were higher than those of the healthy volunteers , with geometric mean ratios of 1.87 and 1.73 , respectively ."
13221,RESULTS,The relative bioavailability of fimasartan from the population PK analysis was 77 % higher in the RI patients than in the healthy volunteers .
13222,CONCLUSIONS,The increased drug exposure of fimasartan in RI patients was explained by the increased relative bioavailability .
13223,CONCLUSIONS,This result can be explained from our knowledge concerning alterations in PK related to renal function .

13242,RESULTS,The percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher among the Lp-PLA2 ( F/F ) macrophages compared with that observed in the Lp-PLA2 ( V/V ) macrophages .
13243,RESULTS,This induction of apoptosis was independent of the actions of acetylated low-density lipoproteins .
13244,RESULTS,"In addition , the transfection of the expression plasmid of V279F mutant Lp-PLA2 into Cos-7 cells or monocyte/macrophage-like U937 cells promoted apoptosis ."
13245,RESULTS,The knockdown of Lp-PLA2 also increased the number of apoptotic cells .
13246,RESULTS,"Among the cells expressing mutant Lp-PLA2 , the caspase-7 activity was increased , while the activated Akt level was decreased ."
13247,CONCLUSIONS,The V279F mutation of Lp-PLA2 positively regulates the induction of apoptosis in macrophages and Cos-7 cells .
13248,CONCLUSIONS,An increase in the caspase-7 activity and a reduction in the activated Akt level are likely to be involved in this phenomenon .

13273,OBJECTIVE,The aim of the article is to determine whether maternal body mass index ( BMI ) influences the beneficial effects of diabetes treatment in women with gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) .
13274,METHODS,Secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized treatment trial of women with GDM .
13275,METHODS,"Outcomes of interest were elevated umbilical cord c-peptide levels ( > 90th percentile 1.77 ng/mL ) , large for gestational age ( LGA ) birth weight ( > 90th percentile ) , and neonatal fat mass ( g ) ."
13276,METHODS,"Women were grouped into five BMI categories adapted from the World Health Organization International Classification of normal , overweight , and obese adults ."
13277,METHODS,Outcomes were analyzed according to treatment group assignment .
13278,RESULTS,A total of 958 women were enrolled ( 485 treated and 473 controls ) .
13279,RESULTS,Maternal BMI at enrollment was not related to umbilical cord c-peptide levels .
13280,RESULTS,"However , treatment of women in the overweight , Class I , and Class II obese categories was associated with a reduction in both LGA birth weight and neonatal fat mass ."
13281,RESULTS,Neither measure of excess fetal growth was reduced with treatment in normal weight ( BMI < 25 kg/m ( 2 ) ) or Class III ( BMI40 kg/m ( 2 ) ) obese women .
13282,CONCLUSIONS,There was a beneficial effect of treatment on fetal growth in women with mild GDM who were overweight or Class I and Class II obese .
13283,CONCLUSIONS,These effects were not apparent for normal weight and very obese women .
13284,BACKGROUND,"Low levels of adiponectin and T in men have been shown to predict development of the metabolic syndrome , but the effects of T on glucose metabolism are incompletely understood and may be influenced either directly or indirectly through changes in body composition or in levels of adiponectin ."
13285,OBJECTIVE,The aim of the study was to test whether T exerts its effects on glucose metabolism directly or indirectly .
13286,METHODS,"In a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study , 12 healthy young males were studied on four separate occasions ."
13287,METHODS,"They received GnRH agonist treatment 1 month before 3 of 4 trial days to induce castrate levels of T. On trial days , T gel containing either high or low physiological T dose or placebo was applied to the body ."
13288,METHODS,"On a fourth trial day , participants constituted their own eugonadal controls ."
13289,METHODS,Each study comprised a 5-hour basal period and a 3-hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp .
13290,METHODS,"We measured the effect of acute T on peripheral glucose disposal , total adiponectin and subforms , and other indices of glucose metabolism ."
13291,RESULTS,Short-term hypogonadism was associated with increased high molecular weight adiponectin levels ( P < .03 ) and increased oxidative glucose disposal ( P = .03 ) but not total glucose disposal ( P = .07 ) .
13292,RESULTS,Acute T treatment was an independent suppressor of high molecular weight adiponectin levels ( P = .04 ) but did not affect total glucose disposal ( P = .17 ) .
13293,CONCLUSIONS,These data show that T can act through putative fast nongenomic pathways to affect adiponectin levels in humans .
13294,CONCLUSIONS,"The early hypogonadal state is characterized by a marked shift in fuel oxidation from lipids toward glucose , which may rely partly on buffering capabilities of adiponectin ."
13295,OBJECTIVE,"The effectiveness of axillary brachial plexus block ( ABPB ) performed using peripheral nerve stimulation ( PNS ) alone was compared with PNS preceded by nerve localization using a pen device , enabling nerve mapping without puncturing the skin ."
13296,METHODS,Patients undergoing unilateral hand or forearm surgery suitable for ABPB were randomly assigned to receive either PNS alone ( pen - group ) or PNS preceded by nerve localization using a pen device ( pen + group ) .
13297,METHODS,Parameters related to the block procedure and patient comfort were assessed .
13298,RESULTS,Thirty patients were included in each group .
13299,RESULTS,The block performance time was longer in the pen + group than the pen - group despite a reduced number of needle insertions .
13300,RESULTS,The complete block rate was higher and intraoperative analgesic usage lower in the pen + group compared with the pen - group .
13301,RESULTS,Patient satisfaction and complication rates were similar in the two groups .
13302,CONCLUSIONS,"The pen device seems to be a helpful addition to PNS for ABPB , with improved results in terms of block success and patient comfort , but further studies are needed to confirm these findings ."
13303,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a 10 percent casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate ( CPP-ACP ) cream to reduce mutans streptococci ( MS ) colonization and prevent early childhood caries .
13304,METHODS,The cohort was randomized at mean age of 11 days old to receive once-daily CPP-ACP cream ( n = 102 ) or no product ( comparison group ; n = 89 ) from the time of first tooth eruption .
13305,METHODS,"All mothers were contacted by telephone at six , 12 , and 18 months and advised to brush their children 's teeth twice daily with low-dose fluoride toothpaste ."
13306,METHODS,"At 24 months , all children were examined at a community clinic ."
13307,RESULTS,"At 24 months old , one out of 65 ( 2 percent ) children in the CPP-ACP group had caries vs. four out of 58 ( seven percent ) in the comparison group ( difference not statistically significant ) ."
13308,RESULTS,There were fewer MS-positive children in the CPP-ACP group ( 26 percent ) vs. the comparison group ( 47 percent ; P = .02 ) .
13309,RESULTS,"A dose-response effect of CPP-ACP usage on MS was observed , where MS was present in eight percent of regular CPP-ACP users , 28 percent of irregular users , and 47 percent of non-users ( P < .02 ) ."
13310,CONCLUSIONS,"CPP-ACP reduced the percentages of mutans streptococci-positive 24-month-old children , although it did not reduce caries prevalence ."

13314,METHODS,"English-speaking , cognitively intact ( Mini-Mental State Examination score 24 ) , African Americans aged 55 and older with depressive symptoms ( Patient Health Questionnaire score 5 ) ( N = 129 ) ."
13315,METHODS,"Participants randomly assigned to BTB received up to 10 home visits over 4 months from licensed social workers who provided care management , referral and linkage , stress reduction , depression education , and behavioral activation to help participants achieve self-identified goals ."
13316,METHODS,Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICERs ) of BTB versus wait-list controls during the 4-month study period .
13317,METHODS,The primary ICER was defined as cost per quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) using the Euro Quality of Life 5D ( EQ-5D ) and secondarily using the Health Utilities Index-3 ( HUI-3 ) .
13318,METHODS,"Additional ICERs were calculated using clinical measures ( cost per depression improvement , cost per depression remission ) ."
13319,METHODS,"Costs included BTB intervention , depression-related healthcare visits and medications , caregiver time , and social services ."
13320,RESULTS,BTB cost per participant per month was $ 146 .
13321,RESULTS,"Base case ICERs were $ 64,896 per QALY ( EQ-5D ) and $ 36,875 per QALY ( HUI-3 ) ."
13322,RESULTS,"Incremental cost was $ 2,906 per depression improvement and $ 3,507 per remission ."
13323,RESULTS,"Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses yielded a cost/QALY range of $ 20,500 to $ 76,500 ."
13324,CONCLUSIONS,"Based on the range of cost-effectiveness values resulting from this study , BTB is a cost-effective treatment for managing depressive symptoms in older African Americans that compares favorably with the cost-effectiveness of previously tested approaches ."
13325,BACKGROUND,"Most patients relapse to opioids within one month of opioid agonist detoxification , making the antecedents and parallel processes of first use critical for investigation ."
13326,BACKGROUND,"Craving and withdrawal are often studied in relationship to opioid outcomes , and a novel analytic strategy applied to these two phenomena may indicate targeted intervention strategies ."
13327,METHODS,"Specifically , this secondary data analysis of the Prescription Opioid Addiction Treatment Study used a discrete-time mixture analysis with time-to-first opioid use ( survival ) simultaneously predicted by craving and withdrawal growth trajectories ."
13328,METHODS,"This analysis characterized heterogeneity among prescription opioid-dependent individuals ( N = 653 ) into latent classes ( i.e. , latent class analysis [ LCA ] ) during and after buprenorphine/naloxone stabilization and taper ."
13329,RESULTS,A 4-latent class solution was selected for overall model fit and clinical parsimony .
13330,RESULTS,"In order of shortest to longest time-to-first use , the 4 classes were characterized as 1 ) high craving and withdrawal , 2 ) intermediate craving and withdrawal , 3 ) high initial craving with low craving and withdrawal trajectories and 4 ) a low initial craving with low craving and withdrawal trajectories ."
13331,RESULTS,Odds ratio calculations showed statistically significant differences in time-to-first use across classes .
13332,CONCLUSIONS,"Generally , participants with lower baseline levels and greater decreases in craving and withdrawal during stabilization combined with slower craving and withdrawal rebound during buprenorphine taper remained opioid-free longer ."
13333,CONCLUSIONS,"This exploratory work expanded on the importance of monitoring craving and withdrawal during buprenorphine induction , stabilization , and taper ."
13334,CONCLUSIONS,Future research may allow individually tailored and timely interventions to be developed to extend time-to-first opioid use .
13335,BACKGROUND,Acne keloidalis nuchae ( AKN ) is a chronic scarring folliculitis with fibrotic papules on the occipital scalp .
13336,BACKGROUND,Its treatment is limited and unsatisfactory .
13337,OBJECTIVE,To determine whether targeted ultraviolet B ( tUVB ) phototherapy will ( i ) improve the clinical appearance of AKN and ( ii ) induce extracellular matrix remodelling in affected lesions .
13338,METHODS,"Eleven patients with AKN were enrolled in a prospective , randomized , split-scalp comparison study ."
13339,METHODS,One randomly selected side of the scalp was treated with tUVB up to three times weekly for 8weeks .
13340,METHODS,"After week 8 , both sides were treated for eight additional weeks ."
13341,METHODS,"Assessment included lesion counts in two 33-cm regions of interest ( ROIs ) , one on each side of the scalp ( ROI-1 : tUVB weeks 0-16 , ROI-2 : tUVB weeks 9-16 ) , patient self-assessment and analysis of MMP1 , MMP9 , TGFB1 and COL1A1 mRNA expression by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ."
13342,RESULTS,"Before treatment , the mean lesion count was similar between tUVB-treated and untreated sides ( 148 vs. 150 ) ."
13343,RESULTS,"After 8weeks of tUVB , the mean lesion count decreased significantly to 9412 ( P = 003 ) , with no change on the untreated side ."
13344,RESULTS,"With continued treatment , the mean lesion count in ROI-1 decreased further to 715 ( P = 004 ) after 16weeks of tUVB ."

13346,BACKGROUND,"Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) is a common condition ( prevalence of 4 % ) where the median nerve is compressed within the carpal tunnel resulting in numbness , tingling , and pain in the hand ."
13347,BACKGROUND,"Current non-surgical treatment options ( oral medication , corticosteroid injections , splinting , exercise , and mobilization ) show limited effects , especially in the long-term ."
13348,BACKGROUND,"Carpal tunnel release ( CTR ) surgery is effective in 70 to 75 % of patients , but is relatively invasive and can be accompanied by complications ."
13349,BACKGROUND,"In an observational study , mechanical traction proved to be effective in up to 70 % of patients directly after treatment and in 60 % after two years follow-up ."
13350,BACKGROUND,This randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) will examine the effectiveness of mechanical traction compared to care as usual in CTS .
13351,METHODS,Patients diagnosed with CTS will be recruited from an outpatient neurology clinic and randomly assigned to the intervention group ( mechanical traction ) or the control group ( care as usual ) .
13352,METHODS,Participants in the intervention group will receive 12 treatments with mechanical traction during six consecutive weeks .
13353,METHODS,"Primary outcome is symptom severity and functional status , which are measured with the Boston Carpel Tunnel Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) ."

13366,RESULTS,"Of the 401 patients initially enrolled , 377 patients were analyzed for efficacy ."
13367,RESULTS,"The RFS rates in the 600-mg group , the 300-mg group , and the placebo group were 71.9 , 63.6 , and 66.0 % at 1 year , and 43.7 , 24.9 , and 29.3 % at 3 years , respectively ."
13368,RESULTS,The primary comparison of peretinoin ( 300 and 600-mg ) with placebo was not significant ( P = 0.434 ) .
13369,RESULTS,"The dose-response relationship based on the hypothesis that `` efficacy begins to increase at 600 mg/day '' was significant ( P = 0.023 , multiplicity-adjusted P = 0.048 ) ."
13370,RESULTS,The hazard ratios for RFS in the 600-mg group vs. the placebo group were 0.73 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.51-1 .03 ] for the entire study period and 0.27 ( 95 % CI 0.07-0 .96 ) after 2 years of the randomization .
13371,RESULTS,"Common adverse events included ascites , increased blood pressure , headache , presence of urine albumin , and increased transaminases ."
13372,CONCLUSIONS,"Although the superiority of peretinoin to placebo could not be validated , 600 mg/day was shown to be the optimal dose , and treatment may possibly reduce the recurrence of HCV-HCC , particularly after 2 years ."
13373,CONCLUSIONS,The efficacy and safety of peretinoin 600 mg/day should continue to be evaluated in further studies .
13374,BACKGROUND,"Postoperative delirium is one of the most common complications of major surgery , affecting 10-70 % of surgical patients 60 years and older ."

13454,METHODS,Eighty-eight participants were randomly assigned to 40 weeks of im T undecanoate ( n = 45 ) or matching placebo ( n = 43 ) .
13455,METHODS,"Constitutional symptoms using the aging male symptoms ( AMS ) score , sexual desire ( question 17 AMS score ) , and erectile function ( International Index of Erectile Function-5 ) ."
13456,RESULTS,"T treatment did not substantially improve aging male symptoms [ mean adjusted difference ( MAD ) in change over 40 weeks across the T and placebo groups in AMS total score , -0.9 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] -4.1 , 2.2 ) , P = .67 ] or sexual desire [ MAD in question 17 AMS , -0.3 ( 95 % CI -0.8 , 0.2 ) , P = .17 ] ."
13457,RESULTS,"Although compared with placebo , erectile function in men assigned to T was reduced [ MAD in International Index of Erectile Function abridged version 5 , -2.0 ( 95 % CI -3.4 , -0.6 ) , P < .02 ] , there was no significant difference between baseline and 40-week International Index of Erectile Function abridged version 5 scores if both groups were analyzed separately ."
13458,RESULTS,"At baseline , symptoms were worse in men with depression and microvascular complications but did not correlate with T levels ."
13459,CONCLUSIONS,"In this trial , T treatment did not substantially improve constitutional or sexual symptoms in obese , aging men with T2D with mild to moderate symptoms and modest reduction in T levels typical for the vast majority of such men ."
13460,BACKGROUND,"According to the findings of some studies , instability due to inertia during changes in speed may negatively impact the quality of chest compressions performed during cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) in a moving environment ."
13461,BACKGROUND,"This study thus aimed to introduce a simple device that maintains the balance of a person performing CPR in a moving environment , such as an ambulance ."
13462,BACKGROUND,We also sought to evaluate the effectiveness of this device in the improvement of the quality of chest compressions .
13463,METHODS,"The experiment comprised a total of 40 simulated cardiopulmonary arrest scenes ( 20 in the experimental group and 20 in the control ) , in which CPR was conducted by eight paramedics ."
13464,METHODS,Each simulation involved two paramedics randomly selected from the eight .
13465,METHODS,"The ambulance took the same route from the simulated site to the hospital , and continuous CPR was performed on a manikin in the ambulance with or without the aid of our proposed novel device ."
13466,RESULTS,"The average number of chest compressions per simulation in the experimental and control groups was 1330.75 and 1266.60 , respectively ( p = 0.095 ) ."
13467,RESULTS,"The percentage of chest compressions with adequate depth achieved in the experimental and control groups was 72 % 4 % and 50 % 3 % , respectively ( p < 0.0001 ) ."
13468,CONCLUSIONS,"By maintaining the balance of the CPR performer , our proposed novel device can offset the negative impact that instability ( due to a moving environment ) has on chest compressions ."
13469,CONCLUSIONS,The device may also lead to an increase in the percentage of chest compressions that achieve adequate depth .
13470,BACKGROUND,"This pilot study examined , whether long-term exposure of psychiatric patients to music that was individually adapted to brain rhythm disorders associated with psychoticism could act to ameliorate psychiatric symptoms ."
13471,METHODS,A total of 50 patients with various psychiatric diagnoses were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to listen to CDs containing either music adapted to brain rhythm anomalies associated with psychoticism - measured via a specific spectral analysis - or standard classical music .
13472,METHODS,Participants were instructed to listen to the CDs over the next 18 months .
13473,METHODS,"Psychiatric symptoms in both groups were assessed at baseline and at 4 , 8 and 18 months , using the Brief Symptom Inventory ( BSI ) ."
13474,RESULTS,"At 18 months , patients in the experimental group showed significantly decreased BSI scores compared to control patients ."
13475,RESULTS,"Intriguingly , this effect was not only seen for symptoms of psychoticism and paranoia but also for anxiety , phobic anxiety and somatisation ."
13476,CONCLUSIONS,"Exposure to the adapted music was effective in ameliorating psychotic , anxiety and phobic anxiety symptoms ."
13477,CONCLUSIONS,"Based on the theories of neuroplasticity and brain rhythms , it can be hypothesised that this intervention may be enhancing brain-rhythm synchronisation and plasticity in prefrontal-hippocampal circuits that are implicated in both psychosis/paranoia and anxiety/phobic anxiety ."
13478,BACKGROUND,High US sodium intake and national reduction efforts necessitate developing a feasible and valid monitoring method across the distribution of low-to-high sodium intake .
13479,OBJECTIVE,We examined a statistical approach using timed urine voids to estimate the population distribution of usual 24-h sodium excretion .
13480,METHODS,"A sample of 407 adults , aged 18-39 y ( 54 % female , 48 % black ) , collected each void in a separate container for 24 h ; 133 repeated the procedure 4-11 d later ."
13481,METHODS,"Four timed voids ( morning , afternoon , evening , overnight ) were selected from each 24-h collection ."
13482,METHODS,"We developed gender-specific equations to calibrate total sodium excreted in each of the one-void ( e.g. , morning ) and combined two-void ( e.g. , morning + afternoon ) urines to 24-h sodium excretion ."
13483,METHODS,The calibrated sodium excretions were used to estimate the population distribution of usual 24-h sodium excretion .
13484,METHODS,Participants were then randomly assigned to modeling ( n = 160 ) or validation ( n = 247 ) groups to examine the bias in estimated population percentiles .
13485,RESULTS,"Median bias in predicting selected percentiles ( 5th , 25th , 50th , 75th , 95th ) of usual 24-h sodium excretion with one-void urines ranged from -367 to 284 mg ( -7.7 to 12.2 % of the observed usual excretions ) for men and -604 to 486 mg ( -14.6 to 23.7 % ) for women , and with two-void urines from -338 to 263 mg ( -6.9 to 10.4 % ) and -166 to 153 mg ( -4.1 to 8.1 % ) , respectively ."
13486,RESULTS,Four of the 6 two-void urine combinations produced no significant bias in predicting selected percentiles .
13487,CONCLUSIONS,"Our approach to estimate the population usual 24-h sodium excretion , which uses calibrated timed-void sodium to account for day-to-day variation and covariance between measurement errors , produced percentile estimates with relatively low biases across low-to-high sodium excretions ."
13488,CONCLUSIONS,"This may provide a low-burden , low-cost alternative to 24-h collections in monitoring population sodium intake among healthy young adults and merits further investigation in other population subgroups ."
13489,OBJECTIVE,"To observe the clinical curative effect of Chinese medicine Bushen Huoxue Granule ( , BHG ) on Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patients with depressive state ."
13490,METHODS,"Sixty-two PD patients with depressive state were randomly assigned to two groups by using a random number table , 31 in each group ."
13491,METHODS,Madopar was given to all as the conventional treatment .
13492,METHODS,The fluoxetine hydrochloride dispersible tablet was given to the patients in the control group and BHG was given to those in the treatment group .
13493,METHODS,The therapeutic course for all was 12 weeks .
13494,METHODS,"Before and after treatment , Hamilton depression rating scale ( HAMD ) was applied to judge the curative effect , and the changes of cerebral neurotransmitters levels in the brain of patients were detected by encephalofluctuograph technique ."
13495,RESULTS,The scores of HAMD in the two groups were decreased markedly after 12-week treatment .
13496,RESULTS,It was lower in the treatment group than that in the control group with significant difference ( P < 0.01 ) .
13497,RESULTS,The contents of norepinephrine ( NE ) and 5-serotonin ( 5-HT ) in the PD patients were obviously lower than normal value .
13498,RESULTS,There was no significant difference between the two groups before treatment ( P > 0.05 ) .
13499,RESULTS,"The contents of NE and 5-HT were all increased in the two groups after treatment ( P < 0.05 ) , with significant differences between the two groups ( P < 0.01 ) ."
13500,CONCLUSIONS,BHG could increase the contents of NE and 5-HT in PD patients ' brain to improve the depressive state of PD patients .
13501,OBJECTIVE,The optimum model of physiotherapy service delivery for maximizing active task practice during rehabilitation after stroke is unknown .
13502,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of the study was to examine the relative effectiveness of 2 alternative models of physiotherapy service delivery against a usual care control with regard to increasing patient activity .
13503,METHODS,"Substudy within a large 3-armed randomized controlled trial , which compared 3 different models of physiotherapy service delivery , was provided for 4 weeks during subacute , inpatient rehabilitation ( n = 283 ) ."
13504,METHODS,The duration of all physiotherapy sessions was recorded .
13505,METHODS,"In addition , 32 participants were observed at 10-minute intervals for 1 weekday and 1 weekend day between 8:00 am and 4:30 pm ."
13506,METHODS,"At each observation , we recorded physical activity , location , and people present ."
13507,RESULTS,"Participants receiving 7-day-week and circuit class therapy received an additional 3 hours and 22 hours of physiotherapy time , respectively , when compared with usual care ."
13508,RESULTS,Participants were standing or walking for a median of 8.2 % of observations .
13509,RESULTS,"On weekdays , circuit class therapy participants spent more time in therapy-related activity ( 10.2 % of observations ) when compared with usual care participants ( 6.1 % of observations ) ."
13510,RESULTS,"On weekends , 7-day therapy participants spent more time in therapy-related activity ( 4.2 % of observations ) when compared with both usual care and circuit class therapy participants ( 0 % of observations for both groups ) ."
13511,RESULTS,Activity levels outside of therapy sessions did not differ between groups .
13512,CONCLUSIONS,A greater dosage of physiotherapy time did not translate into meaningful increases in physical activity across the day .

13515,OBJECTIVE,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) of the left dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) exerts antidepressant effects .
13516,OBJECTIVE,In this randomised controlled clinical trial we aimed to test the safety and therapeutic efficacy of bilateral theta-burst stimulation ( TBS ) as an add-on therapy to standard treatment of major depression .
13517,METHODS,"Fifty-six patients diagnosed with a moderate to severe depressive episode received 15 daily treatments of either rTMS ( 110 % motor-threshold ; rightDLPFC , 1000 stimuli at 1 Hz + leftDLPFC , 1000 stimuli at 10 Hz ) , theta-burst stimulation ( 80 % motor-threshold ; rightDLPFC , continuous TBS , 1200 stimuli + leftDLPFC , intermittent TBS , 1200 stimuli ) , or sham TMS ( N = 17 , sham coil with the TBS protocol ) ."
13518,RESULTS,There was no significant effect in the primary outcome measures ( change of the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ) .
13519,RESULTS,"However , there was a tendency towards an increased responder rate at the end of the follow-up period for both active treatments as compared to sham , and this tendency was most pronounced for the TBS group ."
13520,CONCLUSIONS,This pilot study did not reveal significant advantages of bilateral TBS or rTMS over sham treatment as an add-on treatment for major depression .
13521,CONCLUSIONS,A tendency towards a superior effect of bilateral TBS at the end of the follow-up period may warrant further studies .
13522,OBJECTIVE,This study aimed to assess the dose and volume effects of suppository preparations and safety of NRL001 ( one of four possible stereoisomers of methoxamine hydrochloride ) on anal sphincter tone using rectal suppositories in healthy adult volunteers .
13523,METHODS,"This was a Phase I , single-centre , randomised , double-blind , three-way crossover study during which subjects received three single doses of 1 g rectal suppositories ( containing 5 or 10 mg NRL001 or matching placebo ) or 2 g rectal suppositories ( containing 10 or 15 mg NRL001 or matching placebo ) on three separate dosing days ."
13524,METHODS,"The outcome measures were mean anal resting pressure ( MARP ) variables ( monitored continuously for 20-30 min before and up to 6 h after dosing ) , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and safety assessments ."
13525,RESULTS,Twenty-six subjects were dosed with study medication .
13526,RESULTS,Two subjects were withdrawn prematurely and were not included in the main analysis .
13527,RESULTS,"There was a dose-dependent increase in anal sphincter tone ( MARP ) when comparing the 5 and 10 mg doses of NRL001 ; however , the 15 mg dose did not have a significantly greater effect than the 10 mg dose ."
13528,RESULTS,Suppository size ( 1 or 2 g ) did not appear to have an effect on sphincter tone .
13529,RESULTS,"There was no evidence against dose proportionality for the PK variables , but the mean maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) for the 1 g suppository group was higher than for the 2 g group ."
13530,RESULTS,Twenty-one adverse events were reported in 8 ( 30.8 % ) subjects .
13531,RESULTS,"A dose dependent decrease in heart rate was noted ; however , there were no adverse events reported that were related to this reduction in heart rate ."
13532,CONCLUSIONS,"The increase in anal sphincter tone supports the potential therapeutic use of NRL001 in treating faecal incontinence , with further studies in patients required ."
13533,CONCLUSIONS,NRL001 was well tolerated in single doses of up to 15 mg .
13534,OBJECTIVE,Depression and anxiety are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with recent acute cardiac events .
13535,OBJECTIVE,"There has been minimal study of collaborative care ( CC ) management models for mental health disorders in high-risk cardiac inpatients , and no prior CC intervention has simultaneously managed depression and anxiety disorders ."
13536,OBJECTIVE,"To determine the impact of a low-intensity CC intervention for depression , generalized anxiety disorder , and panic disorder among patients hospitalized for an acute cardiac illness ."
13537,METHODS,"Single-blind randomized clinical trial , with study assessors blind to group assignment , from September 2010 through July 2013 of 183 patients admitted to inpatient cardiac units in an urban academic general hospital for acute coronary syndrome , arrhythmia , or heart failure and found to have clinical depression , generalized anxiety disorder , or panic disorder on structured assessment ."
13538,METHODS,Participants were randomized to 24 weeks of a low-intensity telephone-based multicomponent CC intervention targeting depression and anxiety disorders ( n = 92 ) or to enhanced usual care ( serial notification of primary medical providers ; n = 91 ) .
13539,METHODS,The CC intervention used a social work care manager to coordinate assessment and stepped care of psychiatric conditions and to provide support and therapeutic interventions as appropriate .
13540,METHODS,"Improvement in mental health-related quality of life ( Short Form-12 Mental Component Score [ SF-12 MCS ] ) at 24 weeks , compared between groups using a random-effects model in an intent-to-treat analysis ."
13541,RESULTS,"Patients randomized to CC had significantly greater estimated mean improvements in SF-12 MCS at 24 weeks ( 11.21 points [ from 34.21 to 45.42 ] in the CC group vs 5.53 points [ from 36.30 to 41.83 ] in the control group ; estimated mean difference , 5.68 points [ 95 % CI , 2.14-9 .22 ] ; P = .002 ; effect size , 0.61 ) ."

13545,BACKGROUND,There are conflicting results on the impact of anxiety on depression outcomes .
13546,BACKGROUND,The impact of anxiety has not been studied in major depression with psychotic features ( `` psychotic depression '' ) .
13547,OBJECTIVE,We assessed the impact of specific anxiety symptoms and disorders on the outcomes of psychotic depression .
13548,METHODS,We analyzed data from the Study of Pharmacotherapy for Psychotic Depression that randomized 259 younger and older participants to either olanzapine plus placebo or olanzapine plus sertraline .
13549,METHODS,"We assessed the impact of specific anxiety symptoms from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( `` tension '' , `` anxiety '' and `` somatic concerns '' and a composite anxiety score ) and diagnoses ( panic disorder and GAD ) on psychotic depression outcomes using linear or logistic regression ."
13550,METHODS,"Age , gender , education and benzodiazepine use ( at baseline and end ) were included as covariates ."
13551,RESULTS,Anxiety symptoms at baseline and anxiety disorder diagnoses differentially impacted outcomes .
13552,RESULTS,On adjusted linear regression there was an association between improvement in depressive symptoms and both baseline `` tension '' ( coefficient = 0.784 ; 95 % CI : 0.169-1 .400 ; p = 0.013 ) and the composite anxiety score ( regression coefficient = 0.348 ; 95 % CI : 0.064-0 .632 ; p = 0.017 ) .
13553,RESULTS,"There was an interaction between `` tension '' and treatment group , with better responses in those randomized to combination treatment if they had high baseline anxiety scores ( coefficient = 1.309 ; 95 % CI : 0.105-2 .514 ; p = 0.033 ) ."
13554,RESULTS,"In contrast , panic disorder was associated with worse clinical outcomes ( coefficient = -3.858 ; 95 % CI : -7.281 to -0.434 ; p = 0.027 ) regardless of treatment ."
13555,CONCLUSIONS,Our results suggest that analysis of the impact of anxiety on depression outcome needs to differentiate psychic and somatic symptoms .
13556,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the feasibility and appropriateness of a prehospital system allowing ambulance nurses to transport older adults directly to geriatric care at a community-based hospital ( CH ) or to an emergency department ( ED ) .
13557,METHODS,Randomized controlled trial .
13558,METHODS,"Emergency medical services in Stockholm , Sweden ."
13559,METHODS,Older adults who called the emergency number were randomized to an intervention group ( n = 410 ) or a control group ( n = 396 ) .
13560,METHODS,The dispatcher randomized the individuals .
13561,METHODS,"Those randomized to the intervention group were transported to several alternative destinations decided by a trained nurse performing a comprehensive assessment , using the new prehospital system ."
13562,METHODS,Those randomized to the control group were transported to the ED .
13563,METHODS,Primary endpoint : number of individuals triaged directly to a CH ( feasibility ) .
13564,METHODS,Secondary endpoint : number of subsequent transfers ( appropriateness ) from CH to ED within 24 hours after initial admission .
13565,RESULTS,"After exclusion and crossover , the control group consisted of 217 and the intervention group of 449 older adults ."
13566,RESULTS,The nurse sent 20 % of the intervention group ( 90/449 ) ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 16.6-24 .0 ) directly to the CH when using the prehospital system .
13567,RESULTS,Six of those individuals ( 6.7 % ) ( 95 % CI = 3.1-13 .8 ) were subsequently transferred from the CH to the ED .
13568,RESULTS,"Overall , the nurse appropriately triaged 93.3 % of the participants ( 84/90 ) and transferred them to the CH , avoiding an ED visit ."
13569,CONCLUSIONS,Ambulance nurses are able to send older adults to an alternative healthcare facility with the help of a prehospital decision support system .
13570,CONCLUSIONS,"In this geographical setting , this appears to be a promising method to optimize resources and improve emergency care of elderly adults ."
13571,BACKGROUND,The culture in many team sports involves consumption of large amounts of alcohol after training/competition .
13572,BACKGROUND,The effect of such a practice on recovery processes underlying protein turnover in human skeletal muscle are unknown .
13573,BACKGROUND,We determined the effect of alcohol intake on rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis ( MPS ) following strenuous exercise with carbohydrate ( CHO ) or protein ingestion .
13574,METHODS,"In a randomized cross-over design , 8 physically active males completed three experimental trials comprising resistance exercise ( 85 reps leg extension , 80 % 1 repetition maximum ) followed by continuous ( 30 min , 63 % peak power output ( PPO ) ) and high intensity interval ( 1030 s , 110 % PPO ) cycling ."
13575,METHODS,"Immediately , and 4 h post-exercise , subjects consumed either 500 mL of whey protein ( 25 g ; PRO ) , alcohol ( 1.5 gkg body mass ) , 122 standard drinks ) co-ingested with protein ( ALC-PRO ) , or an energy-matched quantity of carbohydrate also with alcohol ( 25 g maltodextrin ; ALC-CHO ) ."
13576,METHODS,Subjects also consumed a CHO meal ( 1.5 g CHOkg body mass ) 2 h post-exercise .
13577,METHODS,"Muscle biopsies were taken at rest , 2 and 8 h post-exercise ."
13578,RESULTS,Blood alcohol concentration was elevated above baseline with ALC-CHO and ALC-PRO throughout recovery ( P < 0.05 ) .
13579,RESULTS,"Phosphorylation of mTOR ( Ser2448 ) 2 h after exercise was higher with PRO compared to ALC-PRO and ALC-CHO ( P < 0.05 ) , while p70S6K phosphorylation was higher 2 h post-exercise with ALC-PRO and PRO compared to ALC-CHO ( P < 0.05 ) ."
13580,RESULTS,"Rates of MPS increased above rest for all conditions ( 29-109 % , P < 0.05 ) ."
13581,RESULTS,"However , compared to PRO , there was a hierarchical reduction in MPS with ALC-PRO ( 24 % , P < 0.05 ) and with ALC-CHO ( 37 % , P < 0.05 ) ."
13582,CONCLUSIONS,"We provide novel data demonstrating that alcohol consumption reduces rates of MPS following a bout of concurrent exercise , even when co-ingested with protein ."
13583,CONCLUSIONS,We conclude that alcohol ingestion suppresses the anabolic response in skeletal muscle and may therefore impair recovery and adaptation to training and/or subsequent performance .
13584,OBJECTIVE,Postprandial hyperglycemia and blood glucose fluctuations increase the risk of macroangiopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) .
13585,OBJECTIVE,"However , few studies have examined the effects of oral hypoglycemic drugs on blood glucose fluctuations in daily life ."
13586,METHODS,Twenty-nine T2DM patients treated with acarbose were randomized to receive either sitagliptin ( 14 patients ) or mitiglinide ( 15 patients ) together with acarbose for 4 weeks .
13587,METHODS,Patients were then switched to a combination of 10 mg mitiglinide and 0.2 mg voglibose for 4 weeks .
13588,METHODS,All patients wore a continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) device for 5 - 7 days in week 3 of each treatment period .
13589,RESULTS,"The percentage of blood glucose levels in the hyperglycemic range , blood glucose indices derived from 24-h CGM profiles and the glycemic parameters ( HbA1c , glycated albumin and fasting plasma glucose ) were significantly improved by adding sitagliptin or mitiglinide to ongoing acarbose therapy ."
13590,RESULTS,These parameters also tended to improve in the mitiglinide/voglibose combination period .
13591,CONCLUSIONS,"Daily blood glucose fluctuations were significantly improved by adding sitagliptin or mitiglinide to acarbose , and improved after switching to the mitiglinide/voglibose combination ."
13592,CONCLUSIONS,Larger controlled studies are needed to verify the effects of adding sitagliptin or mitiglinide to acarbose on glucose fluctuations .
13593,BACKGROUND,Premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ) may have negative effects on women 's health and sometimes need therapeutic non-pharmacological management .
13594,OBJECTIVE,To determine the effect of oral consumption of 1000 mg Royal Jelly capsule on premenstrual syndrome .
13595,METHODS,"This is a randomized , triple-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial , which was conducted in Tehran University of Medical Sciences female dormitories between December 2011 and October 2012 ."
13596,METHODS,"The study population comprised 110 medical sciences student with PMS , whom were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group ."
13597,METHODS,"Each participant in the intervention group took one Royal jelly capsule orally per day , starting on the first day of menstruation and continued the same treatment daily throughout two consecutive menstrual cycles , while participants in the intervention group took placebo capsules as same method ."
13598,METHODS,The outcome measure in this study was PMS score as obtained through the Premenstrual Profile 2005 .
13599,RESULTS,The mean of personal characteristics and baseline level of the premenstrual score before intervention did not differ between groups .
13600,RESULTS,"After two consecutive months consumption of Royal Jelly , PMS score had decreased from 23.17 17.43 to 11.42 14.58 ( mean change : 11.75 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 8.31-15 .19 ) and in Placebo , PMS score changed from 21.48 16.39 to 20.27 15.76 ( mean change : 1.20 ; 95 % CI : -1.69 to 4.10 ) ."
13601,RESULTS,Also difference between mean changes was significant ( mean difference : 10.54 ; 95 % CI : 6.10-14 .98 ) .
13602,CONCLUSIONS,The results of the study have demonstrated that 2 months consumption of Royal Jelly was effective in reducing PMS .
13603,OBJECTIVE,"An earlier randomized controlled trial found that two middle school sexual education programs-a risk avoidance ( RA ) program and a risk reduction ( RR ) program-delayed initiation of sexual intercourse ( oral , vaginal , or anal sex ) and reduced other sexual risk behaviors in ninth grade ."
13604,OBJECTIVE,We examined whether these effects extended into 10th grade .
13605,METHODS,"Fifteen middle schools were randomly assigned to RA , RR , or control conditions ."
13606,METHODS,"Follow-up surveys were conducted with participating students in 10th grade ( n = 1,187 ; 29.2 % attrition ) ."
13607,RESULTS,"Participants were 60 % female , 50 % Hispanic , and 39 % black ; seventh grade mean age was 12.6 years ."
13608,RESULTS,"In 10th grade , compared with the control condition , both programs significantly delayed anal sex initiation in the total sample ( RA : adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] , .64 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , .42 -.99 ; RR : AOR , .65 , 95 % CI , .50 -.84 ) and among Hispanics ( RA : AOR , .53 , 95 % CI , .31 -.91 ; RR : AOR , .82 , 95 % CI , .74 -.93 ) ."
13609,RESULTS,"Risk avoidance students were less likely to report unprotected vaginal sex , either by using a condom or by abstaining from sex ( AOR : .61 , 95 % CI , .45 -.85 ) ; RR students were less likely to report recent unprotected anal sex ( AOR : .34 , 95 % CI , .20 -.56 ) ."
13610,RESULTS,Both programs sustained positive impact on some psychosocial outcomes .
13611,CONCLUSIONS,"Although both programs delayed anal sex initiation into 10th grade , effects on the delayed initiation of oral and vaginal sex were not sustained ."
13612,CONCLUSIONS,Additional high school sexual education may help to further delay sexual initiation and reduce other sexual risk behaviors in later high school years .
13613,BACKGROUND,"Lutein accumulates in the macula and brain , where it is assumed to play physiologic roles ."
13614,BACKGROUND,"The bioavailability of lutein is assumed to display a high interindividual variability that has been hypothesized to be attributable , at least partly , to genetic polymorphisms ."
13615,OBJECTIVE,"We characterized the interindividual variability in lutein bioavailability in humans , assessed the relation between this variability and the fasting blood lutein concentration , and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) involved in this phenomenon ."
13616,METHODS,"In a randomized , 2-way crossover study , 39 healthy men consumed a meal that contained a lutein supplement or the same meal for which lutein was provided through a tomato puree ."
13617,METHODS,The lutein concentration was measured in plasma chylomicrons isolated at regular time intervals over 8 h postprandially .
13618,METHODS,Multivariate statistical analyses were used to identify a combination of SNPs associated with the postprandial chylomicron lutein response ( 0-8-h area under the curve ) .
13619,METHODS,A total of 1785 SNPs in 51 candidate genes were selected .
13620,RESULTS,"Postprandial chylomicron lutein responses to meals were very variable ( CV of 75 % and 137 % for the lutein-supplement meal and the meal with tomato-sourced lutein , respectively ) ."
13621,RESULTS,"Postprandial chylomicron lutein responses measured after the 2 meals were positively correlated ( r = 0.68 , P < 0.0001 ) and positively correlated to the fasting plasma lutein concentration ( r = 0.51 , P < 0.005 for the lutein-supplement-containing meal ) ."
13622,RESULTS,"A significant ( P = 1.9 10 ( -4 ) ) and validated partial least-squares regression model , which included 29 SNPs in 15 genes , explained most of the variance in the postprandial chylomicron lutein response ."
13623,CONCLUSIONS,"The ability to respond to lutein appears to be , at least in part , genetically determined ."
13624,CONCLUSIONS,"The ability is explained , in large part , by a combination of SNPs in 15 genes related to both lutein and chylomicron metabolism ."

13770,OBJECTIVE,The immunosuppressant tacrolimus is usually administered orally .
13771,OBJECTIVE,"When this is not feasible , other routes of administration may be useful ."
13772,OBJECTIVE,Previous research suggested that tacrolimus may be applied sublingually or rectally .
13773,OBJECTIVE,Pharmacokinetic data are sparse .
13774,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the pharmacokinetics of these alternative formulations with orally administered tacrolimus .

13822,OBJECTIVE,Renal dysfunction is a common comorbidity in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) .
13823,OBJECTIVE,We sought to determine whether renal dysfunction was associated with measures of cardiovascular structure/function in patients with HFpEF .
13824,METHODS,We studied 217 participants from the PARAMOUNT study with HFpEF who had echocardiography and measures of kidney function .
13825,METHODS,We evaluated the relationships between renal dysfunction [ estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) > 30 and < 60 mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) and/or albuminuria ] and cardiovascular structure/function .
13826,RESULTS,"The mean age of the study population was 71 years , 55 % were women , 94 % hypertensive , and 40 % diabetic ."
13827,RESULTS,"Impairment of at least one parameter of kidney function was present in 62 % of patients ( 16 % only albuminuria , 23 % only low eGFR , 23 % both ) ."
13828,RESULTS,"Renal dysfunction was associated with abnormal LV geometry ( defined as concentric hypertrophy , or eccentric hypertrophy , or concentric remodelling ) ( adjusted P = 0.048 ) , lower midwall fractional shortening ( MWFS ) ( P = 0.009 ) , and higher NT-proBNP ( P = 0.006 ) ."
13829,RESULTS,"Compared with patients without renal dysfunction , those with low eGFR and no albuminuria had a higher prevalence of abnormal LV geometry ( P = 0.032 ) and lower MWFS ( P < 0.01 ) , as opposed to those with only albuminuria ."
13830,RESULTS,"Conversely , albuminuria alone was associated with greater LV dimensions ( P < 0.05 ) ."
13831,RESULTS,"Patients with combined renal impairment had mixed abnormalities ( higher LV wall thicknesses , NT-proBNP ; lower MWFS ) ."
13832,CONCLUSIONS,"Renal dysfunction , as determined by both eGFR and albuminuria , is highly prevalent in HFpEF , and associated with cardiac remodelling and subtle systolic dysfunction ."
13833,CONCLUSIONS,The observed differences in cardiac structure/function between each type of renal damage suggest that both parameters of kidney function might play a distinct role in HFpEF .
13834,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of a new cationic emulsion ( CE ) with a formulation of polyvinyl alcohol and povidone ( PVA-P ) for the treatment of mild to moderate dry eye disease .

13841,RESULTS,"The same applied for the palpebral erythema score ( P = 0.023 ) , overall efficacy assessed by the investigators ( P < 0.001 ) , and symptoms not related to eye drop instillation ( P = 0.021 ) ."
13842,RESULTS,Improvement was observed from D7 .
13843,RESULTS,No difference was observed between the two treatments with regard to ocular safety .
13844,CONCLUSIONS,"These results suggest that in patients with mild to moderate dry eye , Cationorm , in addition to its moisturizing and lubricating properties , also helps stabilize the tear film due to its oily component ."

14054,RESULTS,"Although there was no difference in infarct size , behavior , or optical intrinsic signal maps in the first 7 days after stroke , mice treated chronically with memantine showed significant improvements in motor control , measured by cylinder test and grid-walking performance , compared with vehicle-treated animals ."
14055,RESULTS,Optical intrinsic signal revealed an increased area of forepaw sensory maps at 28 days after stroke .
14056,RESULTS,There was decreased reactive astrogliosis and increased vascular density around the infarcted cortex .
14057,RESULTS,Peri-infarct Western blots revealed increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and phosphorylated-tropomyosin-related kinase-B receptor expression .
14058,CONCLUSIONS,"Our results suggest that memantine improves stroke outcomes in an apparently non-neuroprotective manner involving increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling , reduced reactive astrogliosis , and improved vascularization , associated with improved recovery of sensory and motor cortical function ."
14059,CONCLUSIONS,The clinical availability and tolerability of memantine make it an attractive candidate for clinical translation .

14471,METHODS,Twenty-five subjects with moderate gingival inflammation ( Le and Silness Gingival Index 2 ) and pocket depths < 4 were randomly assigned to brush twice daily for 21 days with the test or the control dental gel .
14472,METHODS,In vivo multimodality in situ imaging was performed over a 3-week period using in vivo Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) and Non-Linear Optical microscopy ( NLOM ) .
14473,METHODS,"Plaque levels , gingival inflammation and gingival bleeding were also charted on days 0 , 7 , 14 , and 21 using standard clinical indices ."
14474,RESULTS,"After 3 weeks , OCT and NLOM images showed a macroscopic break-up of the plaque layer and smaller , fragmented residual deposits in the test group with no apparent changes in the pellicle ."
14475,RESULTS,"Biofilm was also reduced in the control group , but to a lesser degree with regard to thickness , continuity and surface area ."
14476,RESULTS,"Paralleling these imaging results , clinical indices were significantly improved in both groups ( P < 0.05 ) and significantly lower in the test group ( P < 0.05 ) ."
14477,CONCLUSIONS,Both dental gels reduced oral biofilm with the test gel showing greater efficacy ( P < 0.05 ) as determined by clinical and imaging parameters .
14478,OBJECTIVE,"This study examined the impact of pictorial cigarette-warning labels , warning-label message framing and plain cigarette packaging , on young adult smokers ' motivation to quit ."
14479,METHODS,"Smokers aged 18-30 years ( n = 740 ) from a consumer research panel were randomised to one of four experimental conditions where they viewed online images of four cigarette packs with warnings about lung disease , cancer , stroke/heart disease and death , respectively ."
14480,METHODS,Packs differed across conditions by warning-message framing ( gain vs loss ) and packaging ( branded vs plain ) .
14481,METHODS,"Measures captured demographics , smoking behaviour , covariates and motivation to quit in response to cigarette packs ."
14482,RESULTS,Pictorial warnings about lung disease and cancer generated the strongest motivation to quit across conditions .
14483,RESULTS,"Adjusting for pretest motivation and covariates , a message framing by packaging interaction revealed gain-framed warnings on plain packs generated greater motivation to quit for lung disease , cancer and mortality warnings ( p < 0.05 ) , compared with loss-framed warnings on plain packs ."
14484,CONCLUSIONS,"Warnings combining pictorial depictions of smoking-related health risks with text-based messages about how quitting reduces risks , may achieve better outcomes among young adults , especially in countries considering or implementing plain packaging regulations ."
14485,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CO2 insufflation on the pressure of the middle ear cavity ( PMEC ) during laparoscopic surgery under total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) with propofol or sevoflurane as an inhalational anesthetic maintenance .
14486,METHODS,Sixty patients who underwent laparoscopic/or non-laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia were included in the study .
14487,METHODS,"For anesthetic maintenance with inhalation agents , 20 non-laparoscopic surgery patients in Group 1 were applied sevoflurane ( 2-2 .5 % ) ."
14488,METHODS,Forty patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery were randomized into two groups .
14489,METHODS,Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane ( 2-2 .5 % ) in twenty patients in Group 2 and the TIVA technique in 20 patients in Group 3 .
14490,METHODS,"In Group 1 , PMEC was measured before anesthesia , 10 and 30 min after endotracheal intubation , 10 min before extubation , and 15 , 30 , 60 min and 6 hours in the postoperative period ."
14491,METHODS,"In Group 2 and 3 , PMEC was measured before the anesthesia , 10 min after intubation , 10 and 30 min after CO2 insufflation , just before the CO2 elimination , 10 min before the extubation , and 15 , 30 , 60 min and 6 hours after extubation in the postoperative period ."
14492,RESULTS,"PMEC was significantly increased in Group 1 at 10 min after intubation , at 30 min of the operation , before extubation , and at postoperative 15 and 30 min ( p < 0.05 ) ."
14493,RESULTS,"In Group 3 , differences between PMECs were detected at the 30th min of insufflation ( p = 0.005 ) , and during elimination ( p = 0.035 ) compared to the initial measurement ."
14494,RESULTS,"Generally , the values remained positive in Group 1 and negative in Group 3 ."
14495,RESULTS,There was a significant difference between Group 1 and Group 3 at 10 min after the induction ( p = 0.001 ) .
14496,RESULTS,There was no statistically significant difference in PMECs between Group 2 and 3 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery .
14497,CONCLUSIONS,"Our results indicate that , in laparoscopic surgery , TIVA used for the maintenance of anesthesia did not increase the PMEC and the changes caused by sevoflurane were also in the normal range of middle ear pressures ."
14498,CONCLUSIONS,"In patients with previous ear surgery , if there is a need of classical surgical procedures in the future , sevoflurane anesthesia should not be the first choice due to its effects on PMEC , which cause it to be increased over 50 daPa , especially at 30 min after intubation ."
14499,CONCLUSIONS,Patient characteristics including previous ear surgery should be considered in selecting the optimum anesthetic agents and technique .
14500,OBJECTIVE,It has been suggested that statins have an effect on the modulation of the cytokine cascade and on the outcome of patients with community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) .
14501,OBJECTIVE,"The aim of this prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was to determine whether statin therapy given to hospitalised patients with CAP improves clinical outcomes and reduces the concentration of inflammatory cytokines ."
14502,METHODS,"A tertiary teaching hospital in Barcelona , Spain ."
14503,METHODS,Thirty-four patients were randomly assigned and included in an intention-to-treat analysis ( 19 to the simvastatin group and 15 to the placebo group ) .
14504,METHODS,Patients were randomly assigned to receive 20mg of simvastatin or placebo administered in the first 24h of hospital admission and once daily thereafter for 4days .
14505,RESULTS,Primary end point was the time from hospital admission to clinical stability .
14506,RESULTS,The secondary end points were serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fractional inspired oxygen ( PaO2/FiO2 ) at 48h after treatment administration .
14507,RESULTS,The trial was stopped because enrolment was much slower than originally anticipated .
14508,RESULTS,The baseline characteristics of the patients and cytokine concentrations at the time of enrolment were similar in the two groups .
14509,RESULTS,"No significant differences in the time from hospital admission to clinical stability were found between study groups ( median 3days , IQR 2-5 vs 3days , IQR 2-5 ; p = 0.47 ) ."
14510,RESULTS,"No significant differences in PaO2/FiO2 ( p = 0.37 ) , C reactive protein ( p = 0.23 ) , tumour necrosis factor - ( p = 0.58 ) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ; p = 0.64 ) , and IL-10 ( p = 0.61 ) levels at 48h of hospitalisation were found between simvastatin and placebo groups ."
14511,RESULTS,"Similarly , transaminase and total creatine kinase levels were similar between study groups at 48h of hospitalisation ( p = 0.19 , 0.08 and 0.53 , respectively ) ."
14512,CONCLUSIONS,"Our results suggest that the use of simvastatin , 20mg once daily for 4days , since hospital admission did not reduce the time to clinical stability and the levels of inflammatory cytokines in hospitalised patients with CAP ."

14652,METHODS,"In 2011 , in a representative sample of 5,240 households , we asked women who had given birth in the previous year both about counselling visits and their childbirth and newborn care practices ."
14653,RESULTS,"Four of 14 newborn care practices were more commonly reported in intervention than comparison areas : delaying the baby 's first bath by at least six hours ( 81 % versus 68 % , OR 2.0 ( 95 % CI 1.2-3 .4 ) ) , exclusive breastfeeding in the three days after birth ( 83 % versus 71 % , OR 1.9 ( 95 % CI 1.3-2 .9 ) ) , putting nothing on the cord ( 87 % versus 70 % , OR 2.8 ( 95 % CI 1.7-4 .6 ) ) , and , for home births , tying the cord with a clean thread ( 69 % versus 39 % , OR 3.4 ( 95 % CI 1.5-7 .5 ) ) ."
14654,RESULTS,"For other behaviours there was little evidence of differences in reported practices between intervention and comparison areas including childbirth in a health facility or with a skilled attendant , thermal care practices , breastfeeding within an hour of birth and , for home births , the birth attendant having clean hands , cutting the cord with a clean blade and birth preparedness activities ."
14655,CONCLUSIONS,A home-based counselling strategy using volunteers and designed for scale-up can improve newborn care behaviours in rural communities of southern Tanzania .
14656,CONCLUSIONS,"Further research is needed to evaluate if , and at what cost , these gains will lead to improved newborn survival ."
14657,BACKGROUND,"Trial Registration Number NCT01022788 ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov , 2009 ) ."
14658,OBJECTIVE,"To investigate the relationships between AMG 811 exposure , concentration changes in serum IFN - , and IFN -- induced protein 10 ( CXCL10 ) , and to identify important contributions of baseline covariates to these relationships ."
14659,METHODS,A mechanism based pharmacokinetic ( PK ) - pharmacodynamic ( PD ) model was developed .
14660,METHODS,A target mediated disposition model was used to describe AMG 811 and target IFN - interaction .
14661,METHODS,CXCL10 was predicted to be driven by estimated free IFN - levels .
14662,RESULTS,"For an average systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) subject , the linear clearance ( CL ) of AMG 811 was 0.176 L/day , and the central ( Vc ) and peripheral ( Vp ) volumes of distribution were 1.48 and 2.12 L , respectively ."
14663,RESULTS,"Body weight was found to correlate with CL , Vc , Vp , and inter compartment clearance ( Q ) ; and age was found to correlate with Vc ."
14664,RESULTS,"The relationship between estimated free serum IFN - concentration levels and serum CXCL10 in logarithmic scales was best described by a linear model with slope and intercept estimated to be 0.197 and -0.3 , respectively ."
14665,CONCLUSIONS,The largest observed reduction of serum CXCL10 concentration was achieved at the highest AMG 811 dose tested ( 180 mg SC ) .
14666,CONCLUSIONS,This model enables simulations of AMG 811 PK-PD profiles under various dosing regimens to support future clinical studies .
14667,OBJECTIVE,"We evaluated whether stress levels in children and parents during radiological evaluation after febrile urinary tract infection are really lower using the top-down approach , where ( 99m ) technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy is used initially , than the bottom-up approach , where voiding cystourethrography is initially performed and repeated examinations are easier for all ."
14668,METHODS,We prospectively evaluated 120 children 3 to 8 years old .
14669,METHODS,"Pain ratings were obtained using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised , and conversation during the procedure was evaluated using the Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale-Revised by 2 independent observers ."
14670,METHODS,"To evaluate parental anxiety , the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory form was also completed ."
14671,METHODS,Following a documented febrile urinary tract infection children were randomized to the top-down or bottom-up group .
14672,METHODS,A third group of 44 children undergoing repeat voiding cystourethrography and their parents were also evaluated .
14673,RESULTS,Child ratings of pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised were not significantly different between the top-down group following ( 99m ) technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy ( 2.99 on a scale of 10 ) and the bottom-up group following voiding cystourethrography ( 3.21 ) .
14674,RESULTS,Also the Faces Pain Scale-Revised was not significantly different in the repeat voiding cystourethrography group ( 3.35 ) .
14675,RESULTS,"On the Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale-Revised there was negative correlation between child coping and child distress , as well as rate of child distress and adult coping promoting behavior ."
14676,RESULTS,Parental state anxiety scores were significantly less in the top-down and repeat voiding cystourethrography groups than in the bottom-up group .
14677,CONCLUSIONS,"Although the top-down approach and repeat voiding cystourethrography cause less anxiety for caregivers , these values do not correlate to pain scale in children ."
14678,CONCLUSIONS,This finding might be due to lack of appropriate evaluation tools of pediatric pain and anxiety .
14679,CONCLUSIONS,"However , the theory that the top-down approach is less invasive , and thus less stressful , requires further research ."
14680,CONCLUSIONS,The Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale-Revised data indicate that influences in adult-child interaction are bidirectional .
14681,BACKGROUND,Atelectasis is common during and after general anaesthesia .
14682,BACKGROUND,We hypothesized that a ventilation strategy with a combination of 1 ) continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) or positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) and 2 ) a reduced end-expiratory oxygen concentration during recovery would reduce post-operative atelectasis .
14683,METHODS,Sixty patients were randomized into two groups .
14684,METHODS,"During anaesthesia induction , inspiratory oxygen fraction ( FIO2 ) was 1.0 , and depending on weight , CPAP 6 , 7 or 8 cmH2O was applied in both groups via facemask ."
14685,METHODS,"During maintenance of anaesthesia , a laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) was used , and PEEP was 6-8 cmH2O in both groups ."
14686,METHODS,"Before removal of the LMA , FIO2 was set to 0.3 in the intervention group and 1.0 in the control group ."
14687,METHODS,Atelectasis was studied by computed tomography ( CT ) approximately 14 min post-operatively .
14688,RESULTS,In one patient in the group given an FIO2 of 0.3 before removal of the LMA a CT scan could not be performed so the patient was excluded .
14689,RESULTS,"The area of atelectasis was 5.5 , 0-16 .9 cm ( 2 ) ( median and range ) , and 6.8 , 0-27 .5 cm ( 2 ) in the groups given FIO2 0.3 or FIO2 1.0 before removal of the LMA , a difference that was not statistically significant ( P = 0.48 ) ."
14690,RESULTS,"Post-hoc analysis showed dependence of atelectasis on smoking ( despite all were clinically lung healthy ) and American Society of Anesthesiologists class ( P = 0.038 and 0.015 , respectively ) ."
14691,CONCLUSIONS,Inducing anaesthesia with CPAP/PEEP and FIO2 1.0 and deliberately reducing FIO2 during recovery before removal of the LMA did not reduce post-operative atelectasis compared with FIO2 1.0 before removal of the LMA .
14692,OBJECTIVE,A classic general anesthesia is performed by induction with an intravenous hypnotic ( such as propofol ) and maintenance with a volatile anesthetic ( such as sevoflurane ) .
14693,OBJECTIVE,The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of a propofol/sevoflurane maintenance regimen with that of a sevoflurane regimen on recovery profiles .
14694,METHODS,"One hundred and sixty patients , who were ASA 1 or 2 , 45-65 years of age , and scheduled for elective gastrointestinal surgery under combined general/epidural anesthesia , were allocated randomly to receive the sevoflurane maintenance regimen ( group S , n = 80 ) or sevoflurane/propofol regimen ( group SP , n = 80 ) ."
14695,METHODS,"After induction , anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in group S and sevoflurane with propofol ( 1.2 g/ml target plasma concentration ) in group SP ."
14696,METHODS,Bispectral index ( BIS ) values were maintained within 40-60 during the maintenance .
14697,METHODS,"Time to extubation , incidence of serious coughing and agitation , and other recovery characteristics were evaluated during emergence ."
14698,RESULTS,"The time to awakening and extubation in group SP were 7.2 2 min and 8.0 1.8 min , respectively , which were shorter than those results in group S ( 12.3 1.5 and 12.8 1.6 min , respectively ) ( P < 0.05 ) ."
14699,RESULTS,The incidence of serious coughing and agitation in SP ( 30 % and 25 % ) was lower than that of group S ( 68 % and 53 % ) ( P < 0.05 ) .
14700,RESULTS,"BIS value , pain score , requirements of analgesics and antiemetics in the PACU , and length of stay in the PACU were similar in the two groups ."
14701,CONCLUSIONS,"Compared to sevoflurane maintenance , coadministration of propofol and sevoflurane provides faster awakening and extubation with a low incidence of emergence coughing and agitation ."
14702,OBJECTIVE,"To compare two intrathecal anaesthetics , bupivacaine and levobupivacaine , for their effects on motor and sensory blockade and haemodynamics in patients aged 65 years undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate ( TUR-P ) or transurethral resection of the urinary bladder ( TUR-M ) ."
14703,METHODS,Patients scheduled to undergo TUR-P or TUR-M were randomized to receive either 3 ml ( 15 mg ) 0.5 % isobaric levobupivacaine ( group L ) or 3 ml ( 15 mg ) of 0.5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine ( group B ) for spinal anaesthesia .
14704,METHODS,"The onset time , maximum level and time to reach the maximum level of sensory and motor blockade were recorded ."
14705,METHODS,Changes to haemodynamic parameters were also recorded .
14706,RESULTS,"The study randomized 100 patients : 57 to group L and 43 to group B. Levobupivacaine did not cause any significant changes in haemodynamic parameters , including systolic blood pressure , and showed a similar sensory block onset time compared with bupivacaine , but it had a significantly longer motor block onset time compared with bupivacaine ."
14707,CONCLUSIONS,These current findings suggest that levobupivacaine can be used as a substitute for bupivacaine for spinal anaesthesia in elderly patients 65 years of age undergoing elective TUR-P or TUR-M operations .
14708,BACKGROUND,Breast reconstruction aims to improve health-related quality of life after mastectomy .
14709,BACKGROUND,"However , evidence guiding patients and surgeons in shared decision-making concerning the optimal type or timing of surgery is lacking ."
14710,METHODS,QUEST comprised two parallel feasibility phase III randomized multicentre trials to assess the impact of the type and timing of latissimus dorsi breast reconstruction on health-related quality of life when postmastectomy radiotherapy is unlikely ( QUEST A ) or highly probable ( QUEST B ) .
14711,METHODS,"The primary endpoint for the feasibility phase was the proportion of women who accepted randomization , and it would be considered feasible if patient acceptability rates exceeded 25 per cent of women approached ."
14712,METHODS,A companion QUEST Perspectives Study ( QPS ) of patients ( both accepting and declining trial participation ) and healthcare professionals assessed trial acceptability .
14713,RESULTS,The QUEST trials opened in 15 UK centres .
14714,RESULTS,"After 18 months of recruitment , 17 patients were randomized to QUEST A and eight to QUEST B , with overall acceptance rates of 19 per cent ( 17 of 88 ) and 22 per cent ( 8 of 36 ) respectively ."
14715,RESULTS,The QPS recruited 56 patients and 51 healthcare professionals .
14716,RESULTS,"Patient preference was the predominant reason for declining trial entry , given by 47 ( 53 per cent ) of the 88 patients approached for QUEST A and 22 ( 61 per cent ) of the 36 approached for QUEST B. Both trials closed to recruitment in December 2012 , acknowledging the challenges of achieving satisfactory patient accrual ."
14717,CONCLUSIONS,"Despite extensive efforts to overcome recruitment barriers , it was not feasible to reach timely recruitment targets within a feasibility study ."
14718,CONCLUSIONS,"Patient preferences for breast reconstruction types and timings were common , rendering patients unwilling to enter the trial ."
14719,BACKGROUND,The depressor septi nasi muscle is responsible for smiling deformity .
14720,BACKGROUND,Its manipulation is beneficial in patients with muscle hypertrophy .
14721,BACKGROUND,"In addition , it enhances the smile and tip-lip relationship ."
14722,BACKGROUND,"In this study , depressor septi nasi muscle excision through a transfixion incision is compared with its transposition through an upper labial sulcus incision ."
14723,METHODS,Two techniques of depressor septi nasi muscle treatment were performed randomly for rhinoplasty cases .
14724,METHODS,"Smile analysis in rhinoplasty , consisting of measurements of nasal length , nasal diagonal , tip projection , and upper lip height , and noting transverse upper labial crease in repose and full smile , was performed on preoperative and postoperative photographs ."
14725,RESULTS,One hundred patients were studied in two equal groups .
14726,RESULTS,"Preoperatively , tip projection and upper lip height were decreased significantly with smiling ."
14727,RESULTS,"Generally , the effect of smiling on all five parameters was decreased significantly following rhinoplasty ."
14728,RESULTS,"The two different techniques were not significantly different in decreasing the effects of smiling on nasal length , nasal diagonal , tip projection , upper lip height , or transverse crease ."
14729,CONCLUSIONS,The two different techniques were the same in decreasing the effects of smiling .
14730,CONCLUSIONS,"The authors recommend smile analysis in rhinoplasty , consisting of measurement of nasal length , nasal diagonal , tip projection , and upper lip height , and noting transverse upper labial crease in repose and during smiling , before rhinoplasty for preoperative evaluation and after the operation for outcome assessment ."
14731,CONCLUSIONS,Depressor septi nasi muscle treatment should be considered if a decrease in tip projection or upper lip height with smiling or a transverse upper labial crease during smiling is extraordinary or unsightly .

14735,METHODS,"In this double-blinded randomized controlled trial ( ISRCTN 05542931 ) , 33 patients ( mean 37.7 months poststroke ) were block randomized to 2 groups : active or sham SS ."
14736,METHODS,They received 12 sessions of 2 hours of SS ( active or sham ) to all 3 upper limb nerves immediately before 30 minutes of TST .
14737,METHODS,The primary outcome was the Action Research Arm Test ( ARAT ) score .
14738,METHODS,"Secondary outcomes were time to perform the ARAT , Fugl-Meyer Assessment score ( FM ) , Motor Activity Log ( MAL ) , and Goal Attainment Scale ( GAS ) ."
14739,METHODS,Underlying mechanisms were explored using transcranial magnetic stimulation stimulus-response curves and intracortical inhibition .
14740,METHODS,"Outcomes were assessed at baseline , immediately following the intervention ( mean 2 days ) , and 3 and 6 months ( mean 96 and 190 days ) after the intervention ."
14741,RESULTS,"The active group ( n = 16 ) demonstrated greater improvement in ARAT score and time immediately postintervention ( between-group difference ; P < .05 ) , but not at 3 - or 6-month follow-ups ( P > .2 ) ."
14742,RESULTS,"Within-group improvements were seen for both groups for ARAT and GAS , but for the active group only for FM and MAL ( P < .05 ) ."
14743,RESULTS,Corticospinal excitability did not change .
14744,CONCLUSIONS,Long-lasting improvements in upper limb function were observed following TST .
14745,CONCLUSIONS,"Additional benefit of SS was seen immediately post treatment , but did not persist and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear ."
14746,BACKGROUND,"There is current interest in the maternal-fetal effects of antenatal vitamin D supplementation , yet little data regarding vitamin D 's role in neonatal calcium homeostasis ."
14747,BACKGROUND,We determined to assess the effect of high-dose antenatal vitamin D supplementation on fetal and neonatal calcium concentrations .
14748,METHODS,"In a double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial in Bangladesh , 160 pregnant women were randomized to oral vitamin D3 ( 35,000 IU/wk ) or placebo from 26 to 29wk of gestation ."
14749,RESULTS,"Total serum calcium ( Ca ) was higher in cord blood of those supplemented vs. placebo ( 2.660.1 vs. 2.610.2 mmol/l ; P = 0.04 ) , but the difference in albumin-adjusted calcium was not statistically significant ."
14750,RESULTS,Change in Ca concentration from birth to day 3 of life was attenuated by vitamin D ( -0.100.17 ) compared with placebo ( -0.220.18 mmol/l ; P = 0.02 ) .
14751,RESULTS,"Maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) ( P = 0.04 ) and cord 25 ( OH ) D ( P < 0.01 ) were associated with day 3 infant Ca , suggesting that the effect of supplementation was mediated by change in maternal-infant vitamin D status ."
14752,RESULTS,"Six infants in each of the supplemented and placebo groups had transient hypercalcemia/hypercalcuria ; in all the hypercalcemia/hypercalcuria was asymptomatic , spontaneously resolved , and unassociated with nephrocalcinosis at 1 mo of life ."
14753,CONCLUSIONS,"High-dose antenatal third-trimester vitamin D supplementation attenuated the early postnatal calcium nadir , without increasing the risk of postnatal hypercalcemia ."

14769,METHODS,"After real-time determination of a seventh SABA canister dispensing in the prior 12 months by using informational pharmacy technology , 12 to 56 year old patients with physician-coded asthma and inhaled corticosteroid dispensing were block randomized by prior asthma specialist care and medication step-care level into intervention ( n = 1001 ) and control groups ( n = 998 ) ."
14770,METHODS,"Intervention included real-time letter notification to patients and an electronic message to their physician with management suggestions , including facilitated allergy referral for patients without prior asthma specialist care ."
14771,METHODS,The control group received this organization 's standard asthma care management without research contact .
14772,METHODS,Frequency of the seventh SABA canister dispensing in the follow-up year was the primary outcome .
14773,RESULTS,"Compared with controls , intervention patients reached 7 SABA canister dispensings less frequently ( 50.7 % vs 57.1 % ; risk ratio 0.89 [ 95 % CI , 0.82-0 .97 ] ; P = .007 ) and later ( hazard ratio 0.80 [ 95 % CI , 0.71-0 .91 ; P < .001 ) ."

14779,OBJECTIVE,"To minimize stent-related symptoms , the proximal part of the Polaris stent is composed of a firm material and its distal part is composed of a soft material ."
14780,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to compare stent-related symptoms of Polaris and Percuflex stents and to assess the impacts of these stents on quality of life .
14781,METHODS,A total of 144 patients were randomized to a `` test '' group ( Polaris ; n = 64 ) or a `` conventional '' group ( Percuflex ; n = 80 ) at the time of ureteral stent insertion after ureteroscopic stone removal surgery .

14819,OBJECTIVE,"We aimed to explore the specific effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) for urban youth by comparing it with an active control program , designed to control for time , positive peer-group experience , and positive adult instructor ."
14820,METHODS,Patients between the ages of 13-21 years who received primary pediatric care at our urban outpatient clinic were eligible for study participation .
14821,METHODS,"Those who were interested were consented and randomly assigned to an eight-week program of MBSR or Healthy Topics ( HT ) , a health education curriculum ."
14822,METHODS,"To increase sensitivity to outcomes of interest , mixed methods were used to assess psychological symptoms , coping , and program experience ."
14823,METHODS,"Analysis of variance and regression modeling were used ; interviews were audio-taped , transcribed , and coded for key themes ."
14824,RESULTS,"A total of 43 ( 26 MBSR , 17 HT ) youths attended one or more sessions , of whom 35 [ 20 MBSR ( 77 % ) , 15 HT ( 88 % ) ] attended the majority of the sessions and were considered completers ."
14825,RESULTS,"Program completers were African American , 80 % female , with average age of 15.0 years ."
14826,RESULTS,Statistical analysis of survey data did not identify significant post-program differences between groups .
14827,RESULTS,"Qualitative data show comparable positive experiences in both programs , but specific differences related to MBSR participants use of mindfulness techniques to calm down and avoid conflicts , as well as descriptions of internal processes and self-regulation ."
14828,CONCLUSIONS,"Compared with an active control program , MBSR did not result in statistically significant differences in self-reported survey outcomes of interest but was associated with qualitative outcomes of increased calm , conflict avoidance , self-awareness , and self-regulation for urban youths ."
14829,CONCLUSIONS,"Importantly , based on qualitative results , the HT program functioned as an effective active control for MBSR in this sample , facilitating a more rigorous methodological approach to MBSR research in this population ."
14830,CONCLUSIONS,We believe the promising effects elucidated in the qualitative data have the potential for positive affective and behavioral outcomes .
14831,BACKGROUND,"Plyometric exercise has been recommended to prevent lower limb injury , but its feasibility in and effects on those with functional ankle instability ( FAI ) are unclear ."
14832,OBJECTIVE,To investigate the effect of integrated plyometric and balance training in participants with FAI during a single-legged drop landing and single-legged standing position .
14833,METHODS,Randomized controlled clinical trial .

14855,OBJECTIVE,To study the relative contribution of a mirror in training a reaching task and of unilateral and bimanual training with a mirror .
14856,METHODS,A total of 93 stroke patients at least 6 months poststroke were instructed to perform a reaching task as fast and as fluently as possible .
14857,METHODS,"They performed 70 practice trials after being randomly allocated to 1 of 5 experimental groups : training with ( 1 ) the paretic arm with direct view ( Paretic-No Mirror ) , ( 2 ) the nonparetic arm with direct view ( Nonparetic-No Mirror ) , ( 3 ) the nonparetic arm with mirror reflection ( Nonparetic Mirror ) , ( 4 ) both sides and with a nontransparent screen preventing visual control of paretic side ( Bilateral-Screen ) , and ( 5 ) both sides with mirror reflection of the nonparetic arm ( Bilateral-Mirror ) ."
14858,METHODS,"As baseline and follow-up , patients performed 6 trials using only their paretic side ."
14859,METHODS,Primary outcome measure was the movement time .
14860,RESULTS,We found the largest intervention effect in the Paretic-No Mirror condition .
14861,RESULTS,"However , the Nonparetic-Mirror condition was not significantly different from the Paretic-No Mirror condition , while the Unaffected-No Mirror condition had significantly less improvement than the Paretic-No Mirror condition ."
14862,RESULTS,"In addition , movement time improved significantly less in the bimanual conditions and there was no difference between both bimanual conditions or between both mirror conditions ."
14863,CONCLUSIONS,The present study confirms that using a mirror reflection can facilitate motor learning .
14864,CONCLUSIONS,"In this task , bimanual movement using mirror training was less effective than unilateral training ."
14865,OBJECTIVE,To examine the relationships between parental patterns regarding child feeding and child body mass index ( BMI ) percentile in Latino parent-preschooler dyads participating in a clinical trial .
14866,METHODS,"This secondary analysis examined data collected during a randomized clinical trial of a culturally tailored healthy lifestyle intervention focused on childhood obesity prevention , Salud Con La Familia ."
14867,METHODS,"We analyzed 77 Latino parent-child dyads who completed baseline and 3-month follow-up data collection , assessing associations between preschool child BMI percentile and parental response to the Child Feeding Questionnaire ( CFQ ) over time ."
14868,RESULTS,"Higher child BMI was related to higher parental CFQ concern scores ( r = 0.41 , p < .001 ) ."
14869,RESULTS,"A general inverse association between child BMI percentile and parental responsibility was also observed ( r = -0.23 , p = .040 ) ."
14870,RESULTS,"Over the 3-month period , no statistically significant associations between changes in the CFQ subscale scores and changes in child BMI percentile were identified ."
14871,CONCLUSIONS,Child BMI percentile consistent with overweight/obese is associated with parental concern about child weight and child BMI percentile consistent with normal weight is associated with perceived responsibility for feeding .
14872,CONCLUSIONS,Emphasizing parental responsibility to help children to develop healthy eating habits could be an important aspect of interventions aimed at both preventing and reducing pediatric obesity for Latino preschoolers .
14873,OBJECTIVE,"A randomized , crossover , double-blinded placebo-controlled and non-blinded active drug-controlled , comparative clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sublingual fentanyl tablet ."

14881,RESULTS,"Adverse reactions were observed in 17.6 % , the most common being constipation , nausea and somnolence ."
14882,RESULTS,The incidence of adverse reactions during the high-dose administration period was higher than that during the low-dose and active control drug administration periods .
14883,CONCLUSIONS,Patients treated with strong opioid analgesics at fixed intervals for chronic cancer pain and with oral morphine at doses up to 20 mg as rescue medication were investigated .
14884,CONCLUSIONS,The doses of sublingual fentanyl to treat breakthrough pain were determined from rescue morphine doses by use of conversion ratios .
14885,CONCLUSIONS,"In these patients , administration of sublingual fentanyl at doses determined by a conversion ratio of 1/50 was effective and safe ."
14886,CONCLUSIONS,Further studies are needed to validate the use of this conversion method .
