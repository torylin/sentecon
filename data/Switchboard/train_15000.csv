0,A,Okay.
1,A,"So, What kind of experience do you, do you have, then with child care?"
2,B,"I guess, I think, uh, I wonder if that worked."
3,A,Does it say something?
4,B,I think it usually does.
5,B,"You might try, uh,"
6,B,"I don't know,"
7,B,"hold it down a little longer,"
8,B,"and see if it, uh,"
9,A,Okay
10,A,"Well, Does it usually make a recording or"
11,B,Okay
12,B,"I, Well, I don't remember."
13,B,"It seemed like it did,"
14,B,but it might not.
15,B,"I guess I guess we can start. Uh,"
16,A,Okay.
17,A,Okay.
18,B,"No,"
19,B,"I don't, I don't have any kids."
20,B,"I, uh, my sister has a, she just had a baby,"
21,B,he's about five months old
22,B,"and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different,"
23,A,Uh-huh.
24,B,do you have kids?
25,A,I have three.
26,B,"Oh, really?"
27,A,Uh-huh.
28,A,"Yeah,"
29,A,I do
30,A,"Yes, uh,"
31,A,"I don't work, though,"
32,A,"but I used to work and, when I had two children."
33,B,Uh-huh.
34,A,"I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit,"
35,A,but I don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care.
36,B,Yeah.
37,A,"But, does your sister live in a big community?"
38,B,"Uh, yeah"
39,B,"she lives,"
40,B,"it's a, it's a fairly large community."
41,B,"She, uh, got real lucky, though."
42,B,"He had a boss who, uh, moved into a larger office"
43,A,Uh-huh.
44,B,and she's able to take her baby to work with her.
45,A,"Oh, really?"
46,B,And it's a small office that she works in
47,A,Uh-huh.
48,B,"and, uh, it's a, it's a legal firm, office,"
49,B,and it's just one lawyer
50,A,Um.
51,B,and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office.
52,B,There's no one else that works there.
53,A,Uh-huh.
54,B,"And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby,"
55,B,so it works out pretty good for her.
56,A,Wow.
57,A,How lucky
58,A,"I, I know a lot of people around here sometimes have, like, mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids"
59,B,Yeah.
60,A,"and, but, the community I'm in is not a real large one,"
61,A,"so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that, you know,"
62,A,"you either know them or know somebody who knows them to get to,"
63,B,"Yeah,"
64,B,so it's fairly safe.
65,A,"Yeah,"
66,A,"to get references and that,"
67,A,"so, but, uh,"
68,A,"I, I don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center, but, simply because there's so many kids and so many"
69,B,Worried that they're not going to get enough attention?
70,A,"Yeah,"
71,A,"and, uh, you know, colds and things like that get spread real easy and things,"
72,B,Yeah.
73,A,"but, and they're expensive"
74,A,"and, course, there's a lot of different types of day care available, too, you know, where they teach them academic things."
75,B,Yes.
76,A,"Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that,"
77,A,"but,"
78,A,take a long time to find the right place
79,B,"Yeah,"
80,B,"and you, and you don't always even know if it's, it's going to be the right place or not."
81,A,Uh-huh.
82,B,"Anything, I guess, could happen."
83,A,Uh-huh.
84,B,"Because after, I guess after he, you know, gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care."
85,A,"Uh-huh,"
86,A,when he starts toddling around and stuff.
87,B,Yeah.
88,A,Yeah.
89,B,"When, when he's not, when she can't keep control of him"
90,B,and he starts crawling
91,B,"that's,"
92,A,Uh-huh.
93,A,"It would be hard,"
94,A,I think it would be kind of stressful.
95,A,It would be nice to have him around
96,B,Uh-huh.
97,A,"but, uh, seems like, you know,"
98,A,what if he cried at the wrong time
99,A,"or the phone rang or, you know, at the wrong time"
100,B,Yeah.
101,A,"But,"
102,B,"I think she has problems with that, too."
103,A,Uh-huh.
104,A,"Well, when you have kids, will you work?"
105,A,Do you work now?
106,B,I don't know
107,B,"that's something I've considered. Uh,"
108,A,Uh-huh.
109,B,I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time.
110,A,Uh-huh.
111,B,Is that what you do?
112,A,"Uh, yeah."
113,A,"Actually, I teach my kids at home,"
114,A,so I'm here all the time.
115,B,"Oh, so they don't go to school."
116,B,"Is it like, uh,"
117,B,"oh, what's that called,"
118,B,"it's, uh, correspondence school,"
119,B,they do it at home.
120,A,Uh-huh.
121,A,"Yeah,"
122,A,yeah.
123,B,That's interesting.
124,A,"So,"
125,B,Do you have to have any special training?
126,A,"Not,"
127,A,it depends on the state you live actually.
128,A,Some laws absolutely prohibit it.
129,A,"Some states, uh, say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that."
130,A,"Our state doesn't yet, say that"
131,A,and I'm not a certified teacher.
132,A,"I went to college,"
133,A,"but I, you know, but my kids are only elementary grades, levels right now"
134,A,"and so,"
135,B,So they haven't been to public schools at all.
136,A,One of them was for a couple of years
137,A,"and so, you know, my oldest, he was,"
138,A,and then my youngest two have never been.
139,B,Um.
140,A,"So anyway,"
141,A,"but we don't,"
142,B,"So, you've never had,"
143,A,"Well, uh, does the company you work for test for drugs?"
144,B,"Actually, uh, they just recently started a policy of testing drugs, which was kind of interesting,"
145,B,"because when I went to work for them, uh, they didn't do that,"
146,B,"but, uh, since then they've, they've started a drug testing policy, not because of their own, uh, convictions, but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that."
147,A,Huh.
148,B,How about you?
149,A,"Uh, no,"
150,A,"we're not being tested for drugs at all, uh,"
151,A,"our policies and procedures manual, uh, the furthest it goes about drugs is in the, kind of the miscellaneous section, or it's reasons for immediate dismissal,"
152,B,Uh-huh.
153,A,"it says, use of narcotics on company premises."
154,B,Um.
155,A,"So that's pretty general,"
156,A,"but, uh, I work for an environmental management firm"
157,B,Okay.
158,A,"and I'm an engineer there,"
159,A,"but I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites,"
160,A,but I don't operate any machinery.
161,B,Yeah.
162,A,"Now, people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a, a medical monitoring program,"
163,B,Uh-huh.
164,A,because they're at a higher risk of exposure
165,A,and blood screening is part of that
166,A,"and I, I think that drugs,"
167,A,"they do test for drugs in that capacity,"
168,A,"but it's not their exclusive,"
169,A,"it's just part, it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for."
170,B,Yeah.
171,A,But I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field.
172,A,What is the nature of your company's business?
173,B,"Well, it's actually, uh,"
174,B,we do oil well services.
175,B,"So, a lot of our clients are oil companies, big oil companies,"
176,B,"and they go out to,"
177,B,"we have engineers who, uh, go out to the oil well, to the, to the client's oil well, and, and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff,"
178,B,"so the clients are very concerned that, you know, the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy, because they're on their, their, you know, territory and everything,"
179,B,"but the thing that's interesting is that I I'm an engineer and, a software engineer"
180,A,Um.
181,B,"and I work in the software, uh, house,"
182,B,"and everybody there, you know, are all software engineers."
183,B,"They've never, you know, they never go out to the, the oil rigs or anything,"
184,B,"and yet, we're getting, we're subjected to this policy, you know, the same one that, uh, all the engineers have to, to,"
185,B,"well, a little different, actually,"
186,B,"but, uh, you know, we have to go through the same thing,"
187,B,"and it's, but it's, uh, it's a little different, I guess than than a lot of drug policies."
188,B,"In our case, it's like, when you hire on, they'll test you,"
189,B,"and then if you get injured on the job, if you like trip and fall or something, uh, they give you a drug test right away."
190,A,"Oh, really?"
191,B,"Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that,"
192,B,"but, a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first."
193,B,"Particularly, like uh, we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol,"
194,B,"and they didn't find any problem with that, you know,"
195,B,"but,"
196,A,Right.
197,B,"Uh,"
198,A,"We, that's been an, a, an issue, uh, in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening."
199,A,"they'll have these little parties,"
200,A,"and people will just get,"
201,A,"I mean, I've,"
202,A,"my brother lives where I work,"
203,A,"and I have many a time called him to come get me, you know."
204,A,"And, uh, uh, but, you know, they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg. You know,"
205,B,Yeah
206,A,"but, uh, I think drug testing,"
207,A,"and I, I don't know,"
208,A,"I guess I I think it's got some relevance,"
209,A,but I think its relevance is pretty limited.
210,A,"I mean, I think, you know,"
211,A,"in your case, I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing."
212,B,Yeah.
213,A,I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident.
214,B,"Yeah,"
215,B,"it's really, it's really bizarre."
216,B,"Uh, particularly, like where we are, you know."
217,B,"I, I,"
218,B,"there was a story of a woman last year who, who actually did slip on the ice and, and like sprained her ankle"
219,B,"and she, she was a personnel secretary"
220,B,and she had to get tested
221,B,"and, I don't know"
222,B,I'm ambivalent about the whole thing.
223,B,"I, you know, I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand, it's like if, you know,"
224,B,"they're, they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense"
225,B,"and, you know, it's like you're, I mean, employments are contractual by nature anyway"
226,A,Uh-huh.
227,B,"but, uh, I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that, where I had to, uh, uh, do a drug test"
228,B,"and, and it's, it was kind of a long story,"
229,B,"but it was, it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through,"
230,B,"and it amounted to, uh, going in, uh, before any of these interviews,"
231,B,"I'm not even working for this company,"
232,B,"I'm going in for, like, interviews"
233,B,and they flew me out to Chicago
234,B,"and, and, uh, before I went into any of the interviews, uh, they took me to the doctor to give me a physical."
235,B,"They said it was going to be a physical, you know,"
236,B,"and, uh, actually beforehand they told me they were going to, uh, do drug screening,"
237,B,"but I had forgotten about that,"
238,B,"and so, basically, I'd already peed off that morning"
239,B,"and, and when I got in there, I didn't, I wasn't, like, able to give a full sample,"
240,B,"and so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes, drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again,"
241,A,Oh.
242,A,Right.
243,B,"and the, and the, the procedure is utterly humiliating."
244,B,"You go in there with the doctor,"
245,B,he makes you take off all your clothes
246,B,and then he examines you.
247,A,"Uh, the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a, uh, long term financial plan and monthly budget."
248,A,"The only thing I do now is, uh, put the data into Quicken."
249,A,I don't know if you are familiar with that.
250,B,"Yeah,"
251,B,I have some friends of mine who use Quicken
252,B,"and, uh, I've considered using it once myself,"
253,B,but I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date.
254,A,Uh-huh.
255,B,"So I, I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken, at least for now."
256,A,"Um. I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then, well, uh, uh, not bother to total it"
257,B,Uh-huh.
258,A,and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic.
259,A,So it really helps with that.
260,B,"Yeah,"
261,B,"well, it's similar problems"
262,B,"but, uh, we just have the one check book"
263,B,and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible
264,B,and occasionally we will get behind like you say
265,B,"but, uh, it doesn't really seem to be too, too tight if we just remember to keep everything up, up to date and balanced."
266,A,Uh-huh.
267,B,"Well, how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on finances?"
268,A,"Well, actually we haven't had to. Uh, until just recently."
269,A,"I guess we've got a, a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way"
270,A,"so we needed to start doing more of that just for, uh, you know, saving for college and things like that."
271,B,Uh-huh.
272,A,"We tried a way, try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that."
273,B,Yeah.
274,B,Well that's pretty good if you can do that.
275,B,I know.
276,B,I have a daughter who's ten
277,B,and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point
278,B,"but, uh, we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college,"
279,A,Uh-huh.
280,B,so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall
281,A,Um.
282,B,and then the money that I will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund.
283,A,Um. Sounds good.
284,A,"Yeah,"
285,A,"I guess we're, we're just at the point, uh,"
286,A,my wife worked until we had a family
287,A,"and then, you know, now we're just going on the one income"
288,A,"so it's a lot more interesting trying to, uh,"
289,B,Uh-huh.
290,A,"find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to, uh, do it."
291,A,"You know, kind of enforce the savings."
292,B,Uh-huh.
293,A,"But, uh, it will be interesting to see"
294,B,"Well our situation is just a little bit, kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently, uh, took on a full time job, well almost full time."
295,A,Um.
296,B,"So, it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for, uh, long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing."
297,A,Um.
298,A,That sounds good.
299,A,"But, uh, uh, I was just curious, what, uh, part of the country."
300,B,"Oh, Stockton."
301,A,"Oh, okay."
302,B,How about you?
303,A,"Uh, Cincinnati, actually."
304,A,"I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with, uh, the western accents or something like that."
305,A,"I don't know how many people are, uh, getting involved in this"
306,A,"but uh, well that's interesting."
307,B,Uh-huh.
308,A,"I'm, uh, uh, actually, uh, I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by, uh, reading TELECOM DIGEST"
309,A,or was there another?
310,B,"Uh, a colleague of mine at, uh, work got some information over, uh, the computer network called INTERNET."
311,A,"Oh, okay."
312,A,"Yeah,"
313,A,that is how I got it as well
314,A,"but, uh,"
315,B,And he just forwarded that on to me
316,B,"and, uh, it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in"
317,A,Uh-huh.
318,B,so I sent back mail.
319,A,"Yeah,"
320,A,"it will be interesting to see what, It would be interesting to see how the data base,"
321,A,"so, well, I guess we're talking about the experiment."
322,B,Uh-huh.
323,A,"Uh, probably need to try to get back on the topic"
324,A,"but, uh, it's hard to talk about finances without without getting to, uh, dollar figures I guess you know,"
325,B,Uh-huh.
326,A,we could talk about some of the long range goals
327,A,"and,"
328,B,Well what other long range goals do you have besides college?
329,A,"Uh, well I think, either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point"
330,B,Uh-huh.
331,A,"uh, I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that."
332,A,"It seems like every year my employer just gives back, you know, a little bit your tuition reimbursement."
333,B,Uh-huh.
334,A,I mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent
335,A,"and now it's, uh, now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class"
336,A,"and, uh, it's a real shame from what we had before, uh, because we're,"
337,A,"Right,"
338,A,"uh, actually I lived over in Europe for a couple of years,"
339,A,I lived in Germany
340,A,and in Germany they don't have the jury system.
341,A,"What they do is they have, uh, three judges, basically."
342,A,And you get up there
343,A,and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence
344,A,and your defense attorney presents their evidence
345,A,"and those three guys take the evidence, go off, figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not."
346,B,our judicial system is in such total chaos.
347,B,"I think what they need to do is, they need to somehow take the money out of it."
348,B,"I mean, when you have a man that's signed a, a, a statement saying he's guilty,"
349,B,"we have a, a family called All day family."
350,B,They were all murdered.
351,A,Uh-huh.
352,B,"All the people signed confessions,"
353,B,they went to a trial by jury.
354,B,"They been trying these people now for twenty-two years, ever since I was a child."
355,A,Wow.
356,B,"And what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done,"
357,B,has nothing to do with justice whatsoever.
358,A,"Well, you know, it's, it's one of those things,"
359,A,"I mean, uh, uh, I would have to look at it."
360,A,"if they did it with the, uh, just the judges, the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight"
361,A,"because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day, they know all the procedures,"
362,A,"they know what's good and what isn't,"
363,A,"they'd be able to say, I'm sorry,"
364,A,"you can't use this as, uh, evidence, you know, because it was either illegally obtained or whatever"
365,A,"and, you know, you wouldn't have this, uh, uh, theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the, to the jury"
366,A,"and then the judge says, oh, no,"
367,A,disregard that.
368,A,"Come on,"
369,A,"any jury's not going to disregard the evidence, you know"
370,B,"Uh, that's true."
371,B,"I, I, I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself."
372,A,That may very well be.
373,B,"I, I hold it in the utmost contempt."
374,A,"Uh,"
375,B,"The, uh, my favorite is the police department,"
376,B,they're not aimed at the criminal.
377,B,The judicial system is aimed at the citizens
378,B,"because you and I, we have work schedules,"
379,B,"we can be called at work,"
380,B,"we have Social Security numbers,"
381,B,"they can trace us down,"
382,B,"we have telephones,"
383,B,then we have checkbooks.
384,B,Criminals have none of these things.
385,B,"They're real difficult to catch,"
386,B,"and if they do catch them, they don't get any monetary gain out of it, whereas us, we write a check."
387,A,Yeah.
388,B,So where do you think they target their efforts?
389,A,That's true.
390,B,They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals.
391,A,"Well, How would you go about changing it?"
392,B,"You know, that's a,"
393,B,I've nailed the problem down
394,B,"but I,"
395,A,"Leave the details up to somebody else, huh."
396,B,"Yeah,"
397,B,"I'm going to have to leave those details like, what would you do about,"
398,B,"I think, to begin with, you would you would have,"
399,B,"like, here in Atlanta area, our crime rate is just astronomical,"
400,B,"yet, you go out on the streets"
401,B,and they're giving speeding tickets.
402,A,Yeah.
403,B,"I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from,"
404,A,"Well, you know, uh, talking about the lawyers, you know what might very well do, uh, cause a, uh, a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that, is to set the fees for cases."
405,A,"It's kind of like do it, do it in the similar vein similar, like, uh, V C R or television repair."
406,A,"If you take your T V in, a lot of these T V repair places will say, well, I'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars,"
407,A,"and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it, then he eats it."
408,A,"He, he repairs it, gives it back to you, and takes your hundred dollars."
409,A,"Now, if he comes in and says, you know, I'll repair your, your V C R, or somebody else's V C R, for a hundred dollars, gets in there,"
410,A,"maybe it's a blown fuse,"
411,A,"takes him two minutes,"
412,A,"he fixes it,"
413,A,he still charges you that hundred dollars.
414,A,"So, maybe if we did that with the lawyers, so that, you know, whether it's a murder case or a, you know, a civil, uh, somebody suing somebody else, you get X dollars for that case"
415,A,and that's it.
416,B,"Now, I firmly believe in that"
417,A,"None of this,"
418,B,"because when you get the most heinous of crimes, have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney?"
419,A,"Oh, yeah."
420,B,And here's this bum that didn't have a job
421,A,Yeah.
422,B,and he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford.
423,A,That's true.
424,B,Who's paying for that?
425,A,Yeah.
426,A,"Um, well, you, you know, you're talking to part of them that's paying for that"
427,B,"Yeah,"
428,B,and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it
429,A,That's right.
430,A,"You know that's, it, it's, it's amazing"
431,A,"and, and when you stop and look at it, I mean, the judges, they're all former lawyers."
432,B,"Yeah,"
433,B,"well, that's another problem."
434,B,"I think to really correct the judicial system, you have to get the lawyers out of it"
435,B,"I mean, they're, they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever,"
436,B,"and with that type person running it, I mean, you, you could expect that you,"
437,A,"Do you know anyone that, uh, is, is in a nursing home or has ever been in one?"
438,B,No.
439,B,"But I, my grandparents were looking into it before"
440,B,so I know what they've said.
441,A,Uh-huh.
442,B,Uh-huh.
443,A,"Well, I'm trying to think."
444,A,"My, uh, uh, wife's grandmother had Alzheimer's"
445,A,"and they were going to put her into a, a nursing home"
446,A,"and, uh, they, when they put her in, she had all kinds of trouble"
447,A,"and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a, a, you know, a, a nuisance. Or worse than a nuisance,"
448,A,"I mean  she sort of went, you know, bananas"
449,B,they thought it was too much of a bother.
450,A,"and they couldn't, couldn't deal with her"
451,A,"So, I guess you need to, uh, know whether it's a, you know, a no deposit, no return kind of thing whether"
452,B,Right.
453,B,"If they're equipped too, to handle the kind of patients you're going to have you know, put in there too."
454,A,Yeah.
455,B,Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still.
456,A,Right.
457,B,They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her
458,B,but they wanted to be independent as well. Have their own room.
459,A,Right.
460,A,"My grandmother actually was in a, a nursing home that, uh,"
461,A,"there was a retirement hotel and then a, uh,"
462,A,there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it
463,A,"so for, uh, the first few years she had her own apartment and, you know, made her own meals sometimes. But could, could also go and eat someplace else."
464,B,Uh-huh.
465,A,"And then, uh, as she became less able to take care of herself, then she moved into this other part that was able to, uh, provide full-time care"
466,A,"and, uh, she didn't have to do anything anymore."
467,A,But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly.
468,A,And that's
469,A,"I don't know whether that's because they, you know, sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the, the reason is."
470,A,But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something.
471,B,Well a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help.
472,A,Yeah.
473,B,They need health care
474,B,so they're already ill before they go.
475,A,Right.
476,B,That's probably a large factor.
477,A,Yeah.
478,A,"If, if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you, then you stay where you are."
479,A,Then you only go there as a last resort.
480,B,Uh-huh.
481,A,Or people send you there as a last resort.
482,B,"Right,"
483,B,right.
484,B,"That's what my grandparents,"
485,B,"it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened, there was somebody there for them."
486,A,Uh-huh.
487,B,So that was their thinking.
488,B,Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency.
489,A,Right.
490,B,And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make. So they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time.
491,A,Right.
492,B,I guess that's a problem too for people. Wait lists and all.
493,A,"Yeah,"
494,A,I guess.
495,B,"That, uh,"
496,B,you can't always get in when you want too
497,B,"and of course, you can't just sit around and wait."
498,A,Right.
499,A,"When you need it, you need it  I guess."
500,B,Yeah.
501,B,And the money is also another issue. How you're going to pay for it.
502,A,Right.
503,B,At that stage of life you only have so much money left
504,B,and I guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings.
505,A,Yeah.
506,B,"I mean it is kind of fair,"
507,B,but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise.
508,A,Sure.
509,B,So it's another problem.
510,A,"And you probably, if it were you, you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price."
511,B,"Right,"
512,B,right.
513,B,"So, it, it's just so complicated anymore, I think"
514,B,People outlive their savings.
515,B,"And, with medicine being the way it is, you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down"
516,B,and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore.
517,A,Yeah.
518,A,Well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing.
519,B,It's just a shame that's the way it has to be.
520,B,I think  the retirement home idea's a nice idea. To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay
521,A,Yeah.
522,B,"and cause like if your spouse died, all alone, it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you. To have friends."
523,A,Right.
524,A,"Yeah,"
525,A,"I've known quite a few people that have, uh, gone to retirement communities."
526,A,I don't know if they have them back there
527,A,but here in California and in
528,B,Okay.
529,A,"Uh, so, what do you think, uh, about putting the elderly in a nursing home?"
530,B,"Well, I think that it, it varies on on the individual basis."
531,A,Huh.
532,B,"Uh, sometimes it is, there is no alternative."
533,A,Uh-huh
534,B,"Uh, you do not have, uh, uh, family available or family that's, uh,"
535,B,"you may not even have family that is, uh, uh, in, you know, who are around."
536,A,That's true.
537,A,Yeah.
538,B,"So, sometimes it's not an alternative."
539,A,Huh
540,B,"And I think, uh, but I think also, sometimes it can be, uh, a benefit if it's for a short time."
541,B,Sometimes in a nursing home
542,A,Uh-huh.
543,B,"uh, especially if, if it's after an acute illness."
544,B,"To get over a,"
545,B,"or to rehab after, uh, an illness."
546,A,That's true.
547,A,I never thought of that.
548,A,Yeah.
549,B,"Sometimes you know, sometimes the nursing homes are good for, uh, just short periods of time."
550,A,"That's true,"
551,A,until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with.
552,B,Uh-huh.
553,B,"Because too often the acute hospitals will, are sending them out much faster than what they're really able to."
554,A,Yes.
555,A,They really are.
556,A,They don't like to keep them longer than a week.
557,B,So so there is some good to it.
558,A,Yeah.
559,B,"Uh, sometimes too, it's used as a dumb job."
560,B,"You know the well the families do not necessarily uh, know what to do with them"
561,A,What do you mean?
562,B,and they don't want to take the responsibility
563,B,so they will put them in a nursing home.
564,A,"Yeah,"
565,A,that's true.
566,B,"So you see, uh,"
567,B,there's both sides to it too.
568,B,What do you think?
569,A,Yeah
570,A,"and it depends on how, how sick the person is too. What you're capable of, like if you have a family to take care of, you know, of your own"
571,B,Yeah.
572,A,"Yeah,"
573,A,"uh, I would personally like it"
574,A,"if my parents were to get ill, I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help."
575,A,That's not always possible.
576,B,That's true.
577,A,"But, uh, to the best of my ability, I'd like to do it until it gets impossible"
578,B,"I think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to,"
579,B,"it's there's not a choice, it's  because, it's not economically feasible even to  put them in a nursing home."
580,A,Right.
581,A,Uh-huh
582,A,Yeah.
583,B,"So that, that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the, uh, either Medicare or insurance to cover it."
584,A,That's true.
585,A,Yeah.
586,B,"So,"
587,A,But I think nursing homes can be good.
588,A,It just depends on what kind they are.
589,A,"You know, you need to check them out ahead of time."
590,B,"Yeah,"
591,B,and then there's also some that are set up for specialties
592,A,Uh-huh.
593,B,"uh, I know some."
594,B,"Unfortunately, some elderly have to go to or have, I guess it's Alzheimer's or where  they wonder or, or, uh, confused or have some mental problem"
595,A,Uh-huh.
596,A,"Yeah,"
597,A,that they're
598,B,And you need a special nursing home for that.
599,B,You need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around
600,A,Yeah.
601,B,and you need people who are trained for that type  of problem.
602,A,Right.
603,A,Who know what they're doing with that.
604,B,Yeah
605,B,"so, so there's different types of nursing homes I think."
606,A,Yeah
607,A,"well, my, uh, grandmother's not really in a nursing home, but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it."
608,A,"And she really liked the idea of, of moving there."
609,A,She's not ill yet
610,B,Uh-huh.
611,A,"but, uh, she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years"
612,A,"and then she decided that, uh, she's eighty five years old, that eventually, you know, she she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden."
613,A,She's very independent.
614,A,So she's in this nursing home.
615,A,It's out in the country
616,A,"and, uh, she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook"
617,B,Gives her a little bit of her own independence
618,A,Uh-huh.
619,B,"but she still has, uh, a security there."
620,A,Right.
621,A,Some support.
622,A,"And then there's also, uh, sort of a wing for those people that do get sick"
623,A,"and, what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now"
624,A,"and then, so if she ever does become ill, uh, it will be like family around her."
625,B,That's right
626,B,and I  I've seen some of them like that too
627,A,Yeah.
628,B,"and also they have a lot of, uh, activities going on for the ones  who are more active."
629,A,Uh-huh
630,A,Yeah.
631,B,"So it's not sort of like, uh, uh  a sick place."
632,A,Uh-huh
633,A,"No,"
634,A,she loves it.
635,A,She has a great social life
636,A,and she travels
637,A,"and, uh, it's in, in the in the mountains"
638,A,and it's beautiful
639,A,"and, uh, I, I hope that I have something like that when I get older"
640,B,Yeah
641,B,"I, I think, I think the, uh I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the, uh, elderly uh, person who's going in and the family that's going to be, uh, effected by it"
642,A,Uh-huh
643,A,Uh-huh.
644,A,"Oh definitely it's,"
645,B,"and, uh, you know, sometimes it can, those those choices can be made in advance"
646,B,"and sometimes  the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're,"
647,A,Right.
648,A,"So, uh, do you happen to be working for a large firm?"
649,B,"Well, it's about three hundred and fifty people."
650,B,"I guess that's not large compared to some,"
651,B,but it's big enough.
652,A,Uh-huh.
653,B,"And they have a, they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything"
654,B,and I wish they did.
655,A,Yeah.
656,B,"You know, they have a four O one K,"
657,B,but I put all the money into it.
658,A,Uh-huh.
659,B,They don't add anything.
660,B,What about you?
661,A,"Uh, I work for a fairly large company."
662,A,It's got eight thousand people.
663,B,Uh-huh.
664,A,"And, uh, we do have health insurance."
665,A,"We don't have four O one K plan, stuff like that,"
666,A,"but we do have, like, retirement."
667,A,"They kind of match up to, you,"
668,A,"if you put six percent, they match up to six percent,"
669,A,and then the rest is whatever you want to put in. If you put more than that or something like that.
670,B,"Oh, that's a pretty good deal."
671,A,It's not bad.
672,B,"Now, how long does it take for your contribution to vest?"
673,A,"God, I don't know."
674,A,It's probably a long time
675,A,"I'm sure it's not till like twenty-five years, thirty years."
676,B,"Yeah,"
677,B,"the place I work at's, health insurance is kind of expensive."
678,B,"It's like hundred bucks a, a month or something for a family."
679,A,Yeah.
680,A,"Huh, well, I guess what we have is like a what they call a flex benefits plan where you, you get like a certain amount of dollars"
681,A,and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need.
682,A,"Otherwise you can, uh, guess you can put, also put money, hold money back and then either use or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or can just have that money, you know, put in your paycheck."
683,B,"Yeah,"
684,B,"we have one of those use it or lose it plans, too, where, uh, they'll basically pay for, uh, you know, child care type, uh, expenses."
685,B,"I can send in a, uh, can send in a request for payment"
686,B,"and they'll, uh, and they'll send me, a check for the amount they withheld."
687,B,"That's pretty good, you know."
688,B,"It's, uh, it saves a third off on taxes or something."
689,A,Yeah
690,A,"well, it depends on which company you work for."
691,A,"I know that, like, the, the, the one plan that everyone seems to be in, in my place is, uh, you know, you, uh, think you call it plan D"
692,A,"another example like I guess it's alzheimer's Deductibles are really high,"
693,A,"it's like fifteen hundred dollars,"
694,A,"but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because it's unlikely, if you're relatively, uh, healthy, then it's really unlikely that you'd use that much, amount of money, you know."
695,A,"So, it, someone did start a cost benefit analysis,"
696,A,"and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and, and take a loss, whatever happens to be, if you happen to be a healthy individual"
697,B,"Yeah,"
698,B,"I guess,"
699,B,"uh, on the other hand, you know, I, I had a similar, had a similar health plan"
700,B,"and, uh, one of my kids was in a car accident"
701,B,"and, uh I had, wound up having to pay for, you know, a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of, you know, no, no insurance policy happened to cover it, which is,"
702,A,Um.
703,A,Really?
704,A,"You mean, not even your, your, your car insurance?"
705,B,"Well, it, it got all screwed up because I had a high deductible on the health insurance, no fault here,"
706,B,"and, and I had a high deductible on the on the, uh, on the car insurance"
707,B,"and then you know, we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and blew it"
708,A,"Oh, that's too bad."
709,B,"Oh, well."
710,A,Yeah
711,A,"uh, well, I don't know,"
712,A,"I think other than health insurance, I think, uh, you know, an extra week of, uh, time off would be nice."
713,A,I only get two weeks.
714,B,"Yeah,"
715,B,yeah
716,B,my place you get two weeks when you start
717,B,"and then every, every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks."
718,A,"Oh, that's nice."
719,A,"We don't get them till, till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week."
720,B,Aye.
721,B,That's a long time.
722,A,"Yeah,"
723,A,"it's, uh,"
724,B,"Yeah,"
725,B,"especially in the kind of engineering job I'm in, you know, companies don't stay afloat that long"
726,B,"and, and they,"
727,A,"Uh, with the telecommunications type of company, supposedly you, used to be much more stable."
728,A,It's a lot less stable than it used to be.
729,A,They used to have job security
730,A,but now they don't.
731,B,So you work for Bell or something like that?
732,A,"Yeah,"
733,A,"it's the Bell Corps, which is, uh,"
734,B,Right.
735,A,Yeah.
736,B,Right.
737,A,"So, I don't know,"
738,A,"it's, it's, uh, no longer"
739,A,"So that's what,"
740,A,"I think it's still based on the old model of,"
741,A,"and, and now they don't, uh,"
742,B,A lifelong job security
743,B,"telephone pioneers of America,"
744,A,Yeah.
745,B,"all that stuff, huh."
746,A,"Yeah,"
747,A,"but they, no, no longer"
748,A,I don't think so.
749,B,Right.
750,A,"Uh, hearing a"
751,A,"there's always, they're always laying people off, which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security."
752,B,"Is it, I mean, does it,"
753,B,"they must have pretty good severance, though, huh?"
754,A,"Oh, I don't know,"
755,A,"we don't, we haven't been doing layoffs."
756,A,"We've been doing, uh, down sizing with, uh, getting rid of extra layers of management."
757,A,"And, uh, I don't know what they do for those people."
758,B,"Mean the, the, the management they get rid of?"
759,A,"Some of it,"
760,A,yeah.
761,B,Um.
762,A,"There's too many manage, too many chiefs and not enough Indians"
763,A,"but,"
764,B,"Oh, they, they put,"
765,A,"Well, have you ever served on a jury?"
766,B,"No,"
767,B,I've not.
768,B,"I've been called,"
769,B,but I had to beg off from the duty.
770,B,And you?
771,A,"Well, I was called"
772,A,and then I was not chosen.
773,B,Um.
774,B,"Well, I was, I was, uh, originally chosen primarily, I think, because I was a young fellow"
775,B,and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict.
776,B,I don't know why.
777,B,Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago.
778,A,"Oh, really?"
779,B,"Yeah,"
780,B,"it's that the younger they are, they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason,"
781,B,and they kind of liked me.
782,B,I looked and all that stuff
783,B,"and they,"
784,B,"I don't know what they saw in me,"
785,B,but they saw it.
786,B,"But, uh, back to the issue, is, uh,"
787,B,"I don't know,"
788,B,"at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted, especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun."
789,B,"But, there, too, there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable, particularly, I think in civil cases."
790,B,"In criminal cases, I'd like to see the unanimity remain,"
791,B,"but in civil cases, I think a majority rule by, by jury would be sufficient."
792,A,"Well, uh, could you give me an example of a case where you think that?"
793,B,"Well, in a criminal case, say one in which, you know, there is, like, say assault or some such. I think there ought to be a unanimous, uh, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this."
794,B,"And in civil law there, you know, is such a thing as like, let's say, uh, misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that."
795,B,"A majority rule, I think, would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases."
796,B,I don't know if I'm making any sense or not.
797,A,"Well, I mean, I think,"
798,A,"are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more, uh, tangible"
799,A,"or,"
800,B,"Yeah,"
801,B,often there's more incriminating evidence.
802,B,"Like, for instance, say, uh,"
803,B,"and also, too, I think I'm, I'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more, uh, serious in a criminal case."
804,A,"Well, do you think that, that in a civil case, if there was majority rule, that it would be easy for someone to be set up?"
805,B,"Um, well, I really can't say for certain, truth be known."
806,B,"Uh, as it stands, there's, there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up, both, uh, in a uh, civil and criminal case."
807,B,"I mean, the, uh, documentary, the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that."
808,B,"You know, I don't know for, if you're familiar with that or not."
809,A,"No,"
810,A,I'm not.
811,B,"A, uh, fellow when he was much younger, uh, was tried and convicted and sentenced to death."
812,B,"Fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked"
813,B,"and, uh, so he served out his, his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system."
814,B,The case was reopened
815,B,and he was exonerated.
816,A,"Well, I mean, I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served."
817,B,"Yeah,"
818,B,"many laws, but little justice."
819,A,"Say,"
820,A,"but, uh,"
821,A,"and I also think, just like you were talking about before, why you were chosen to be on a jury that, uh, the, just, the process of picking jurors is not always objective."
822,B,"Oh, certainly not,"
823,B,certainly not.
824,B,"And you know, they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this,"
825,B,but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires.
826,B,"You know, the,"
827,B,because you get up
828,B,"and, and they ask you a few questions,"
829,B,"both sides do,"
830,B,"and then you, you're either challenged which is,"
831,B,"you know, each attorney can use that as much as they like"
832,B,"or, I think it's a limit now,"
833,B,"they probably have a limit now,"
834,B,"but, they pretty much go through that,"
835,B,and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve.
836,B,"For me, it was financial hardship,"
837,B,"so. But, onto the thing, uh, I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing."
838,B,"It was always my impression that the Justice himself, or herself, had the final say."
839,A,"Okay,"
840,A,so I guess it starts recording now.
841,B,Okay.
842,A,Okay.
843,A,"I don't know, really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in."
844,A,We live in the Saginaw area.
845,B,Saginaw?
846,A,Uh-huh.
847,A,"And I'm not real familiar with, uh, anything that,"
848,A,"I,"
849,A,"fact as far as I know, the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. And, uh, or the grocery store or anything in this area,"
850,B,Really?
851,A,yeah.
852,B,The
853,B,we live in Plano
854,B,"and they started off recycling by, uh, putting the,"
855,B,"I think at each Wal-Mart, they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that, which now,"
856,B,"I guess the, uh, city is, has bought the big green trash cans"
857,B,"and, uh, we, they have a recycling truck that comes around now"
858,B,"and you separate your glass and paper and, uh, aluminum"
859,A,Uh-huh.
860,B,and you set it out
861,B,and they pick it up
862,B,"and it, it works real neat."
863,B,They seem to be having a real good response.
864,A,Really?
865,B,"So,"
866,A,That is pretty good.
867,A,"I'm, we're originally from another state"
868,A,and I know in the state we were from that they did that similar type thing.
869,A,"The city brought ought, you know, set separate trash cans"
870,A,and you separated your stuff
871,A,and you put it in there
872,A,"and they took it, you know."
873,B,"Did they, did they, like on bottles, did they give you a so many cents back for for cans"
874,A,I don't really know.
875,A,"I don't really know,"
876,A,"they, they started after we moved down here"
877,A,"and so I, I'm not really familiar."
878,B,Yeah.
879,A,"I just know that, uh, my in-laws up in, up in Oklahoma, that's how they do, you know, they pick it up,"
880,A,"but I don't know if they get a, get anything back on it"
881,A,"or, do you get money for it?"
882,B,"No,"
883,B,"I just, I noticed it"
884,B,"Iowa and other cities like that, it's a nickel per aluminum can."
885,A,Oh.
886,B,So you don't see too many thrown out around the streets. Or even bottles.
887,A,Really
888,B,"You know, all kinds of bottles they, they, they really charge people to, I guess when you purchase them and, and then when you turn them back in."
889,A,Right.
890,B,I I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel.
891,A,Right.
892,A,"And now, now most of them are throwaway."
893,B,Right.
894,B,"So, maybe that's one thing they can do."
895,A,I think now they're a lot more expensive than that.
896,A,"Uh, I bought some Cokes the other day in the the little bottles you know,"
897,B,Uh-huh.
898,A,"and I think the bottles were like, I know they were at least ten cents apiece."
899,A,"I to at home,"
900,A,"I was like, God, how much were those bottles you know?"
901,B,Yes.
902,A,"And, it was, they come in like, uh, eight and, and eight and ten packs, you know instead of six packs"
903,B,Right.
904,A,"and, uh, and they were like, it was like two dollars and something for the bottles."
905,A,"You know, I was like God Almighty,"
906,A,it costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes.
907,B,That was my brother's first job in a grocery store.
908,B,He was in the bottle area
909,A,In the
910,B,"It's pretty dangerous out there, you know, when they fall over,"
911,B,"but but it's, uh, it's quite,"
912,A,Right.
913,B,"they say that the green glass now, that there's a big glut of green the green glass,"
914,A,"Oh, really?"
915,A,Of green glass.
916,B,yeah.
917,B,It's amazing.
918,A,"Well, out in this area, they really don't have anything."
919,A,"Now, I know that like Minyard's and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores, they have like four different bins out front. Uh, different colors for different things and, and things like that,"
920,B,Uh-huh.
921,B,Right.
922,A,"but I, I do know some of these places were doing that"
923,A,and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them.
924,B,Right.
925,B,Yeah
926,B,"it's,"
927,B,"I notice the plastic have sort of faded away, the milk jugs."
928,A,Yeah.
929,B,"It, it's,"
930,B,"people just,"
931,B,"they, they really don't,"
932,B,"uh, there's too much labor involved I guess to separate the stuff."
933,A,"Yeah,"
934,A,more than it's worth.
935,B,"It's,"
936,B,"I don't know,"
937,B,"it, it can be,"
938,B,"it's not as easy selecting, you know, clean junk as they say."
939,A,Right.
940,A,"Well, who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away"
941,B,"That's right,"
942,B,that's right.
943,B,It's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher.
944,A,"Right,"
945,A,"uh, yeah."
946,B,We all do it
947,B,"Well, it was nice talking to you."
948,A,It was nice talking to you.
949,A,I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything.
950,B,"Oh, I think, I think two or three minutes is fine."
951,A,Is that it?
952,B,Yeah.
953,A,"Okay,"
954,A,"well, it was nice talking to you"
955,A,"and I, I guess I'll do this for, I was doing this for, actually, I was going to do it for my son so that he could, uh, he, he's in high school, so that he could make some money."
956,B,Right.
957,A,"Uh, but then it has my name on it,"
958,A,"so I'm like, okay,"
959,A,I'll sit down here and call it
960,B,"Well, we're doing it for a church choir"
961,B,"so,"
962,A,"Oh, are you?"
963,B,Yeah.
964,A,"Oh, that's interesting."
965,B,"So,"
966,A,That's nice.
967,A,"Well,"
968,B,"Well, thank you."
969,A,Thank you.
970,A,Bye.
971,B,Bye-bye.
972,A,So. Have you heard about Saturns?
973,B,seems to be out of I've heard some about Saturns.
974,B,I don't know a lot about them.
975,B,"I haven't been over, uh, to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight's paper that said that their, uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the, I guess, the Japanese cars."
976,A,"Ooh, that's great."
977,A,"Actually that's kind of the type of car that I, I'm thinking about we might get."
978,A,"Saturns, you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a, a Saturn dealer. This, this offshoot of G M"
979,B,Yeah.
980,A,"And, uh, supposedly, they've got great customer satisfaction from what things I've heard."
981,B,"Um. Yeah,"
982,B,I've heard a lot of people like them.
983,B,"Uh, yet I don't know whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point."
984,B,"I'm kind of,"
985,B,"my card and, uh, desires tend to be pretty picky"
986,B,"and so, uh."
987,A,"Well, like what?"
988,B,"Well, let's see."
989,B,"I I like cars that are designed with, with human beings in mind,"
990,B,and that's not just the driver and the passenger
991,B,"but that's the person who's working on it,"
992,B,"cause I do almost all my own maintenance and, uh  those types of things."
993,B,"And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in, uh, finding a car anymore that's, that's fairly easy for me to work on, it's just not very it's not very,"
994,B,almost unlikely at this point.
995,A,Yeah.
996,B,"And, uh,"
997,A,Yeah.
998,A,I've got a sixty-five Mustang
999,A,"and  I, and I do the work on, most of the work on that myself."
1000,B,Ooh.
1001,B,Uh-huh.
1002,A,"And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that, I just say I will never do that with the modern cars."
1003,A,It's not worth my time.
1004,A,You can't get in there.
1005,A,You can't do anything.
1006,B,Yeah.
1007,A,And it's so complicated too.
1008,A,I look at it
1009,A,"and I say, boy, you know,"
1010,A,"I, I'd have to almost go take a class or something like that."
1011,B,Well I've got an eighty-three Saab.
1012,A,Uh-huh.
1013,B,"And I find that for a normal, you know, everyday things. It's really very easy to work on"
1014,B,"and so, uh, you know, I'm kind of spoiled."
1015,B,I used to have a Chevy.
1016,A,Uh-huh.
1017,B,With a three fifty in it.
1018,A,Yeah.
1019,B,"And, uh, I really liked working on it. Uh, cause it was pretty easy too."
1020,B,It was about a nineteen seventy.
1021,B,"So I'm kind of, uh, biased in that"
1022,B,"and, you know, I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore."
1023,A,Yeah
1024,B,"And that's kind of, that's, that's probably one thing I'd look at."
1025,B,I think another thing I'd look at is safety.
1026,A,Yeah.
1027,A,That's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about.
1028,A,"Actually, the car, one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual  side air bags."
1029,B,Huh.
1030,B,"That's a real nice car, I think."
1031,A,Yeah
1032,B,"I've driven some, uh, Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips. Uh, as rental cars."
1033,A,Uh-huh
1034,B,And I've always been very impressed with the Taurus.
1035,B,It's a really nice car.
1036,B,I think it's very it's a stylish car both inside and out.
1037,B,It's comfortable to drive.
1038,B,"Uh, reasonable performance,"
1039,B,"and this is out in California where, where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore."
1040,A,Yeah.
1041,B,"Uh, I've been real impressed with that."
1042,B,"and I didn't realize that they were putting dual, uh, air bags in that car now."
1043,A,"Ninety,"
1044,A,yeah.
1045,A,"Or, excuse me, the ninety-twos."
1046,A,The  ninety-twos had dual air bags.
1047,B,Uh-huh.
1048,A,This newest model.
1049,A,You could  get them with duals
1050,B,I think  That's excellent.
1051,B,"That's excellent because,"
1052,A,Yeah.
1053,A,But the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars.
1054,A,"Actually, my, my wife and I are actually thinking, contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so."
1055,A,So we're actually  been looking around and thinking about things.
1056,B,Oh.
1057,A,We'd like to get like a
1058,A,"oh, I don't know."
1059,A,What do you call it?
1060,A,A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know.
1061,B,Uh-huh.
1062,A,Year old ninety-two or something like that.
1063,B,Uh-huh.
1064,B,Sure.
1065,B,Those are
1066,A,"See if we,"
1067,B,"yeah,"
1068,B,"that, that would be a good deal to go with."
1069,A,And the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns too.
1070,B,Okay.
1071,A,Because they looked really nice.
1072,B,Uh-huh.
1073,B,"What do you, what do you looking for in, in those?"
1074,B,"What, what attracts you to the Saturns?"
1075,B,"Or, or, of course, we've already talked, you know,"
1076,B,the Taurus is safe.
1077,B,But what kind of things are you looking for?
1078,A,"Well, the Saturns you can get air bags in them."
1079,A,I don't think you can get dual side air bags.
1080,B,Uh-huh.
1081,A,"But one of the, the two things that I'm really,"
1082,A,"the, the I'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart. That doesn't have problems."
1083,B,Uh-huh.
1084,A,You set down.
1085,A,You look at consumer reports.
1086,A,We've been pouring over consumer reports
1087,A,and you just get so depressed for the U S auto makers when you do that.
1088,B,Yeah.
1089,A,Because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have
1090,A,"and, and the two cars that apparently are close to that. That actually have high reliability, the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars."
1091,B,Uh-huh.
1092,A,"And the other one is, are the Saturns."
1093,B,Uh-huh.
1094,A,So those two things.
1095,A,"And then, you know, we kind of want a four door."
1096,B,Okay
1097,A,Okay.
1098,A,"What is your, uh, community, uh, currently doing with regard to recycling?"
1099,B,"Uh, basically, they're just, uh, having various recycling, uh, bins, uh, located for, uh, trash pickup."
1100,A,Uh-huh
1101,A,Well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts.
1102,A,"Some, some local communities are very active in that, uh, in that respect"
1103,A,and they do have bins set up.
1104,A,"But I live in a, a metropolitan area"
1105,A,"and, uh, they're not, uh, too inclined to do something as aggressive as that"
1106,B,"Well, here they and,"
1107,B,"uh, live in an apartment complex."
1108,A,Uh-huh.
1109,B,"And they only have one set of recycling bins, one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters."
1110,B,"So a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because, you know, it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins."
1111,A,"I, I know a lot, I think a lot of, uh, the, the issues with regard to recycling are that, uh, people have to be motivated to do, to do something like that because it does take extra effort."
1112,A,Whether
1113,A,"and, and I think that, and I know Massachusetts has,"
1114,A,a bottle bill was passed
1115,A,"and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now,"
1116,A,"and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably, believe it or not, is just to get the extra nickel at the, uh, the store and not, uh,"
1117,A,that's the majority of people that I know of anyways.
1118,A,"Where people aren't really, you know, eco conscious. It's just the fact that it's something they have to do."
1119,A,"And I'm not going to throw a bottle away,"
1120,A,it's like throwing a nickel away.
1121,A,That type of thing.
1122,B,Right.
1123,B,"They,  here they're trying to push through a bill"
1124,A,"But, uh, people need to be more conscious of it."
1125,B,and a lot of people are against it.
1126,B,"And it's going to create a lot more work for the, uh, the stores that sell, you know, sodas and stuff."
1127,B,Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything.
1128,A,Yeah
1129,A,"It didn't, it, it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans."
1130,A,"Uh, and, and matter of fact, I think it took like three tries for it to go through."
1131,A,"But, and it's been pretty successful"
1132,A,"and people notice it as far as, uh, highways being, uh, you know,"
1133,A,"people would have a drink of soda,"
1134,A,"instead of throwing out the window, they, they keep the bottle"
1135,A,"so it's, it's been a ecologically sound policy and, you know, as, as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth."
1136,A,"But more importantly, it's recycling reusable materials back into, uh, manufacturing."
1137,A,"And that's the big thing, I think, that they try to promote."
1138,B,Right.
1139,B,"I think here if they, uh, instead of just, you know, requiring that you put, put out the trash and stuff, if they could get some kind of rebate, those people who do put the stuff out, uh, you know, and separate it, have lower collection fee or something may  encourage people to separate."
1140,A,"Yeah,"
1141,A,that's a good idea.
1142,A,Yeah.
1143,A,there definitely has to be a motivation factor
1144,A,"and I know that, at where I work,"
1145,A,I work for a defense contractor.
1146,A,"And there's a big push on for recycling, uh, paper materials, you know, computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of, uh, Styrofoam usage because of the, uh, the process involved in Styrofoam and, and the whole eco issue and that."
1147,A,"And, and they're very proactive"
1148,A,"and, uh, matter of fact, they give you discounts if you use, uh, china wear rather than, uh, Styrofoam stuff,"
1149,A,"so. So, it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it."
1150,A,"I think that's, that's what they need to do. Be more like that."
1151,B,"Uh, I know, uh, I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books."
1152,B,"Uh, usually have them come from you know, projects to collect old ones."
1153,B,Usually just get dumped out with the trash.
1154,B,And phone books are a large volume of annual trash.
1155,A,Yeah.
1156,A,"They, they just,"
1157,A,"matter of fact, that, that reminded me of an article I saw in the"
1158,A,"the local schools, you could send your phone book to your, uh, to, with your kid to school"
1159,A,and what they'll do is they'll recycle it.
1160,A,"Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that, uh, trash, uh, the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time."
1161,A,"A guy went to a a landfill, dug down five feet and, and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty"
1162,A,"because they don't, they don't degrade over such a period of time."
1163,B,"Well, part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper."
1164,A,Yeah.
1165,B,They contain the glue and stuff
1166,B,"and they used to have to take out all the, uh, pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them."
1167,A,Yeah.
1168,B,"Now I think they've come up with some way of, uh, pulling the glue out."
1169,A,Yeah.
1170,A,Okay
1171,A,"Uh, let's see."
1172,A,"How about, uh, let's see, about ten years ago,"
1173,A,"uh, what do you think was different ten years ago from now?"
1174,B,"Well, I would say as, far as social changes go, uh, I think families were more together."
1175,B,"They, they did more things together."
1176,A,Uh-huh
1177,B,"Uh, they ate dinner at the table together."
1178,B,"Uh, the parents usually took out time, uh, you know, more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity."
1179,A,Uh-huh.
1180,B,"Uh, although I'm not a mother, I, I still think that, uh, a lot has changed since ten years ago."
1181,B,"Uh, what do you  think about that?"
1182,A,"We,"
1183,A,"Well, uh, actually ten years from today seems rather short."
1184,B,Yeah.
1185,A,"Uh, but I do agree that, uh, generally it's, society has sort of, uh, let's see, rushed everything ahead."
1186,B,Uh-huh.
1187,A,"And, uh, I don't know,"
1188,A,"it leaves, leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that."
1189,A,"In other words, they just prioritize their lives differently."
1190,A,But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation.
1191,B,Yes.
1192,B,"What about like as far as, uh, social changes in the individual?"
1193,B,"Do  you think that the individual has as much time as they did, let's say, ten, twenty years ago?"
1194,A,"Uh,"
1195,A,Um. It depends.
1196,A,"Uh, it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too."
1197,B,Uh-huh.
1198,A,"Uh, I just"
1199,B,"Well, how, how old are you?"
1200,A,I'm twenty-eight.
1201,B,Twenty-eight.
1202,B,"Okay,"
1203,B,I'm twenty-three.
1204,A,Yeah.
1205,B,So there's maybe a five year gap between us.
1206,A,Yeah.
1207,B,"So, uh."
1208,A,"I just, I think that things were a bit, were, have been busy all along."
1209,A,"It's just  a matter where priorities are, at placed. And that, uh, usually as far as families are concerned, there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home."
1210,B,Huh
1211,B,Yes.
1212,B,Uh-huh.
1213,A,"And now, uh, it's pretty much an economic necessity of, for most, in most places for both parents to work."
1214,B,Do you think it's an economic necessity
1215,B,"or do you think that we're, we're, uh, all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living?"
1216,A,I think that's part of it too.
1217,A,"But I do think,"
1218,B,"I mean do you think, people really need two cars and  a house in the suburbs or,"
1219,A,"No,"
1220,A,no.
1221,A,I don't.
1222,A,"No,"
1223,A,I don't think that.
1224,A,"But then there are a lot of people that, that don't have that. But, that really do need to work."
1225,B,Uh-huh.
1226,B,Uh-huh.
1227,A,"I think maybe those people that really do need to work, both parents, just to survive."
1228,A,"And  then there, is, is that other group that is  working to maintain a standard of living that, uh, they think is, is surviving which is really more luxuries."
1229,B,Yeah.
1230,B,Uh-huh.
1231,B,Okay.
1232,B,Uh-huh.
1233,A,"Uh, but I I tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive."
1234,B,"so you think it's,"
1235,B,which group are you saying is the one trying?
1236,A,"I'm saying that the, uh, the group that is just trying to survive from day to day, where both parents are working is more of the majority than the, than the people that have the higher standard of living."
1237,B,Uh-huh.
1238,A,"Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing, uh, middle class in this country I think that that's, in my opinion, the case."
1239,B,Uh-huh.
1240,B,Okay.
1241,A,So.
1242,A,"I mean I have met people that, uh, both that, that just want to maintain a, the standard of living and those that, that really need the job."
1243,B,Okay.
1244,B,"And then, sometimes I, I often, uh, find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. a microwave, a V C R, a answering machine a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of those items, um, for the, for the, uh,"
1245,A,Uh-huh.
1246,B,well I guess we're sticking more to social changes
1247,B,"but, uh people want all of that"
1248,A,Uh-huh.
1249,B,and not all of those are necessities.
1250,A,Right
1251,B,"So they're trying to,"
1252,B,it has become a necessity
1253,A,Okay.
1254,B,"I say they, uh,"
1255,B,"probably the best things to do is, is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water"
1256,B,they  they're innocent right.
1257,A,I see.
1258,A,"A  a good, a good southern solution."
1259,B,Yeah.
1260,B,"Uh, so, uh, how do you, how do you feel?"
1261,B,"that's, of course, being facetious"
1262,B,but
1263,A,Uh-huh.
1264,A,You'd have to say that.
1265,A,"Uh, I don't know."
1266,A,"The, the things they asked to talk about were whether the, uh, whether the judge should be the one that does the, uh, sentencing."
1267,B,Uh-huh.
1268,A,"And seems to me that that's, I think that's the way it's done now."
1269,A,"Uh, at least, my understanding of the law which isn't very good."
1270,B,Uh-huh.
1271,A,"Uh, it seems to me that the judge does it"
1272,A,"and I, I think that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the, the norm is for a particular thing."
1273,B,Uh-huh.
1274,B,"And, I guess, also what the system will absorb"
1275,A,Right.
1276,B,Probably more tuned in to that.
1277,B,"Possibly though on, uh, capital cases like maybe the death penalty"
1278,A,Uh-huh.
1279,B,"uh, I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole,"
1280,B,I mean he could have like a personal prejudice.
1281,B,"You know, judges are people like everybody else  even though they're, they're supposed to be impartial"
1282,A,That's right.
1283,B,"but maybe, uh,"
1284,A,"And I think that may, I, that may be an exception as well."
1285,A,"Because I think that,"
1286,A,"doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than, than the judge?"
1287,B,"I, I think that's, I think that's the way it is."
1288,A,Yeah.
1289,B,"Uh, whether they, they decide whether or not they, uh, the accused or whatever would get the, uh, get the death penalty."
1290,B,Do they have a death penalty in California?
1291,A,Yes.
1292,A,"In  fact, they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month."
1293,B,Yeah.
1294,B,Uh-huh.
1295,A,"And, uh, there's a big uproar going on right now. Uh"
1296,B,Yeah.
1297,A,"the, uh, Governor, you know, has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not."
1298,B,Uh-huh.
1299,A,"You know, it's someone who had, uh, killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact."
1300,B,Yeah.
1301,B,"I,"
1302,B,"something like that, I've got no problem with it. Uh"
1303,A,Yeah.
1304,B,"I guess the way I think about it is not, it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge."
1305,B,It's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people
1306,A,Uh-huh.
1307,B,"put it to sleep, you know."
1308,B,"Just get it out, you know,"
1309,B,"it's not able to fit in, you know"
1310,A,Something inexpensive.
1311,B,Yeah.
1312,B,"Yeah,"
1313,B,exactly
1314,B,"Uh, I guess, kind of the way I think about it also, is they just,"
1315,B,"if somebody gets the death penalty, they're, they're judged guilty,"
1316,B,"they got the death penalty,"
1317,B,they should have one year and one appeal. Cover all their bases with one appeal
1318,B,"and if not, you know, don't, don't let them sit up there on death row for, you know, fifteen years."
1319,A,Yeah.
1320,A,I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years.
1321,B,Uh-huh.
1322,B,"Yeah,"
1323,B,"that,"
1324,A,But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake
1325,A,and  you'd hate to be one of those.
1326,B,Yeah.
1327,B,"Oh, I'm sure"
1328,B,Yeah.
1329,A,"The other thing they asked about was whether uh, uh, the verdict should be required to be unanimous. Which, again, I think is the way it is now. That all the, all verdicts,"
1330,B,Uh-huh.
1331,A,well maybe not.
1332,A,I don't know.
1333,A,At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be  unanimous.
1334,B,I believe it is  in capital.
1335,B,"I think in like, uh, lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six, whatever How ever many is on, sitting on a jury."
1336,A,Uh-huh.
1337,B,I I believe that's the way it is.
1338,B,But I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases. Uh
1339,A,Yeah.
1340,A,"The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial. And that there's one juror that is, is, uh, different than the other eleven."
1341,B,Uh-huh.
1342,B,Yeah.
1343,A,"And, uh, they've only deliberated four hours or, something"
1344,A,and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked.
1345,B,"Oh, no"
1346,A,the judge told them  they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet
1347,B,"I'm telling you, go one way or the other."
1348,B,"That, that's probably an expensive trial."
1349,A,Yeah.
1350,A,Six months so far they said.
1351,B,Yeah.
1352,B,Probably.
1353,A,So.
1354,B,Yeah.
1355,B,Probably.
1356,B,"You know, I'm not sure there's a number."
1357,B,"It's probably like thirty, forty thousand dollars a day you know, worth of all the free for all."
1358,A,"Maybe they could go with a, with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their, uh, vote."
1359,B,Yeah
1360,B,"Yeah,"
1361,B,"that's, that's been so long I've practically forgot who Noriega was, you know."
1362,A,Right.
1363,B,That has been going on
1364,B,"My, uh, cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami."
1365,A,Oh really?
1366,B,Yeah.
1367,B,So she follows that stuff pretty closely.
1368,B,"But, uh,"
1369,A,That's interesting.
1370,B,"Yeah,"
1371,B,"she's not involved in that, that case."
1372,B,"But she does,"
1373,A,Well have you ever served on a jury?
1374,B,No
1375,B,I haven't.
1376,B,I never have.
1377,B,My wife has
1378,B,"but I, I haven't."
1379,A,Uh-huh.
1380,A,I got called
1381,A,"but I, uh, never, uh, got selected for a jury"
1382,B,Uh-huh.
1383,A,"I sat for ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process,"
1384,B,Uh-huh.
1385,A,"and they had some guy that was, uh, defending himself."
1386,B,Uh-huh.
1387,B,Bye to someone speaking to
1388,B,"So we're, uh, our discussion's about, uh, the care of the elderly?"
1389,A,"That's right,"
1390,A,that's right.
1391,A,"You know, what, what, uh, what do you think is important?"
1392,A,"If you were,"
1393,A,"uh, I don't know how, how old you are,"
1394,A,"but if you had, if you had, uh, parents say or, or, or grandparents, whatever it is, uh, who were ready, who, who you thought might benefit from a nursing home, what do you think you would look for?"
1395,B,"Uh, well I, actually my dad's, my dad's almost ninety"
1396,B,and  he lives by himself
1397,A,Huh.
1398,B,and he's in good shape.
1399,A,Yeah.
1400,B,"Uh, but, uh, some friends of mine have, uh, gone through this."
1401,B,"I think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and, uh, where they did some things to try to keep them, um, mentally alive. And where there was, uh, caring and compassionate, where there were caring and compassionate people, uh, operating it."
1402,A,Yeah.
1403,B,Do  you have any experience with this yourself?
1404,A,Huh.
1405,A,"Well my, uh, uh, my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in, uh, Minnesota"
1406,B,Uh-huh.
1407,A,"and we go there, uh, once a year."
1408,A,"We see, we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston"
1409,A,so we're pretty far away.
1410,A,When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her.
1411,B,Uh-huh.
1412,A,"And it seems, uh,"
1413,A,"I mean the, the environment there, I don't know too much about it"
1414,A,"but it, it seems nice enough."
1415,A,"Uh, it, it's hard,"
1416,A,"at least half of the residents I would say are not, not mentally sound."
1417,A,"So it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to to retain, uh, clarity, say, uh, know"
1418,B,"From the lack of stimulation, you mean."
1419,A,Yeah.
1420,A,"Well I, I I don't know."
1421,A,"We, we also, my wife and I, uh, uh, volunteer to go to a, uh, nursing home that's just a mile from our house."
1422,A,"We, uh, she goes more often than I."
1423,A,"We used to go once a month, once every two months to visit some of the patients there."
1424,A,"And we'd take, we have a two year old son"
1425,A,"and so we, sometimes we'd take him with us."
1426,A,"And, uh, there I would say it's the same thing."
1427,A,"It's, it's a nice, uh, relatively nice environment"
1428,A,"but again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who are, who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but, but, certainly, uh, certainly have are, have retained all of their, uh, mental skills and so on."
1429,A,"It's, must be depressing to, to walk, walk the halls and see, and see all these other people who really don't know where they are."
1430,B,"Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with, that the people who operate it seem to have, what you'd perceive of as genuine concern?"
1431,A,"I think, yeah,"
1432,A,"I think they're relatively respectful. Yeah and, and concerned that, in as much as they can be."
1433,A,"I, I think sometimes, you know, I've noticed, uh, people asking for, uh, some of the patients asking for things, uh, just repetitively and, but things that are not reasonable,"
1434,B,Uh-huh.
1435,A,"and so  at some level the, the, the, uh,"
1436,B,Yeah.
1437,A,"I'm sure that the, that the, uh, the staff learn what's normal for this person"
1438,A,"and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just, you know, is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need, you know."
1439,B,Yeah.
1440,B,"It, it's possible,"
1441,B,"I was thinking also that there'd be, there could be a fair burn out factor um, in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes, depending on the person, not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need."
1442,A,"Oh, yeah."
1443,A,Yeah.
1444,A,"I'll tell you one thing though that'll, that, that I, I saw that was really nice."
1445,A,"We saw a husband and wife,"
1446,A,"we used to see a husband and wife in there, uh, together"
1447,A,and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were
1448,A,but these two were.
1449,B,Uh-huh.
1450,A,"And when you walked into their room, they had brought all their furniture from their house"
1451,B,Uh-huh.
1452,B,So it  gives them a sense of identity.
1453,A,"And so,"
1454,A,"Yeah,"
1455,A,you walked in there
1456,A,"and it didn't look like, uh, you know, how, you, you walk into some rooms"
1457,A,"and there's, it's completely generic."
1458,A,"There's nothing, maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person"
1459,A,and that's it.
1460,A,"But this room, on the other hand, you know, they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that"
1461,A,and they had all their stuff from their house
1462,A,"and it looked like, uh, it must have been,"
1463,A,it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them
1464,A,"and it must also give them a sense of, uh, uh, security and, and, uh, and, and, you know, uh,"
1465,B,"Yeah,"
1466,B,"I, I think part of what you're saying matches what I have read."
1467,B,"I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who, uh, were adequately deficient in their abilities, uh  physical or mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves."
1468,A,Yeah.
1469,B,"But I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide, um, a lot of social activities."
1470,A,Huh.
1471,A,Yeah.
1472,B,"Uh, the, one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities"
1473,B,and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation.
1474,B,"Uh, and,"
1475,A,Huh.
1476,A,temporary.
1477,A,"I,"
1478,A,"that, that's, that's new to me."
1479,A,"I,"
1480,B,"Well I think it, I think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there"
1481,B,"and I feel like, the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like, like put her in there."
1482,A,"Right,"
1483,A,right.
1484,B,"And there, there's so much,"
1485,A,Okay.
1486,A,"Uh, so your, you, I guess you're probably in the same, uh, same situation uh, we're in."
1487,A,We're kind of past having to provide child care.
1488,A,"Our, our kids are grown up."
1489,A,We don't have any grandchildren yet.
1490,A,"But, uh, uh, they're,"
1491,B,Uh-huh.
1492,B,How old are your children?
1493,A,"Uh, one's twenty-six"
1494,A,"and the other is, uh, twenty, twenty-one."
1495,B,Uh-huh
1496,A,"So they're, uh, uh, They're, they're getting there."
1497,B,"Well, they're going to be getting there."
1498,A,"You know, there's no  no, no prospects right away for anything to happen."
1499,B,Yeah.
1500,B,uh-huh.
1501,B,"Oh, I see."
1502,A,"But, uh,"
1503,B,"I have, uh, five children."
1504,B,I have a eighteen year old son.
1505,B,"The of my girls are like twenty-three, twenty-six, twenty-eight, and twenty-nine."
1506,A,Uh-huh.
1507,B,And I have three granddaughters right now.
1508,A,Oh.
1509,B,"And, uh, I, uh,"
1510,B,one's in Iowa.
1511,A,Uh-huh.
1512,B,"And, uh, she's, she's a teacher"
1513,B,"and what she does is she, teaches at a preschool."
1514,A,"Oh, okay."
1515,B,"And, and so she kind of,"
1516,B,"and they let her bring her, her little daughter in for free."
1517,A,Uh-huh.
1518,B,"And then, so"
1519,B,but she just works part-time.
1520,A,Uh-huh.
1521,B,"Then I have another daughter in, uh, Bountiful, Utah"
1522,B,and she has to work full-time
1523,B,and it's just tearing her apart.
1524,B,She has a private baby-sitter.
1525,A,Yeah.
1526,B,"And, uh, the baby just screams."
1527,B,"I mean, the baby is like seventeen months"
1528,B,and she just screams.
1529,A,Uh-huh.
1530,B,Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there.
1531,B,They're not even there yet you know.
1532,A,Uh-huh.
1533,A,Yeah.
1534,A,It's hard.
1535,A,"We,"
1536,B,"And, and then I have my, uh, uh, I have a seven month old granddaughter"
1537,B,"and, uh, her mother stays home"
1538,B,"and she, they live, they live with us. You know, in, as Orange County is really expensive."
1539,A,Uh-huh.
1540,A,Uh-huh.
1541,B,They live with us
1542,B,"and so, of course, we love it. Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time."
1543,B,"But, uh, uh, she just,"
1544,B,"uh, she used to work in pre, in the preschool and, and, and child care"
1545,B,and she says after working in there
1546,B,"and, and, you know, here she was a provider"
1547,B,"but, you know, there's only so much one person can do."
1548,A,Yeah.
1549,B,She said it's so awful.
1550,B,"She said she'll never put her child in a, in a, in a in a in a preschool."
1551,A,Uh-huh.
1552,B,I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere.
1553,A,Huh.
1554,B,"But it's really, it's really, really very difficult"
1555,B,"and,"
1556,A,Yeah.
1557,A,What did you do when your kids were growing up?
1558,A,"Were you,"
1559,B,"Well, when, when"
1560,B,"the, uh, the first, uh, ten years, see first ten or twelve years, I stayed home."
1561,A,Uh-huh.
1562,B,"And, uh, then after that I, I went to work."
1563,A,Uh-huh.
1564,B,"And, uh, uh, uh, a couple of times I just, uh, uh, you know,"
1565,B,then I had one job
1566,B,and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job.
1567,B,"And then, and then like about, later I, I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter."
1568,B,"Supposed to be good, uh, recommended person from the church"
1569,B,and I knew her personally.
1570,B,She had two kids of her own and everything.
1571,B,But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child.
1572,A,Uh-huh.
1573,B,"I mean, first of all, uh, her children were sick all the time."
1574,B,"So when my son stayed over there, he got sick."
1575,A,"He got sick,"
1576,A,yeah.
1577,B,"Same thing, same thing that the, her kids had,"
1578,B,right?
1579,A,Right.
1580,A,"Well,"
1581,B,"And so, uh, we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock."
1582,B,"Then he, she'd take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten."
1583,B,But
1584,B,"that day, uh, I was saying now he, he's sick."
1585,B,"And she goes well, she goes, he has the same thing that all my kids have."
1586,B,"That's what he got, you know."
1587,B,"Goes, well, okay,"
1588,B,so it's not like he's going to infect her kids.
1589,B,"But then what happened was, is, I said, uh, he just threw up"
1590,B,and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty
1591,B,so she said well she'll keep him home
1592,B,and he'll probably just sleep anyway.
1593,B,"Well, you know, what"
1594,B,"that woman sent her, sent him to kindergarten."
1595,B,She sent him to kindergarten.
1596,B,"As soon as he went there, the teacher took one look at him"
1597,B,and he threw up again
1598,B,"and they put him in the nursery, uh, they put him in the nurse's office."
1599,A,yeah.
1600,B,"And then what happened was, is, you know, they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter."
1601,B,Called her
1602,B,"and they said, uh, that he's sick."
1603,B,Well she wasn't home.
1604,A,Huh.
1605,B,"I mean her, all her kids were sick"
1606,B,"but she wasn't home, right."
1607,B,"And her, and her, her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick."
1608,B,"Now why didn't he, why didn't she keep him home with her?"
1609,B,"No,"
1610,B,she didn't do that.
1611,B,"So, it got to the point where he's, he's supposed to get out of, uh, kindergarten like about two thirty."
1612,B,And I had to leave work.
1613,B,"It was, it was five o'clock in the evening"
1614,B,and I found out he was still there at school.
1615,B,And they were calling me
1616,B,and they said somebody's got to pick him up.
1617,B,"And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up, she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school."
1618,B,I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff.
1619,B,And he had a hundred and four fever.
1620,B,"They couldn't, uh, give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything."
1621,A,Right.
1622,B,I was so furious.
1623,B,"I, I quit that job"
1624,B,and I stayed home for awhile longer.
1625,B,"Then I went and got a, uh, a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better."
1626,A,"Yeah,"
1627,A,a little more flexibility.
1628,A,You can come and go.
1629,B,"Yeah,"
1630,B,"but, uh, I haven't had any good, really very good experience with child care"
1631,A,Yeah.
1632,A,"When, when our kids were small we had a couple of, uh, good, good women who, uh, would often uh, get them to come to the house."
1633,A,"So, who's your favorite team?"
1634,B,My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers.
1635,A,Pittsburgh?
1636,B,You bet.
1637,A,I used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little.
1638,B,"Well, I, uh,"
1639,B,"when played he was from my hometown in Alabama,"
1640,A,"Oh, really?"
1641,B,"so I kind of grabbed on to that team,  way back when."
1642,A,Huh.
1643,A,pretty
1644,A,that's good.
1645,A,"I, I used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain,  or steel curtain."
1646,B,That's right.
1647,B,How about your favorite team?
1648,A,Huh.
1649,A,"Well, last year it was Buffalo"
1650,A,"and I, I still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just, they just impressed me as being so efficient"
1651,A,and they never score.
1652,A,They never blow out their opponents.
1653,A,"They just score just enough points,"
1654,B,Uh-huh.
1655,A,and that really impressed me.
1656,A,But then down here I
1657,A,is pretty close to New Orleans
1658,A,and I've been keeping up with the Saints a lot.
1659,B,"Well, they are exciting, aren't they?"
1660,A,"Yeah,"
1661,A,"the Saints are starting to impress me this year, you know, a lot."
1662,B,"Boy,"
1663,B,"they are, they are just a fun team to watch."
1664,A,"This, it, they are really."
1665,A,"Did you see the game Sunday night or,  Sunday afternoon?"
1666,B,"Uh,  no,"
1667,B,I didn't.
1668,A,It was funny.
1669,A,"There were, they uh, a fireworks display at halftime."
1670,B,"Oh, yeah?"
1671,A,"Yeah,"
1672,A,and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire.
1673,B,"Oh, you're kidding"
1674,A,"So, they had to stop the game lieu the third quarter and put out this fire."
1675,B,"Oh, my"
1676,A,"Those big piece of something came flaming, falling out of the roof and landed on the field"
1677,A,so there's this big fire on the field
1678,A,and they were dumping the bucket and everything.
1679,B,"Oh, I can't believe that."
1680,A,It was
1681,A,"I mean, you just really can't tell what's going to happen."
1682,B,That's hilarious.
1683,A,I know.
1684,A,It's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints.
1685,B,Uh-huh.
1686,A,And Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal.
1687,B,Oh.
1688,A,"And it, it was beautiful, right down the middle."
1689,B,"Oh, boy."
1690,B,"He is tough,"
1691,B,he has an incredible leg.
1692,A,He is.
1693,A,Yes.
1694,B,"Well, do you think they're, they're going to be able to make it this year,  past the first playoff game?"
1695,A,Uh I  I sure hope so.
1696,A,"I'm not sure, I'm not sure who they play."
1697,A,Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams.
1698,B,Who's that?
1699,A,"It's pretty much going between Washington. They are undefeated. And, uh, Buffalo, New Orleans, and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice"
1700,B,Right.
1701,A,and one of those was to Buffalo.
1702,A,And they beat the Saints.
1703,A,Their only time they lost.
1704,B,"What do you think about, uh, Houston?"
1705,A,Houston.
1706,A,I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis.
1707,B,"Oh, yeah?"
1708,A,Yeah.
1709,A,"Uh, from what I saw they were playing,"
1710,A,"when I was at the game we sat right on the front row,  right behind the Houston Oilers,"
1711,B,Huh.
1712,A,"and from what I saw the game Houston, Houston impressed me a lot."
1713,B,Huh.
1714,A,"But my brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night,"
1715,A,and if that was an off night I'd hate to see when he's on a good night.
1716,B,"Oh, yeah,"
1717,B,"he's he definitely, uh, is one of the best I think."
1718,A,"He's,"
1719,A,"Yeah,"
1720,A,"the, their, their backfield is really impressive."
1721,A,Haywood and Drew Hill and
1722,B,Right.
1723,A,they really impress me.
1724,B,"Well, they squeaked out a game on Sunday."
1725,A,That's right.
1726,A,"Who, who did they play?"
1727,B,They played Dallas.
1728,A,"Dallas,"
1729,A,"that's right,"
1730,B,"They won,  in overtime."
1731,A,"all because,"
1732,A,That's right.
1733,A,I remember that now.
1734,B,"So that was,"
1735,B,"I, I watched that game"
1736,B,"and, uh, that was, uh,"
1737,A,Do you have a favorite between those two?
1738,B,"Well, because I'm right here in Dallas I, I kind of pull for Dallas."
1739,A,Really?
1740,B,Yeah.
1741,B,"Well, also Houston is, uh, in Pittsburgh's division"
1742,B,"so,  I'll almost always root against them."
1743,A,"Well, that's true."
1744,A,I hate to say it
1745,A,but I hate Dallas
1746,B,That's okay
1747,B,"Well I, you know, I, I was never really a big Dallas fan until we moved here"
1748,A,Yeah.
1749,B,and they just kind of grew on me.
1750,A,"Yeah,"
1751,A,I imagine.
1752,A,"That's the way,"
1753,A,I've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two
1754,A,"and they, they've actually started doing something."
1755,B,Yeah.
1756,B,Yeah.
1757,A,"So, I've actually paid attention to them."
1758,B,Well
1759,A,"Well, do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in?"
1760,B,To tell you the truth I haven't paid too much attention to that.
1761,A,Really?
1762,B,"Um, what cities are they looking at?"
1763,A,"Uh, right now I think this Memphis, they're, they're trying to get the teams."
1764,B,Uh-huh.
1765,A,"And that's, that's where I was when I saw, uh,  Houston play."
1766,B,Uh-huh.
1767,A,Saint Louis is trying to get a team.
1768,A,"Uh, Baltimore is trying to get a team,"
1769,A,and there's some other city.
1770,A,I'm wanting to say Raleigh
1771,A,but I'm not sure.
1772,B,"You know, I think you are right."
1773,B,I think it is Raleigh.
1774,A,Think so?
1775,B,I think I remember hearing that.
1776,A,Uh-huh.
1777,A,Because I know they've got a football team
1778,A,but I think it might be them.
1779,B,That would be fun.
1780,B,I'd like to see some more teams get in.
1781,A,"I would, definitely."
1782,A,I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after.
1783,A,"And right now I think Memphis and, it's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it."
1784,B,Uh-huh.
1785,A,Because I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis
1786,A,and when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did.
1787,B,"Oh, really?"
1788,A,Yeah.
1789,A,"It's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two,"
1790,A,"I think that, uh, one, uh, advantage of having, uh, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't, uh, convict someone who, uh, really shouldn't be convicted."
1791,B,Definitely.
1792,A,"Um, and I think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, uh, helps to ensure that."
1793,A,"I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted."
1794,B,Uh-huh.
1795,A,Have you ever served on a jury before?
1796,B,"Uh, I have twice."
1797,A,"Oh, okay."
1798,B,It was a pretty wild experience.
1799,A,"Uh, what sorts of cases were they?"
1800,B,"They were just, you know, small time cases where, uh, trailers and banks were involved, you know."
1801,A,So were they criminal or civil?
1802,B,They were civil.
1803,B,They weren't  they weren't any criminal.
1804,A,"Oh, okay."
1805,A,"What, uh, what was the verdict?"
1806,A,"Did the, did the jury have trouble reaching a decision?"
1807,B,"Uh, the jury, it was, uh, let me see, I think it was ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people"
1808,A,Yeah.
1809,B,"so it was,"
1810,B,"they,"
1811,B,"and, uh, the one changed his vote at the end."
1812,A,So did it become?
1813,B,"So it became unanimous, you know, after they turned it in"
1814,A,Yeah.
1815,B,and then he changed his mind after they turned it in
1816,A,Uh.
1817,B,but it then became unanimous.
1818,A,"Uh. But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, right?"
1819,A,You just needed a majority?
1820,B,Right.
1821,A,"What was, what was the other case?"
1822,A,That was also civil?
1823,B,"The, the other case was just traffic,"
1824,B,"the,"
1825,B,"and, you know, it was seat belt law"
1826,A,Yeah.
1827,B,"and it, it didn't even hardly go through,"
1828,A,"Oh, didn't really even count."
1829,B,so.
1830,A,Yeah.
1831,A,"I'm, I'm a college student"
1832,A,"so I haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long"
1833,B,Yeah.
1834,A,"um, and, uh, I did get one summons actually at one point,"
1835,A,"but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad time."
1836,B,Yeah.
1837,B,"Well, you learn a lot going to the juries like that though."
1838,A,"Yeah, I mean, I, I really, I would like to, uh, to do at some point, um,"
1839,A,"but, I, I haven't."
1840,A,"Uh, one, one thing that I, I think is, um, you know, maybe is a problem is, uh, I, I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now,"
1841,A,but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.
1842,A,Especially sort of.
1843,B,"I wouldn't think that it does I mean, from, from my, from what I experienced in them,"
1844,A,"How,"
1845,B,"it didn't, you know, it didn't turn out the way I planned it, I mean, the way that I would think that it would go."
1846,A,"Uh, you thought it turned out pretty well?"
1847,B,"Yeah,"
1848,B,"but it was, you know, it was,"
1849,B,jury was unorganized
1850,B,"and it was, it was just wasn't organized enough for me."
1851,A,Yeah.
1852,B,"I'm not used to it not being organized,"
1853,B,and I just assumed that it would have been.
1854,A,"Oh, so it was just kind of a zoo"
1855,A,"and the jurors just sort of,"
1856,A,someone had to figure out what was going on?
1857,B,That's about what it was.
1858,A,Um. That's interesting.
1859,A,"Did it, did it work out pretty well in the end?"
1860,A,"I mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, uh, sort of a moderator role in the trial"
1861,A,"or,"
1862,B,"Yeah,"
1863,B,"they, well they picked one person,"
1864,B,"and then he finally, you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have."
1865,A,So it it did end up working out pretty well?
1866,B,"Yeah,"
1867,B,it ended up working all right.
1868,A,"The one thing I sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes"
1869,B,Yes.
1870,A,"you know, it's not just a matter of, um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy,"
1871,A,"and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract,"
1872,A,"it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues,"
1873,A,"and I wonder if, uh, if there's really, um, if the system works adequately in, in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion."
1874,B,"I, I don't think that they, they, they educate them enough to, to really know what's going on."
1875,A,"In, in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind."
1876,A,So.
1877,B,"Yeah,"
1878,B,"the, the bank was suing them for, uh, because they went to get the, the trailer that, which was, uh, seemingly their property."
1879,A,Yeah.
1880,A,Uh.
1881,B,It was on his property.
1882,A,"Oh, so the deal was that he had, uh, borrowed money from the bank to buy it,"
1883,A,and he hadn't made the payments.
1884,B,Right.
1885,B,So they came to get it.
1886,A,Yeah.
1887,B,"And then when they came to get it, well, it was on the landlord's property"
1888,B,and he wouldn't let them take it off.
1889,A,"Uh, so they were suing to get it back."
1890,B,"So, and they are, it was a double wide,"
1891,B,so they'd already taken it apart.
1892,A,Uh.
1893,B,So they left it there
1894,A,Yeah.
1895,B,and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it.
1896,A,Uh.
1897,B,"So they were suing him for the money,"
1898,B,"and, you know, there's no way they could because it, it was the moving company,"
1899,A,"Uh, I get most of my news uh, from newspapers really."
1900,A,"I read the daily newspaper, uh, the HOUSTON CHRONICLE"
1901,A,"and sometimes I'll read like the, uh, WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES."
1902,A,"I don't subscribe to either,"
1903,A,but sometimes I get a hold of copies of it.
1904,A,"Uh, how about you?"
1905,A,"Do you, uh, mostly get things from T V or"
1906,B,Yes.
1907,B,"I actually get most of my news coverage off uh, computer networks."
1908,B,"However, I do also watch television news, uh, usually in the morning once a day"
1909,B,and I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL most every day.
1910,A,Oh.
1911,A,Oh that's interesting.
1912,A,You said computer networks.
1913,A,"Uh, what, uh, what sort."
1914,A,I am fairly knowledgeable of
1915,B,"Uh well, well DOW JONES for example have the, cause the  uh, news wire"
1916,A,"Uh, okay."
1917,A,That's interesting.
1918,B,"and it's picked up and actually available, uh, at my office,"
1919,B,"so, it's, no fee, or subscription either to read at my leisure"
1920,B,and it's sort of by category.
1921,B,For example so I can read a certain business or topics.
1922,A,Oh.
1923,A,"is it, is it the A P news wire"
1924,A,"or is it something that is, uh, a little bit different from that?"
1925,B,"Well, uh, it's similar to that,"
1926,B,"but it's DOW JONES, which is, uh, the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire."
1927,A,"Uh, okay."
1928,A,"So, that's that's interesting."
1929,A,Okay.
1930,A,"Yeah,"
1931,A,"I've had, I had access in the past to, uh, uh, the A P news wire"
1932,A,and I thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news.
1933,A,"Uh, I've never used the DOW JONES news wire"
1934,A,"but, uh,"
1935,A,yeah
1936,A,"it, uh,"
1937,A,"do you get any, uh, do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader, like more long term analytical sort of approach?"
1938,B,"Uh, well actually not."
1939,B,"Uh, I do, uh, follow, uh, uh, uh,"
1940,B,I don't know how to how to describe it
1941,B,"so I'll say a religious newspaper which, which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense."
1942,B,"It's a weekly but, uh, but not, uh, not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things."
1943,A,Yeah
1944,B,"I'd like to say that however, uh, that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires"
1945,A,In what way?
1946,A,"In like, in sort of like, uh, uh, quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like, view point or the way the news is presented or whatever?"
1947,B,"Uh, I think that it, I think that it has to do with, uh,"
1948,B,"I personally think, uh,"
1949,B,"I, I have a problem with their viewpoint"
1950,B,"and I personally think that, uh,  that there's a strong there's a strong bias in the media."
1951,A,Yeah.
1952,A,Well you won't offend me.
1953,A,So go ahead and say
1954,A,Yeah.
1955,A,Like a liberal type of bias.
1956,B,Yeah.
1957,B,Absolutely.
1958,B,"Uh, after all, who, who writes."
1959,B,People who are journalist who are trained to write
1960,B,"and they're, that's a liberal, uh, a liberal field at least from academia"
1961,A,Yeah.
1962,B,"and, uh, the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in, I find their descriptions to be wrong"
1963,A,Yeah.
1964,A,Yeah.
1965,B,"and it,"
1966,A,"They, they generally make mistake on anything technical at least"
1967,B,That's right.
1968,B,"Well, even if it's not technical. If it's, uh, some social thing or whatever. It doesn't matter."
1969,B,"If I am an expert in it, they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think I'm not expert in it."
1970,B,They're telling me lies.
1971,A,Yeah.
1972,A,Yeah.
1973,A,"Do you, by mistakes, do you mean just like honest mistakes"
1974,A,or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things?
1975,B,"Uh, I think both."
1976,B,"Uh, by deliberate I, uh, I mean mistake, mistakes of omission or, uh, or, uh, biased toward a particular view point a particular liberal view point that they have."
1977,A,Yeah.
1978,A,Yeah.
1979,A,Yeah.
1980,A,Yeah.
1981,B,"So, uh, uh, to give you an example, uh, we will go out of the printing media."
1982,B,"I know of cases where, uh, we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but, with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you. Which is sort of like a deliberate bias. Which is which is rather disturbing."
1983,A,Huh.
1984,A,Huh. That's disturbing.
1985,B,I mean he does that.
1986,A,"I haven't really noticed them doing that,"
1987,A,"but whatever,"
1988,A,again I don't watch T V news that much now.
1989,A,"If I had access to C N N, I would watch T V news more."
1990,A,"Uh, I don't you know, but I don't usually."
1991,B,"Yeah,"
1992,B,"I don't have access either. Although, I did at one time"
1993,B,"and it was,"
1994,B,I did during the Gulf War
1995,B,and it was addictive.
1996,A,Yeah.
1997,A,"Did you, did you think that C N N, well, the Gulf War coverage would be kind of, uh, an abnormality?"
1998,A,I just I guess.
1999,A,I would be curious to know what you thought as to how like say C N N T V news compared to the three networks.
2000,A,"Uh, you know whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever"
2001,A,"but I, I guess you wouldn't."
2002,A,"You probably,"
2003,A,"if you just watched it during the Gulf War, that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much."
2004,B,"Yeah,"
2005,B,"well during that small sample, I would think that everyone was just about, just about the same, except the three networks, radio television programming."
2006,A,Yeah.
2007,B,"So, if at a particular time, you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by, uh, turning on C N N"
2008,A,Yeah.
2009,B,"and you,"
2010,A,"Anyway, uh"
2011,B,How about you.
2012,B,What do you do with your budget?
2013,A,"What do I do,"
2014,A,"uh, at the moment it's under chaos."
2015,A,"Uh, right now I'm just, uh,"
2016,A,"I, I don't really have a budget per se."
2017,A,"I'm, I, uh, it's called living within your means You know, which means at the moment, paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse"
2018,B,Uh-huh.
2019,B,Yeah.
2020,B,That's true.
2021,A,"Uh, but, uh, no"
2022,A,I don't really have a budget at the moment.
2023,A,"Uh, but I have uh, I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month"
2024,A,"and then I don't, usually don't exceed that unless I, unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another, like if I have car expenses"
2025,A,"and then that, then it goes through the moon,"
2026,A,so.
2027,B,"Yeah,"
2028,B,that's sort of a problem.
2029,A,"Yeah,"
2030,A,"so uh, what do"
2031,B,"We're trying, we're trying to, uh,"
2032,B,so far we are in the clear credit wise
2033,B,"but, uh, the other side of it is,"
2034,B,"so, not much on that side of it to add to it."
2035,B,We're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that
2036,B,"but,"
2037,A,So you can afford to get a house?
2038,B,"Yeah,"
2039,B,we'd like to do that some day.
2040,B,We have this dream.
2041,A,Yeah.
2042,B,"But, we don't know how long it will be a dream."
2043,B,"We, we're kind of real, we're real happy that we don't have any debt,"
2044,B,"but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this, uh, economy right now"
2045,B,"so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what, the little bit that we do get, you know, on top of expenses every month."
2046,A,Yeah.
2047,A,"So, what do you and your husband do?"
2048,B,We're missionaries actually.
2049,A,Are you really?
2050,B,"Yeah,"
2051,B,uh-huh.
2052,B,"And, uh, it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have, uh, like, uh, uh, support quota"
2053,A,Um.
2054,B,and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here.
2055,A,No kidding.
2056,B,And it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home.
2057,A,I see.
2058,B,"So,"
2059,A,"Overseas, where would you be going?"
2060,B,"Africa,"
2061,B,Nigeria.
2062,A,Really.
2063,B,Yeah.
2064,A,Really.
2065,A,How long would you be there?
2066,B,About four years.
2067,B,We're career
2068,B,"so, we, we go over seas for four years"
2069,B,and then we come back for a year.
2070,B,"We go over four,"
2071,B,we come back for a year.
2072,A,"With, with what Church?"
2073,B,"Uh, we're with Wycliff Bible Translators."
2074,A,Oh yes.
2075,A,"Yes,"
2076,B,So.
2077,A,"I, uh, I know who they are."
2078,A,"They, uh, they have an office, uh, in in Costa Mesa as I recall."
2079,B,"Yeah,"
2080,B,they could very well
2081,B,"and,"
2082,A,"There, there was, uh, you know, there was a fairly large building that that was well that belongs to them."
2083,A,"So, uh, are you, uh, are you, uh, active in translation?"
2084,B,"Uh, we will be."
2085,B,"I was over, over four years doing language surveying which is the first step."
2086,B,You're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need.
2087,A,Uh-huh
2088,B,"And, uh, came home and got married"
2089,B,and we will go back as translators cause we want to raise a family
2090,B,and it is easier to raise a family as translators.
2091,B,"Well, I always wanted to do translation,"
2092,B,but as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier.
2093,B,"You know they really need surveyors cause you could, you're free to travel anywhere."
2094,B,You don't have kids hanging around you and stuff.
2095,A,"True,"
2096,A,true enough.
2097,A,"So, uh, what, what, uh, what languages do you speak besides English, of course?"
2098,B,"Well, I have a smattering of about ten different ones,"
2099,B,"but there's,"
2100,B,"I'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other, you know,"
2101,B,"since I did you know, complete a survey in one area, I'd switch to the other."
2102,A,Uh-huh
2103,B,"So I know the greetings in about ten, and how to do market stuff,"
2104,B,"but in about, uh, about five I guess, I can do better in it."
2105,B,And my French is pretty good
2106,B,"but it's, uh, French"
2107,B,"so, uh, I'm terrified to speak in, uh in France."
2108,A,In France.
2109,B,"Yeah,"
2110,B,because they're real snobby about their language
2111,B,and French is street French
2112,B,and I just picked it up off the street
2113,B,"and I knew what I was, I knew what I was communicating,"
2114,B,but I didn't know what I was saying.
2115,B,I never sat there and got a direct translation
2116,B,and said something here when I came home and French to somebody
2117,B,"and he paled and said, uh, I'm not going to tell you what you said."
2118,B,"So, since then I have refrained from speaking any French"
2119,B,So.
2120,B,In
2121,A,"Uh,"
2122,B,I don't know what I said to him
2123,B,"but, uh, I didn't ask him either."
2124,A,Must have been terrible.
2125,A,"The, uh,"
2126,A,"was it Henry Macon said that the, the, uh, language was like a man slowly bleeding to death."
2127,A,So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die
2128,A,"and I, it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that."
2129,A,"Free style English is just,"
2130,A,"takes on,"
2131,A,"uh, some of my things,"
2132,A,"I, I'd like to have a short work week you know,"
2133,B,"Oh, okay."
2134,A,"and and we need, you know, better health insurance and you know,"
2135,B,"Okay,"
2136,B,we can start off there.
2137,B,Let's just get started.
2138,A,Okay.
2139,B,"If you don't want to, you know, uh, talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it"
2140,A,Okay.
2141,A,"Okay,"
2142,A,so I just press one then
2143,A,right?
2144,B,Right.
2145,A,"Okay,"
2146,A,ready?
2147,B,Yep.
2148,A,Okay
2149,B,"So, so you think, uh, I think that a short work week is real nice."
2150,B,"Uh, I have a thirty-seven hour work week."
2151,B,How about you?
2152,A,"Well, well right now, I, I'm just a student."
2153,A,"I only work part time,"
2154,A,but I've work in the job force before
2155,B,Uh-huh.
2156,A,and forty hours is just too long.
2157,A,You just don't have any time to do anything.
2158,A,"It seems like, Saturday you get get off,"
2159,A,but Sunday you're getting ready for Monday.
2160,A,"And if we get have a if we could have a thirty-two hour work week, with that happen is that, for every four people we could give another job."
2161,B,Uh-huh.
2162,B,Right.
2163,A,"And then that way everybody would have a three day holiday, okay."
2164,A,"And that way that more, that would make a bigger market."
2165,A,"We'd have, uh, more recreation."
2166,A,People would have time to do it.
2167,A,There would be less of a stress level.
2168,A,"We'd have, we'd have less crime."
2169,A,"We'd have to we'd have to build less prisons, you know, less police force."
2170,B,"Yeah,"
2171,B,it all makes sense to me.
2172,B,"Although, there may be more crime. I mean if people have more leisure time."
2173,B,It's not clear.
2174,B,"And that,"
2175,A,"It, it, that's, that's a possibility."
2176,B,Yeah.
2177,A,"One, one of the problems they're facing now, a lot of people now, is that the health insurance is that the small business can't, can't offer health insurance"
2178,B,Uh-huh.
2179,A,"and it, it's too costly"
2180,A,"and what, what is happening is that they're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it, okay."
2181,A,So they get a specific rate.
2182,A,"Well what happens is that if people start becoming having chronic illness and, and things like that,"
2183,A,"what happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money for one particular,"
2184,B,Right.
2185,A,"it's called a a group,"
2186,A,"well what will, well what happens then is that they cancel, because they just can't cancel an individual."
2187,A,"So they, they have to cancel just like life insurance."
2188,A,They have to cancel everything.
2189,B,Uh-huh.
2190,A,"So what they do is that, that they cancel the insurance"
2191,A,and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage.
2192,B,Right.
2193,B,"So,"
2194,A,"But, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm satisfied with my job."
2195,A,"I'm, I'm an engineering student."
2196,B,Right.
2197,A,And I work for my instructor
2198,A,and I'm I'm not a typical student.
2199,A,"I'm, I'm older."
2200,A,"I'm, I'm in my thirties, okay."
2201,B,Yeah.
2202,A,And so I have a lot of job experience
2203,A,and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants
2204,A,and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose
2205,B,Yeah.
2206,A,"but in, in the same token, it's a very, really enjoyable for me because I don't have to have, you know, nobody breathing down my back"
2207,A,"and and one of the things that I, I really hate about jobs. I don't, I don't like bosses that, that you know want to yell at you and you know are down on your back and all this and that."
2208,B,Uh-huh.
2209,A,"I, I just really can't deal with that"
2210,A,"so,"
2211,B,Yeah
2212,A,"What kind of, what kind of jobs have you done?"
2213,B,"Well, well, I do uh, research in computer science"
2214,B,and I've just been doing that for a few years now
2215,B,"so uh, I, my job has most of the benefits I want."
2216,A,Uh-huh.
2217,B,"Uh, what I really like is, I like being,"
2218,B,"like they send me to conferences for instance, but probably not as much as I'd like"
2219,B,"but, uh, you know, that's just nice being, you know, having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of,"
2220,B,"uh, they also,"
2221,B,"a really important thing to me is when they, uh, they pay for continuing education."
2222,B,"Like, I, I get night courses that they they'll cover right now"
2223,B,and that's really good
2224,A,"Yeah,"
2225,A,that's just great.
2226,A,You have what you might call knowledge power
2227,B,Right.
2228,A,"you know, when when you work at a company whether you know it or not, is that you're categorized."
2229,A,"Some people can be let go and replaced like, uh, say, uh, a typist, uh, somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist."
2230,A,"But if you're a person who, that's doing computer type things and you have the, you have the knowledge, you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system, well then you're you're vital to the company"
2231,B,Uh-huh.
2232,A,and you get more benefits
2233,A,"so. That's where I, I, I'm like,"
2234,A,I'm into computers too
2235,A,"and that's one of the things that I've found in any one, one of these jobs and anything I've done is that to have knowledge."
2236,A,"When you have the knowledge, you're you're not going to, uh, you know, be let go,"
2237,A,be one of the last ones to let go anyway.
2238,B,Right.
2239,A,"So what I,"
2240,A,"Well, what were you saying?"
2241,B,Okay.
2242,B,"I, I think we're started now."
2243,A,"Oh, okay."
2244,B,"Uh, do you want to go ahead and start?"
2245,A,"Uh, well, I haven't really been up to date on a lot of music."
2246,A,I've been in school
2247,A,"and I haven't really gone out, and bought any or listened to much on the, on the radio except for classical"
2248,A,"and, uh,"
2249,B,"Well, you like classical music?"
2250,A,Yes.
2251,B,"Uh, I like classical music."
2252,B,I like rock and roll.
2253,A,Uh-huh.
2254,B,I like country and western
2255,A,Okay.
2256,B,"Uh, I, I like all kinds"
2257,B,"I like, I like different things about each one of them."
2258,A,"Well, I like most of them except for country music."
2259,B,Oh you don't like country?
2260,A,No.
2261,A,"I think I, I might like dancing to it"
2262,A,but I don't like listening to it.
2263,B,"The, the kind of country I like is kind of the older country music. Not the, not the kind like Kenny Rodgers and stuff like that."
2264,A,Oh.
2265,B,"That's, uh, that's a little bit to, uh,"
2266,B,"they're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing,"
2267,B,you know what I mean?
2268,A,Uh-huh.
2269,A,what's the old country music like?
2270,B,"Oh, like, like Hank Williams."
2271,B,Like the old Hank Williams.
2272,B,"Even, even Hank  Williams, Junior is real good stuff."
2273,A,Uh-huh.
2274,B,The kind that
2275,A,"Oh, okay."
2276,B,"uh, this stuff, makes you cry it sounds so sad"
2277,B,I mean you
2278,A,That's the kind you like you mean?
2279,B,Yeah.
2280,B,sometimes I do.
2281,B,"I mean, not all the time."
2282,A,Oh.
2283,A,"Oh, okay."
2284,A,"Well, I guess I, I like the blues a lot"
2285,A,and I guess you could say it's similar as far as  the kind of the way they do it.
2286,B,Yes.
2287,B,"And I  I, I do too."
2288,B,I also like jazz.
2289,A,Yeah.
2290,A,"Me too, too."
2291,A,I guess I like
2292,A,except heavy metal
2293,A,"and, uh, most rap I don't like."
2294,A,Yeah.
2295,B,Yeah.
2296,B,"You're, you're about like I am"
2297,B,"I, I can't, watch M T V anymore."
2298,B,I used to love M T V.
2299,A,"Oh, okay."
2300,B,"And I can, I can barely watch anymore because, uh, they have this heavy metal stuff on there"
2301,B,"and, and I can't even, you know, I can't like that."
2302,A,Yeah.
2303,B,"And, and I liked, uh, Aerosmith and Led Zepplin and, uh you know, and, uh, jeez who else is there. Van Halen."
2304,A,Uh-huh.
2305,A,Okay.
2306,A,Okay.
2307,A,Yeah.
2308,B,"Now I like, I like groups like that."
2309,B,"But when you get, uh,"
2310,B,"I, I even like Guns and Roses, some of their stuff."
2311,A,Uh-huh.
2312,B,"But, uh, some of these groups now like Slaughter"
2313,A,"Oh, I, I really haven't listened to that"
2314,B,Some of them are just really rough.
2315,B,"So, so you went to school then in,"
2316,B,"I'm surprised you didn't go to, to any parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff"
2317,B,"or,"
2318,A,"Well, uh, I used to a long time ago"
2319,A,"but since I've started back into school now, I haven't really done that much."
2320,A,I've been pretty busy. Uh
2321,B,Okay.
2322,A,"but, uh,"
2323,A,so no
2324,A,I haven't.
2325,A,"I, you know, I used to go out and dance a lot"
2326,A,but I don't do that anymore either
2327,A,So.
2328,B,"Oh, I see."
2329,B,Are you married at all?
2330,A,No
2331,B,Okay
2332,A,"I've just been real busy with, with lots of other things."
2333,B,"Well, how old are you?"
2334,A,Twenty-eight.
2335,B,Okay.
2336,B,"So, you, you were out of you went to school for awhile and quit. Then went back."
2337,A,"Well, no."
2338,A,"I, I went to school and got a degree"
2339,A,and then I worked for awhile.
2340,A,"And then I just started, I started back a year and a half ago."
2341,A,Changed directions.
2342,B,"Oh, okay."
2343,A,Yeah.
2344,A,How old are you?
2345,B,"Oh, I'm, uh, twenty-eight"
2346,B,I was born in sixty-three
2347,B,I guess we're  the same age then.
2348,A,"Oh, okay"
2349,A,All right.
2350,A,Yeah.
2351,A,"And, uh, I didn't really start getting into music until I went to college because, uh, my parents didn't really have music in the house."
2352,A,Put it that way.
2353,B,"Oh,"
2354,B,Were they religious?
2355,A,Yes.
2356,B,"uh, I see."
2357,B,"I,"
2358,A,"So, I'm always behind."
2359,A,"I'm, I'm not, I'm never really up to date on all that stuff."
2360,A,"But I know what I like when it's, uh, when I like a sound. A certain kind of sound,"
2361,A,yeah.
2362,B,My parents were very musical.
2363,B,"My mother had a piano in the, in the house."
2364,A,"Uh,"
2365,A,Uh-huh.
2366,B,"My father likes, uh, country western music."
2367,A,Okay.
2368,B,"He's from, uh, West Virginia."
2369,B,So that's what he grew up listening to.
2370,A,Uh-huh.
2371,B,And he's always liked it
2372,B,"and, and, you know, he's probably about fifty-three years old now,"
2373,B,so he grew up like in the late fifties
2374,B,"and you know, when they had that, the Elvis Presley music and stuff like that.  And that kind of rock and roll"
2375,A,Huh.
2376,A,"Yeah,"
2377,A,yeah.
2378,B,so he likes that.
2379,B,And my mom always liked that kind of stuff.
2380,B,"My mom likes like, uh, Doris Day, you know."
2381,A,"Oh, really."
2382,B,"She always had those, these old Doris Day records and stuff like that, though."
2383,A,"Oh, well."
2384,B,"So, you know, I grew up listening to that stuff."
2385,A,Yeah.
2386,B,"But, uh, I could see why you went, uh, you know, I could see why you were kind of sheltered  I guess from, from music."
2387,A,Yeah.
2388,A,"Well, I, I do play the piano, you know"
2389,B,"Oh, okay."
2390,A,"But, uh, I, I like the, uh, early seventies, late sixties rock. Kind of stuff, the old stuff."
2391,B,"Oh, okay."
2392,A,"And, uh,"
2393,B,"Yeah,"
2394,B,so do I.
2395,A,"Uh,"
2396,B,"Do you like, uh, like Van Halen or anything like that?"
2397,B,Or how about Brian Adams?
2398,A,"what kind of music is, does what  songs does he play?"
2399,B,"It, it,"
2400,B,"THIS LOVE CUTS LIKE A KNIFE. Uh, SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE."
2401,A,Uh-huh.
2402,A,I think I've heard SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE.
2403,B,Yeah.
2404,B,He sings that.
2405,A,Yeah.
2406,B,"He's, he's from Canada."
2407,A,Okay.
2408,A,"I'm not, I'm not very good at remembering the, uh titles,"
2409,B,The titles and artists.
2410,A,"yeah,"
2411,A,"but I can remember this, the song."
2412,A,Yeah.
2413,B,"Well, do do you watch music television, M T V at all? Or V H One?"
2414,A,Yeah
2415,A,"No,"
2416,A,I don't watch T V much at all.
2417,B,Okay.
2418,A,So.
2419,B,"do, do you get cable?"
2420,A,No.
2421,B,"Oh,"
2422,B,okay.
2423,B,"That's, that's"
2424,A,No.
2425,B,you have to get cable to get those stations anyhow.
2426,A,Yeah.
2427,A,So.
2428,B,"But, uh, yeah."
2429,B,I like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos.
2430,A,Uh-huh.
2431,B,I like watching that kind of thing.
2432,B,"It's,"
2433,A,"Do you like, uh, like someone recent? Like Enya?"
2434,A,Have you ever head of her.
2435,A,She's not rock
2436,A,"but she, she's from Ireland."
2437,B,"No,"
2438,B,I haven't heard her.
2439,B,"Oh, okay."
2440,A,"And, uh, she's gotten some, uh, she's been on like the top ten, I guess, or whatever."
2441,B,"Oh, really."
2442,A,"She, she did"
2443,A,Okay.
2444,B,"So how serious is the, subject of crime in your area?"
2445,A,"Well, needless to say, here in Washington, D C this is the war zone."
2446,A,"Uh, D C around here stands for drug capital or death capital."
2447,A,"It's, uh, it's really bad here."
2448,A,"Uh, for example, the, uh, local high school, uh, they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns"
2449,B,Jeez.
2450,A,"and they're starting to, uh, get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school, of all things."
2451,A,"So,"
2452,B,"Well, luckily, it hasn't gotten that bad here."
2453,A,Uh-huh.
2454,B,"Uh, San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime."
2455,A,Uh-huh.
2456,B,"Uh, but it's on the uprise, especially in a lot of the, uh, outlying agricultural towns. Uh, because you end up having a lot of gangs forming, uh, largely around the Hispanic core."
2457,A,Uh-huh.
2458,A,Uh-huh.
2459,B,"Uh, it seems to be that, uh, gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions."
2460,A,"Uh-huh,"
2461,A,right.
2462,A,"That's how they, uh, they bind themselves together in groups, I guess"
2463,A,"and, uh,"
2464,B,Yeah.
2465,A,"Now, the,"
2466,A,"interestingly enough, I don't think we have here, a, a lot of gangs, but, uh, only a couple, uh of, not a whole large group of them, but, uh, just a few. Most of them centered around, uh, drug territory."
2467,B,Uh-huh.
2468,B,Uh-huh.
2469,A,"And so they're protecting their economic interests, I guess."
2470,B,Yeah
2471,A,"And, uh, nowadays the latest thing I've, I've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as, uh, crimes involving stealing cars is that, instead of stealing, uh, cars like at night, breaking into them or whatever, they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up,"
2472,A,"and then as you get out of the car, they just, uh, step up and, uh, take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house."
2473,B,"Well, that's efficient."
2474,A,"Yeah,"
2475,A,"that's the, uh, latest thing."
2476,A,That way there's no damage to the car or anything.
2477,A,They just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want.
2478,B,They're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort.
2479,A,Uh-huh.
2480,A,Right.
2481,A,"Just wait for you to drive to your house,"
2482,A,you get out
2483,A,and they get in
2484,A,off they go with your car.
2485,B,Wow.
2486,A,"So it's,"
2487,A,"uh, I think they call it car jacking around here"
2488,B,"Yeah,"
2489,B,"yeah,"
2490,B,I'd heard that phrase.
2491,A,"Uh-huh,"
2492,A,"yeah,"
2493,A,"that's kind of the latest thing,"
2494,A,"but every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides,"
2495,A,"so it's, uh, it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here,"
2496,A,"we're from, uh, I'm from Ohio"
2497,A,and my wife's from Florida
2498,A,"so,"
2499,B,Uh-huh.
2500,A,"And we've just come from twenty years in the military and, uh, which is an entirely different environment,"
2501,A,"so this is a whole new thing for for us to, to have to put up with"
2502,A,"and it's, uh, really scary sometimes."
2503,B,"Yeah,"
2504,B,"there aren't that many, places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays."
2505,A,Right.
2506,A,And it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school
2507,B,Uh-huh.
2508,A,"and, uh, of course, the mayor, uh, of D C is having a real problem, uh, trying to,"
2509,A,"what do you do to, to reduce crime in a, in a major city like D C where it's a way of life for everybody."
2510,A,"It's, uh, I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem."
2511,A,"I don't know what, what the solution is."
2512,A,"Uh, there's no way they can stop the drugs,"
2513,A,and that's what's causing all the killing.
2514,B,"Well, uh, there's a couple of things that I've heard,"
2515,B,"uh, most of them are fairly, uh, radical in terms of what you'd have to do."
2516,A,Uh-huh.
2517,A,Uh-huh.
2518,B,"Uh, course the, the reason that, that these kids tend to, to turn toward the drugs and everything else seems to be just, you know, the, the, the end results of, of poverty and, and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else"
2519,A,Uh-huh.
2520,B,"because, I mean, you know, the parents aren't making a living at anything."
2521,A,Right
2522,B,"Uh,"
2523,A,"And they see all their friends and neighbors, uh,"
2524,B,And they're accidental parents half the time anyway.
2525,A,"Yeah,"
2526,A,and their friends are driving Mercedes
2527,A,"and, so it's actually,"
2528,A,they grow up with that as their way of life
2529,A,"and, uh, I think, uh, to a large extent, they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised."
2530,B,"It's illegal,"
2531,B,but it's not wrong because all their friends do it.
2532,A,Right
2533,A,"exactly,"
2534,A,so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes
2535,A,"and they they say, well, it's, it's the law that's, uh, got to be changed instead of their way of life,"
2536,B,Yeah.
2537,A,"so, I don't know,"
2538,A,it's
2539,A,I'm glad it's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it's not easy.
2540,B,"Well I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of, of an actual solution to the problem. Uh"
2541,A,Uh-huh.
2542,B,"the, the social, the other social problems wouldn't, wouldn't go away."
2543,A,Right.
2544,B,"Uh,"
2545,A,They've always been with us.
2546,B,"I mean, there's, there's been a lot of, uh,"
2547,B,"and I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus,"
2548,B,"but then, the more I thought about it, the more sense it made, is that, uh, alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else."
2549,A,Uh-huh.
2550,A,Uh-huh.
2551,B,"Uh, and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow,"
2552,A,Right.
2553,A,"Okay,"
2554,A,looks like we're ready to go.
2555,A,"Capital punishment, uh,"
2556,A,"the problem I have with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime,"
2557,A,but I don't think that it really actually does that.
2558,A,"I don't think it deters anybody, because most of the time crimes are, uh, are committed with a, without any thought to the consequences"
2559,A,"and they don't think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe I shouldn't do this, uh, because, uh, I might get the gas chamber or something like that."
2560,A,They worry about it afterwards
2561,A,and then they try and get out of it.
2562,A,"And, uh, how about you"
2563,B,"Well, I think that in some cases, it is warranted."
2564,A,"Uh-huh,"
2565,A,"I do, too,"
2566,A,yep.
2567,B,"And I don't,"
2568,B,I think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not.
2569,A,"Uh-huh,"
2570,A,"yeah,"
2571,A,you still have to do it.
2572,A,"I, I,"
2573,B,"I mean I mean, I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer"
2574,A,Uh-huh.
2575,B,"or,"
2576,A,"So you're in, you're in favor of capital punishment, then."
2577,B,"Well, for some things."
2578,A,Right.
2579,B,"I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood,"
2580,A,Uh-huh.
2581,A,Uh-huh.
2582,A,"Needs to be punished or, uh, eliminated from society."
2583,B,"I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again."
2584,A,Right.
2585,A,And then do it all over again.
2586,A,Uh-huh.
2587,B,"And I don't think that, that rehabilitation is effective."
2588,A,Right.
2589,A,"Have to agree with you,"
2590,A,and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also.
2591,A,"I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes,"
2592,A,"but, I tend to agree with you that, uh, we should have it"
2593,A,"I just, I don't know that it's always effective"
2594,A,"but I guess we, uh, we're kind of stuck with it."
2595,A,"It's, it's a difficult, uh, problem, isn't it, to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime, uh,"
2596,B,"But, then, you know, I think that, that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. You know, just, like, for example, uh, you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them"
2597,A,Uh-huh.
2598,A,Uh-huh.
2599,A,"Right,"
2600,A,uh-huh.
2601,B,"and I don't think, that would really warrant capital punishment."
2602,A,"Uh-huh,"
2603,A,"huh. Do you think they should be punished at all, or, uh, like go to prison, uh,"
2604,A,because they're not really a danger to society.
2605,A,"It was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that."
2606,B,Uh it is to a certain extent
2607,A,Uh-huh.
2608,B,"but I think,"
2609,B,"I don't know because,"
2610,A,"I know they put, uh, put them in jail sometimes, I guess. Uh,"
2611,B,I think in
2612,B,"and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and, and the extent of the abuse and, and if another alternative was available."
2613,A,Uh-huh.
2614,A,Uh-huh.
2615,A,Um.
2616,A,Uh-huh.
2617,A,"You know, now, I wonder what you think about this"
2618,A,"and, uh, unfortunately, we, we don't get to do it,"
2619,A,"but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment."
2620,A,"So if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to, uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person."
2621,A,"And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to, to get revenge on them"
2622,A,"and, uh, but, I, I don't think that's done much anywhere"
2623,A,That's kind of drastic punishment.
2624,B,"Well, I think that would be kind of drastic punishment."
2625,A,Right.
2626,B,"And,"
2627,A,Might make you feel better
2628,A,but
2629,B,"But, one thing, I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated."
2630,A,Uh-huh.
2631,A,Right.
2632,B,"But, like I said, if, if someone is, is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society."
2633,A,Uh-huh.
2634,A,Right.
2635,A,Uh-huh.
2636,A,"Right,"
2637,A,because they're a danger to everybody else.
2638,A,"Huh, that's interesting."
2639,A,"I have to, uh agree with that."
2640,B,"But,"
2641,A,"There's a lot of folks, probably, that are in prison that, uh, that aren't really a danger to society, huh,"
2642,A,"and, uh,"
2643,B,And a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison.
2644,A,Right.
2645,A,"Right,"
2646,A,probably more of them then the other way around
2647,A,Interesting.
2648,A,"I don't, I don't, not sure"
2649,A,"I, I'm in Washington, D C or at least very close to it."
2650,A,"I'm not sure what kind of, uh, capital punishment we have here."
2651,B,"Well, I know in North Carolina, we do have capital punishment."
2652,A,Uh-huh.
2653,B,And I'm I'm from South Carolina.
2654,A,"Well, we, in, in, in our family, have been pretty remiss in trying to, uh, you know, keep track of, uh, daily finances."
2655,A,"Uh, the, uh, way back, what, twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer, I did what everybody else does, which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks, and, you know, checkbooks and all this kind of thing"
2656,A,and we kept that going for about a month
2657,A,and it became so onerous that we gave up on it
2658,B,Uh-huh.
2659,B,That sounds about right
2660,A,"You know, so, uh, the only thing we're, you know, that we do now is, uh, I keep a, a little spread sheet of, uh, what I call the net worth calculation which is just the, the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth."
2661,A,"Uh, and I only update that, oh I don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. Every three months. Just, basically when the statements come in. You know. Just to see whether or not we're falling, you know, getting ahead, falling behind or staying even or what."
2662,B,Uh-huh.
2663,B,Right.
2664,A,"Uh, that's really about, you know, the extent of, uh, of the kind of, uh, financial score keeping that we're doing."
2665,B,Uh
2666,B,"Well it's kind of difficult for me. Because right now, uh, like most teachers, I'm laid off"
2667,B,and
2668,A,Huh.
2669,A,"Oh dear, that's terrible."
2670,B,"so, um, I spend most, you know,"
2671,B,I substitute a lot.
2672,A,Uh-huh.
2673,B,"So it's a lot, it's very hard on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not, to try to keep track of finances."
2674,A,Uh-huh.
2675,B,"And, but I know how much I have to bring in a month"
2676,B,And that's about it.
2677,B,That's about as far as we go.
2678,B,"And then anything extra is, you know, more or less split up between all of us. And just thrown in the kitty, more or less, for a rainy day"
2679,A,Uh-huh.
2680,A,"Oh, I see."
2681,A,"Are you, are you married?"
2682,A,"Are you living with a bunch of, with, with people that you're sharing expenses?"
2683,B,"Uh, no."
2684,B,I'm a single mother.
2685,B,I have three children.
2686,A,"Oh, I see,"
2687,A,uh-huh.
2688,B,"So, uh, right now, we're on, we get you know, aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it."
2689,B,And my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support
2690,A,Oh dear.
2691,B,So right now I know what I'm getting from the state
2692,B,"and, uh, I have to balance, more or less, what I get from the state with my bills and, uh, you know, try to work as many days as possible. Any time they call me in."
2693,A,Uh-huh.
2694,B,But I still have to figure out.
2695,B,"If I work too many days, then I lose all my state aid"
2696,B,and if I don't work enough days then I don't get enough to meet the bills
2697,B,and it's like a juggling act every single month.
2698,A,Uh-huh.
2699,B,Like this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in
2700,B,but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation.
2701,A,I see.
2702,B,"So, you know, the four days before, they only have a four day week"
2703,A,Uh-huh.
2704,B,and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in
2705,A,"oh, I see."
2706,B,They don't like to be absent before a vacation.
2707,A,"Oh, sure."
2708,B,"But we're shopping around as far as, well I'm shopping around as far as trying to get, uh, that's why I'm doing this, to get some extra money. And, uh, getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts."
2709,A,Uh-huh.
2710,B,My kids are in Boy Scouts
2711,B,so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts
2712,B,because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me.
2713,B,So it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit.
2714,B,"But, you know, we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul."
2715,B,I guess we're in the situation that a lot of middle-class Americans are in.
2716,A,Uh-huh.
2717,A,"Yeah,"
2718,A,"you're the first, you know, uh,"
2719,A,"my next door neighbor just lost his job. In a, you know, one of these, uh,"
2720,B,"Oh, my Lord."
2721,A,"his company went broke. I mean went, you know, bankrupt."
2722,A,"Actually, it was a subsidiary of a, of an outfit called U S Shoe or something."
2723,A,it was a computer subsidiary.
2724,A,I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company.
2725,B,Really.
2726,A,"But, uh, you know, they just folded it up and, uh, uh, told him to,"
2727,A,"they took the top management and gave them jobs with the, with the corporate, uh, at the corporate front office"
2728,B,Uh-huh.
2729,A,and everybody else was sent packing.
2730,B,Oh
2731,A,"Uh, hang on one second"
2732,A,I've got
2733,B,Sure.
2734,A,"uh, somebody was knocking on my door here."
2735,A,"Uh, it sounds like, in a certain sense, at least at the present,"
2736,A,"I mean, it sounds, sounds terrible to say,"
2737,A,"but at the present stage, you probably are even more in the market for a, a budgetary thing than, than most people probably might be. In terms of keeping, keeping score of input and output."
2738,B,Right.
2739,B,Uh-huh.
2740,B,Definitely.
2741,A,"Do you have, do you have a computer at home"
2742,A,"or,"
2743,B,"Uh, yes"
2744,B,we do.
2745,B,"And we try  to,"
2746,A,Uh-huh.
2747,B,"you know, I keep track of every penny. And, more or less, enter it in."
2748,A,Uh-huh.
2749,B,Every single day I'm at the computer.
2750,A,I see.
2751,B,"And, it's like, okay, what do we have left, what do we have to pay, what  have we paid this month. What hasn't come in yet, you know"
2752,A,Uh-huh.
2753,A,Yeah.
2754,A,"Have you, do you use a standard, uh, a standard spread sheet"
2755,A,"or I mean,"
2756,A,"Okay,"
2757,A,"this topic is, is Russia a threat to our security?"
2758,A,I think they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time.
2759,A,how do you feel about it?
2760,B,"Well, they do have, uh, a major internal problem"
2761,B,"Everybody wants to defect,"
2762,B,and I can understand why.
2763,B,"Um, I think their biggest problem is just, you know, obtaining food to live,"
2764,B,"so when you have the basic needs, uh, being unmet I don't think you think globally as far as, you know, being a threat to other people in the world."
2765,B,"So, as soon as they get their, their own home country taken care of, then they'll consider, what they can do with the rest of the world."
2766,A,I believe Communism is very much waning
2767,A,"It's, uh, pretty much on the way out of the door, insofar as the strong hold that they used to have,"
2768,A,"and the Russian people are all realizing that the Communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world,"
2769,A,and their rebellions right now is the result of that
2770,A,"If they can get the army, or the military to sway to their side, I think that, uh, it will be on the way out eventually."
2771,A,"It's just a matter of time, because, in the Baltic States they have already massacred so many people who protested,"
2772,A,"and that hasn't set too well with their diplomacy for the, regarding the, uh, outcome of their affairs"
2773,A,What's your synopsis?
2774,B,"Well, I do, I do realize that, uh, uh, the Bush Administration isn't too happy with, with how they're handling their internal, uh, strife, you know, as far as diplomacy is concerned"
2775,B,"I think it's been a good, a good positive direction for uh, the Soviets as far as Yeltsin is concerned."
2776,B,"You know, he was, uh, allowed to,"
2777,B,"what,"
2778,B,"in his, in the Congress they, they gave him more power as far as his republic in Russia is concerned, which is, gives him more power overall, which I think is a good sign that there will be some, you know,"
2779,B,"politically speaking, you know, he's going to have more power,"
2780,B,and I think it's a step in the right direction.
2781,B,"I think Gorbachev realizes that he's got a, a major uh, uh, power figure, you know, competing against him,"
2782,B,"and I think it's going to be pretty close to his demise if he doesn't follow suit with Yeltsin as far as, uh, realizing,"
2783,B,"well, he does realize it, you know, with the fact that they reduced the uh, or they, increased the prices on their food, food and goods."
2784,A,Uh-huh.
2785,B,"Uh. It,"
2786,A,"I think that it went up a thousand percent on most,"
2787,B,yeah.
2788,B,that's incredible
2789,B,"but they had to, uh, go in the direction of a market driven economy,"
2790,B,"and, and they had to bite the bullet for that."
2791,B,"So that's a good move on, on Gorbachev's part in doing that."
2792,A,Uh-huh
2793,B,"So,"
2794,A,"but Gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that, he's moving towards a two to three party system of government that, nor eliminating or diminishing the Communist power,"
2795,A,"and I guess that's where Yeltsin steps in, so far as his politics of government goes, uh,"
2796,A,"but I don't know how convinced the people are of him yet, myself."
2797,B,"Well, that's all they got right now."
2798,B,That's their ray of hope.
2799,A,Uh-huh.
2800,B,"So, you know, they'll go with you know, whoever comes through for them."
2801,B,"I, it, it's just that, the weird thing is, is that Gorbachev is the one that opened the floodgates, as far as with glasnost and perestroika and stuff,"
2802,B,"and I think he's got between the Old Guard and, in and the new, uh, glasnost."
2803,B,"Uh, I think it's kind of escalated to a point where it's out of control."
2804,A,Uh-huh.
2805,B,"And I think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how, in order to keep the peace on, peace on both sides."
2806,B,"So I think that's where you know, kind of where he's stuck."
2807,B,You know what I'm saying?
2808,A,Yeah.
2809,A,"Uh, I understand."
2810,B,"And that's the, that's the situation that he finds himself in,"
2811,B,"and you know, he's a tough guy,"
2812,B,"I mean, he's been through it"
2813,B,"So I have no doubt that he'll,"
2814,B,"I mean, I, I think overall he's been a, a good figure for the Soviet Union."
2815,B,"I mean, I think his intentions and his ideals are, are uh, well intentioned."
2816,A,Uh-huh.
2817,B,"And in the long-term,"
2818,B,"but I just think that because of the basic needs that the people don't have,"
2819,B,"I think that, uh, makes the problem most severe, and makes him look, look worse that what his, um, what his ideals are, personally."
2820,A,I agree.
2821,A,"What's bad for the Soviet system is that they have the resources to grow and produce their food,"
2822,A,but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should.
2823,B,"I think it's, I think it's a lot of, uh, oh, how do you put it? bureaucracy and, and, uh, one thing, and then all the corruption."
2824,B,"I think there's a, a large amount of corruption on the, the have and the have-nots. You know,"
2825,A,Yeah
2826,A,"That's probably more true than, a lot of people realize."
2827,B,I I know you're going to have that with every society.
2828,B,"At least we're more blatant about it,"
2829,B,"but it's very secret,"
2830,B,and it's been going on for years.
2831,B,"I mean, you can't change things overnight."
2832,A,Uh-huh.
2833,B,"And, but if it gets to a point where people can't survive, I mean, there's revolution. You know,"
2834,B,and that's
2835,A,It seems to be headed in that direction too.
2836,B,Yeah
2837,B,big time
2838,B,major
2839,B,"but you know, that's, that's what happens when, you know, the cork blows"
2840,B,and you can't handle it anymore.
2841,B,"I mean, that's that's the way the world, uh, you know, revolves that way"
2842,A,"and uh, I think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things, too."
2843,A,"They,"
2844,A,"probably not enough,"
2845,A,but I'm sure I lot of it's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind of what they're missing out on.
2846,B,"Yeah,"
2847,B,"I think they're starting to realize,"
2848,B,"but I, I just don't think they have the resources, if you were to compare, uh, the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fact machines, Fax machines and cellular phones, and state of the art equipment that we are so used to."
2849,B,"I don't think they even realize what's out there, and to what extent."
2850,A,"Yeah,"
2851,A,I'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items
2852,B,"Yeah,"
2853,B,the major conveniences of life
2854,A,Yeah
2855,A,"what we consider just, I don't normal everyday things to them is real luxury. Which is unfortunate for them,"
2856,B,Yeah
2857,A,"and of course, most of us, we don't really appreciate what we've got because we've been so used to it."
2858,B,This is true.
2859,B,This is very true.
2860,B,"And we,"
2861,B,"it's human, it's human nature though to take things for granted"
2862,B,"and it kind of, you know,"
2863,B,"when you've lost something or, or uh, uh, don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize, you know, what's out there and what, you know, what you have and what you don't have."
2864,A,Yeah
2865,A,I agree
2866,B,"So the original question, do we think they're a threat to our, you know, a security threat?"
2867,A,Yeah.
2868,B,"Um, yes and no."
2869,A,"Yeah,"
2870,A,I can go with that answer too
2871,A,"The only yes I could go to is if uh, a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to, to a nuclear exchange,"
2872,A,"but I don't even see that occurring. Uh, because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be to I guess."
2873,B,"Um, no."
2874,B,"Well, I don't really feel that the Soviets really want to blow up the world."
2875,B,"I mean, um, we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as, as nonfeeling machine type people,"
2876,B,and they're people just like us.
2877,B,"I mean you know, they get up everyday,"
2878,A,Uh-huh.
2879,B,"and they put their pants on the same way,"
2880,B,"and they have to eat and everything else,"
2881,B,and I just don't feel that ...
2882,A,Okay.
2883,A,"Well why don't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask you what do you,"
2884,B,"Do you have any elderly relatives currently in an, uh, nursing home now?"
2885,A,"Yes,"
2886,A,I do.
2887,B,Do you?
2888,B,I have a grandmother.
2889,B,She's a hundred and two.
2890,A,Oh my gosh.
2891,B,She'll be a hundred and three in August.
2892,A,Uh-huh.
2893,B,And we decide not to put her in a nursing home.
2894,B,She lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town
2895,B,and then my sister takes care of her.
2896,A,Uh-huh.
2897,B,"She, even though she is a hundred and two, she still has all of her faculties."
2898,A,Right.
2899,B,She still has her snap.
2900,B,She takes care of her own business.
2901,B,"This is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker,"
2902,B,"but with somebody that needs around the clock care,"
2903,B,I have seen my family age.
2904,A,Right.
2905,B,"I have seen them in the,"
2906,B,she's been there ten years now.
2907,B,"And I have seen them age twenty in the time and, and with the expense and everything,"
2908,A,Yeah.
2909,B,"I I still think it is worth it if you, if you had a good nursing home"
2910,B,"and they needed some quality care,"
2911,B,I would put someone in a nursing home.
2912,A,Right.
2913,A,My mother-in-law finally.
2914,A,They had to make a family decision.
2915,A,There's seven children in my husband's family
2916,A,and fortunately four of them live in the same home town
2917,A,and she has Alzheimer's.
2918,A,"It was getting where she was getting dangerous. I mean letting strangers in and things like this,"
2919,B,Uh-huh.
2920,A,but they were very fortunate.
2921,A,It's a small town
2922,A,and she happens to room with one of the doctor's mothers
2923,A,and then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time
2924,B,"Oh, well that's good."
2925,A,but she really doesn't.
2926,A,"Nobody thought she would adjust,"
2927,A,but she has adjusted beautifully.
2928,B,"Oh, that is great."
2929,A,But then I am also facing my father who is very sick
2930,A,and my mother and father reside in Colorado.
2931,A,She's been taking care of him.
2932,A,I don't know how much longer this can last
2933,A,and at that point because he requires round the clock.
2934,A,He can't do anything without her.
2935,A,He doesn't know when to take his medicine
2936,A,and it's really sad
2937,A,"and I have thought if something would happen to my mother for, uh,"
2938,A,my brothers are not interested in helping me
2939,A,so I would have to move him down here.
2940,A,"That way,"
2941,A,I want to see the nursing home. If I have to put him into one.
2942,A,"You know, where I can go see it."
2943,A,"I, I'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado."
2944,A,"And,"
2945,B,"Oh, why yeah."
2946,B,I am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas.
2947,A,Yes.
2948,A,"And some of them are limited care too where people can do, uh,"
2949,A,"like they have apartment styles,"
2950,A,but that wouldn't work for him.
2951,A,I think he is beyond that.
2952,A,"Where if you need help you can get it,"
2953,A,but basically people kind of have a small apartment
2954,A,and doctors are available if they need them.
2955,B,Uh-huh.
2956,B,"I, I  know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in Austin."
2957,A,"And allows,"
2958,A,Yeah.
2959,A,Yeah.
2960,A,"Well, the only problem with these are that they are very expensive."
2961,A,"Of course, I guess all nursing homes there is"
2962,A,"but,"
2963,B,"And the bad thing about it, before you can get any kind of government help, you just practically have, well you have to be a pauper."
2964,A,Right.
2965,B,"It, it takes every penny."
2966,B,They want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care.
2967,A,Yeah.
2968,A,Right.
2969,B,And that's the sad part about it.
2970,A,Yeah.
2971,A,"I, uh,"
2972,A,"yeah,"
2973,A,and I think a lot of people who do it now.
2974,A,In Colorado it's interesting.
2975,A,I talked to my mother.
2976,A,They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home.
2977,A,And my mother could make it on that.
2978,A,What she probably would do is disburse the money to me
2979,A,and then I would send it back to her
2980,A,so that's what would happen.
2981,B,Uh-huh.
2982,B,I think that's what most people do.
2983,B,"You just have to give it, everything away."
2984,A,Yeah.
2985,A,It's unfortunate.
2986,B,"I, I work at a brokerage firm"
2987,B,"and I have seen so many people that just have to gift, you know, their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home."
2988,A,Right.
2989,A,Yeah.
2990,A,It's frightening.
2991,A,"And I guess, uh, I don't know how old you are."
2992,A,I'm forty-six.
2993,A,"You know, we're the generation moving into this"
2994,A,and I don't know how our kids are going to take care of us. You know.
2995,B,I can't imagine.
2996,B,I'm twenty-nine.
2997,A,Yeah.
2998,B,"And everybody in my family has always had,"
2999,B,we don't have any children.
3000,B,"Everybody that has, has them later in life."
3001,A,Yeah.
3002,B,"So, my, my mother and my father are in their late sixties."
3003,B,"So, I mean, they're not that far away."
3004,A,Right.
3005,A,I also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise
3006,A,and he's still living at home
3007,A,and I don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are.
3008,B,"Oh, I know."
3009,A,"And so, it's kind of,"
3010,A,"you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations,"
3011,A,"but it, something will have to change as more and more of us get older."
3012,A,"Uh, luckily, if we could be like your grandmother, I, uh you know, I would love to live to a hundred and two if I were okay."
3013,A,But  you see these people in their seventies
3014,B,"It,"
3015,B,but yeah.
3016,B,Most people aren't.
3017,A,"yeah,"
3018,A,most aren't.
3019,A,That's the problem.
3020,B,And that's the bad thing.
3021,B,I would hate to have lived so long.
3022,B,She lived by herself.
3023,B,"My grandfather passed away before I was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety, ninety-one. And just did everything,"
3024,A,That's incredible.
3025,A,Hello Ann.
3026,B,Hello Chuck.
3027,A,"Uh, the other day, I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling"
3028,B,Uh-huh.
3029,A,"and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places"
3030,B,Uh-huh.
3031,A,"and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste."
3032,B,"Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation."
3033,A,"Well, it's not too new."
3034,B,Right.
3035,B,"So, what what is the E P A recommending now?"
3036,A,"Oh, they really didn't propose any solutions."
3037,A,"Actually, they were, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A."
3038,B,Uh-huh.
3039,A,"But, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down"
3040,A,"and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of, of news print."
3041,A,"He was talking about, uh, the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print"
3042,B,Yeah.
3043,A,and they could sell it for a while.
3044,A,They were able to sell it for some amount per ton
3045,A,"and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling, they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away."
3046,B,Right.
3047,B,"That's a, that's a common problem though."
3048,B,"That it seems, that has happened in Dallas as well as New York"
3049,B,and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house
3050,B,"and after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either, I suppose."
3051,A,Yeah.
3052,A,"We're doing some here in, in Cash Valley, the community here."
3053,B,Uh-huh.
3054,A,"There's, uh, we've actually got a kind of a nice set up."
3055,A,"We've got a couple of plants here that actually take, uh, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation"
3056,B,Right.
3057,A,and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside.
3058,B,"Well, that's good."
3059,A,"So one of the real keys, it sounds like, to getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it."
3060,B,Right.
3061,B,"There has to be, uh, a reuse for it."
3062,B,"I mean, that's why they recycle."
3063,B,"The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that, uh, the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. Uh, everything from, uh, waste baskets to carpet to the no stick, I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet"
3064,A,Uh-huh.
3065,B,"and, uh, I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days"
3066,B,and they're making clothes now that are recycled.
3067,B,Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that.
3068,A,And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama
3069,A,and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government.
3070,A,"One was like, environmental protection"
3071,A,"and the other one was, oh, I can't remember what,"
3072,A,"but the basic idea, it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill"
3073,B,Uh-huh.
3074,A,"and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing,"
3075,A,"he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them."
3076,B,Oh really.
3077,A,"He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space"
3078,B,Right.
3079,A,"and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling,"
3080,A,"but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity."
3081,B,Huh.
3082,A,So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.
3083,B,"Well, it's carbon"
3084,B,"so that makes sense,"
3085,B,"like a carbon fuel of some sort,"
3086,B,but what  what about emissions?
3087,A,Yeah.
3088,A,And it's more than even paper or something like that.
3089,A,There is more energy in it per pound or whatever.
3090,A,Well that was he didn't deal with that.
3091,B,Oh.
3092,A,He just said burn it.
3093,B,Okay
3094,A,He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that.
3095,A,So it's not very practical
3096,B,No.
3097,B,Well it's interesting.
3098,B,"I bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then."
3099,A,"Yeah,"
3100,A,"well, real interesting."
3101,B,Did it change anything for you?
3102,A,"Uh, not too much."
3103,A,"Uh, I got a bit."
3104,A,"Actually,"
3105,A,"So, uh, you know, my feeling is that, uh, it's really being used today,"
3106,A,"it, it, you know, it, it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal."
3107,B,"Right,"
3108,B,"I think I've seen some statistics that say that, uh, it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life."
3109,A,Right
3110,A,"because you, you've got all, all the prison expenses, plus all the legal expenses."
3111,B,Right.
3112,A,"Uh, and, you know, it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent. Uh, for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly don't think the people that are committing the crimes that would be eligible, you know, really care."
3113,B,"Well, that's,"
3114,B,"committing them mostly is, you know, either crimes of passion or at the moment"
3115,B,or they think they're not going to get caught
3116,B,"or,"
3117,A,"Right,"
3118,A,"I mean, it's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon, you know,"
3119,A,"I'm invulnerable,"
3120,A,I don't need to care about this.
3121,A,"You know, I, I, I'm never going to get caught."
3122,B,"Yeah,"
3123,B,"Yeah,"
3124,B,"but you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis, for example, someone like, uh, Jeffrey Dahlmer,"
3125,B,"do you want,"
3126,B,"by putting him in prison for life, there is still a possibility that he will get out again."
3127,A,"Yeah,"
3128,A,"one, one way or another."
3129,B,"Whereas if you kill him, there is not that possibility."
3130,A,"Yeah,"
3131,A,"but, but the other side to that is, if you put him in prison for life, there's a chance that he might do things in prison, or, you know, and somehow redeem himself."
3132,B,"Yeah,"
3133,B,"I don't think he could ever redeem himself,"
3134,B,"but in some cases, yes."
3135,A,"Well, You know, so that, you know,"
3136,A,"the, the question is, you know, the other problem with capital punishment you run into is, what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent, you know?"
3137,A,"There are cases where, you know, twenty, thirty years after the fact of getting evidence, especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence, then, oops,"
3138,A,"I'm sorry,"
3139,A,guess we killed the wrong guy.
3140,B,"Yeah,"
3141,B,"it's, it's,"
3142,B,"yeah,"
3143,B,"once you've made a decision that way, it's a little difficult to go back on it."
3144,A,"Right,"
3145,A,"you, you can apologize nicely,"
3146,A,"but, you know, you know, I think, you know, the, the price, you know,"
3147,A,"it, I've heard quotes, you know, it's better that a thousand people go free, than one person be unjustly imprisoned. I think is really the, the philosophy of the way our legal system works."
3148,B,"Oh, yeah,"
3149,B,"yeah,"
3150,B,it's
3151,B,"the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is, uh, based on the, uh, person who is accused."
3152,A,"Yeah,"
3153,A,"and, you know, the, I, I think that, you know,"
3154,A,"and the way it's being used now, it's like you listen to Bush is, you know,"
3155,A,"well, where are we going to impose you know,"
3156,A,"it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in,"
3157,A,"Tsongas is also saying, you know, capital, make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer."
3158,B,Right.
3159,A,"And, again, I don't thing these people care. *typo replace thing with think"
3160,A,They risk their lives every day.
3161,B,"Yeah,"
3162,B,"and, there, there, they seem that the profit uh, drug dealers, the profit margin's so high that, yeah the, the risk is almost not there."
3163,A,Yeah.
3164,A,"Yeah,"
3165,A,"and, and, you know, uh, especially, now, I live in, in Massachusetts, you know,"
3166,A,we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something.
3167,B,Yeah.
3168,A,"So, you know,"
3169,A,"but you look at our, our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to, to like Texas or someplace that does, you know, it, it, it's impossible to make a case that it's, it's affecting it in any way."
3170,B,Yeah.
3171,A,"I think it's mainly, people, like, they get the vengeance of it."
3172,B,"Yeah,"
3173,B,"well it's also,"
3174,A,"Because, you know,"
3175,B,I used to live in Georgia
3176,B,"and, you know, the, the big thing down there was, all right, we have capital punishment,"
3177,B,"but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed, it's very racially related and ethnically related,"
3178,A,"Oh, yeah"
3179,A,it's lot of blacks.
3180,A,Also a lot of young people.
3181,A,"You know, a, a, a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I've seen."
3182,B,Right.
3183,A,"And, you know, I, I think when you listen to like the, uh, the, the victims' families and things, they're always talking about, you know, uh, feeling justified or feeling, you know, like they've gotten something out of it,"
3184,A,"I mean, my thought has been, once the guy has been imprisoned, if he goes to jail forever or whatever, if he gets killed, it shouldn't make any difference to the, uh, the victim's family."
3185,A,"The only thing that should really, I mean,"
3186,A,"obviously, if someone of mine who has close died, I'd probably feel differently,"
3187,A,"but you know, you know, what, the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society."
3188,B,Right.
3189,B,Right
3190,B,"and that,"
3191,B,"and, you know, also by keeping them in prison, you do have the possibility, though, we don't currently do this, of making restitution."
3192,A,"Right,"
3193,A,"mean,"
3194,B,"You, you will work your prison job"
3195,B,and any money you earn will go to the victim's family.
3196,A,Right
3197,A,"and, the, the other thing is that, you know, I was reading through a book on, uh, geneo, human geneo research"
3198,B,Uh-huh.
3199,A,"and there, more and more things like schizophrenia"
3200,A,"and why, does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin."
3201,B,Right.
3202,A,"So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say, well, the problem is you, you've got an endorphin imbalance"
3203,A,"and, you know, if you take this regularly, you'll be a sane and productive member of society you know,"
3204,B,Uh-huh.
3205,A,"you really get back to the question of, you know, is someone responsible for their actions."
3206,B,"Yeah,"
3207,B,"well, I, I think on some of it, you have to say someone's responsible for his actions."
3208,B,"I never like the, uh, the defense, Well, I never liked the, uh, insanity defense."
3209,A,Society made me do it.
3210,A,Yeah.
3211,A,"Well, anyway I, uh, I, uh, oh,"
3212,A,yeah.
3213,A,I did forget to ask you.
3214,A,What is your name by the way?
3215,B,"Uh, I'm Ann."
3216,A,"Oh, you're Ann."
3217,A,Hi.
3218,A,"But, uh, anyway, I, uh,"
3219,A,"lot of, lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good, be a good change if we're going to be talking about the subject tonight which in some I guess criminal courts the"
3220,B,Criminal courts?
3221,B,Yes.
3222,A,Yeah.
3223,A,"the one of which was, uh, something, something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town"
3224,A,"and that is, uh, and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race. Uh,"
3225,B,"Oh, really?"
3226,A,Yeah.
3227,A,"Well, they, they, uh, the, the people that"
3228,A,"the, uh, the jury that's trying, uh, the officers in that case,  is, is an all white panel."
3229,B,Uh-huh.
3230,A,"And there's been a lot made in the local papers of that,  fact."
3231,B,I see.
3232,B,"I can't,"
3233,B,I'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one.
3234,A,They have.
3235,A,They have.
3236,A,They moved it up to the county north of here.
3237,B,Oh.
3238,A,"Um, it's in Ventura"
3239,A,"and there's, there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously,"
3240,A,"and it's kind of, it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that, uh, that,"
3241,B,"Well, that videotape was just horrible."
3242,A,Yeah.
3243,A,It was everywhere.
3244,B,Yes.
3245,A,"So you know,"
3246,A,"and I, I think it would be very difficult to find someone, uh, find a panel that would be, not have seen it and, and known of what was going on."
3247,B,"Oh, I agree with you"
3248,B,"but I can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of, of discrimination or, or, you know, uh, appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff."
3249,A,Exactly.
3250,A,"You know, um, the you know,"
3251,A,"I, I'm kind of torn on this issue."
3252,A,"It's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not, he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways I think true."
3253,A,"But on the other hand, it's, it's also saying that white jurors are not going to, are not going to convict."
3254,B,Right.
3255,A,"Uh, you know, they're not going to do their job. Which is"
3256,A,"the whole, the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or, or, or, uh, let go based on whether,  or not the person, whether or not the evidence says,  that there's enough"
3257,B,Exactly.
3258,B,Based on fact.
3259,B,Right.
3260,B,How interesting.
3261,B,Oh.
3262,B,So what's the prevailing thought within the community?
3263,A,"Um,"
3264,B,"I mean you know, what the news media is going to make of it,"
3265,B,but what about the community?
3266,A,"They, well,"
3267,A,I guess it depends on who you talk to.
3268,A,"I haven't talked to, uh, I haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it"
3269,A,"but I, I rather imagine there's, there's some snickering about it. And a lot of the usually fatalistic, uh, here we go again folks,  kind of stuff."
3270,B,Uh-huh.
3271,B,"Oh, my goodness."
3272,B,That can't be good for Los Angeles either.
3273,A,"No,"
3274,A,no.
3275,A,"I, you know,"
3276,A,"on, on, on one hand you know, on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing,  these people beating the heck out of this guy. Um,"
3277,B,"Oh, exactly."
3278,B,Unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like Los Angeles.
3279,B,You're going to have it just about anywhere.
3280,A,Uh-huh.
3281,B,There. *listen
3282,A,"Well,"
3283,B,"But that's, that's interesting."
3284,A,Yeah. Um
3285,B,What about the judge who's hearing the case?
3286,B,Is he going to be impartial?
3287,B,"Is he going to, be a a good adjudicator?"
3288,A,"I don't know. You know,"
3289,A,"and, and again there's something else you know, there was a uh, something else along those lines."
3290,A,There was a girl out here named
3291,A,"I don't know if it's, it's got, it's got as much notoriety"
3292,A,"but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was, as it was with, uh, the Rodney King problem."
3293,A,"Um, a girl walked into a Korean owned store"
3294,A,"and, uh, they, she had a dispute, black girl."
3295,B,Uh-huh.
3296,A,"She, she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the, with the owner of the store."
3297,A,The owner of the store popped her.
3298,B,"Oh, really?"
3299,A,Yeah.
3300,A,"And, and, oh, of course, they,"
3301,A,"you know, the criminal case went up"
3302,A,"and, and the judge gave the woman who shot her, shot the girl a, uh, uh, practically a suspended sentence."
3303,A,"I mean it was it was just,"
3304,B,"Oh, my goodness."
3305,A,"she gave her no time in jail, you know, all of these things"
3306,A,"and then, oh, there's we have these, we have people wondering around with petitions trying to get the judge,"
3307,B,To get that judge recalled I would think.
3308,A,Yeah.
3309,A,Yeah.
3310,B,Huh.
3311,B,That's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences.
3312,A,Yeah.
3313,A,"It would make, it would make life easier."
3314,B,It would.
3315,A,Yeah.
3316,B,"Uh,"
3317,A,"But,"
3318,B,"you would know, the whole world would know what you were facing."
3319,B,"And then it's a matter of, of deciding,"
3320,A,Okay.
3321,A,"Uh, before a couple of years ago, I had a, a very narrow view of, of nursing homes"
3322,A,"and it was, uh, more like a funeral home."
3323,A,I always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home.
3324,A,"And, uh, then I had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler, Texas"
3325,A,and I went to one
3326,A,and it just had a very good activities director.
3327,A,Everyone was cheerful
3328,A,and now I don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore.
3329,A,"But I, I certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last resort."
3330,A,"Uh, I have a sister that is in nursing school"
3331,A,and she's real interested in geriatrics.
3332,B,"Well, that sounds good."
3333,A,Yeah.
3334,A,"So, uh, she, she's real interested in, uh, what Ann Richards has been doing."
3335,A,"She's, Ann Richards is really cracking down on, uh, the nursing homes"
3336,A,"and, I don't know, you wouldn't know anything about a Texas governor"
3337,B,I've heard the name
3338,B,and that's about all it goes.
3339,A,Okay.
3340,A,Ann Richards is our governor in Texas
3341,A,and she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes.
3342,A,"And, uh, my sister's real interested in that and, and getting into the, to that side of nursing."
3343,B,Yeah.
3344,B,"That's one problem with the, the nursing home environment."
3345,B,"It, the elderly, even out of the nursing home, are very open to abuse."
3346,A,Right.
3347,B,"Uh, you know, they don't always have their full wits about them."
3348,A,Uh-huh.
3349,B,They're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on.
3350,A,Uh-huh.
3351,B,And it can be pretty sad.
3352,B,"I've got a, had a grandmother who had a stroke."
3353,B,And she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died.
3354,A,Oh.
3355,B,"And, you know, it's the type of thing that she was living down in Florida."
3356,B,My families was up in Maryland
3357,A,Uh-huh.
3358,B,"and the other part of her family was up in, uh, New York state."
3359,A,Right.
3360,B,"And, you know, it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was, uh, you know, could not do very much for herself after the stroke."
3361,A,Right.
3362,B,"And, you know, the nursing home was the, you know, best facility to put her in. You know, besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work"
3363,A,Uh-huh.
3364,B,"and both my, uh, aunts and uncle work. Which means it's, you know, very difficult for"
3365,A,Right.
3366,B,you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time.
3367,A,Right.
3368,B,"And, you know, there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in the home. Which makes it, you know,"
3369,A,Right.
3370,B,it's a necessary evil I think.
3371,A,Uh-huh.
3372,A,It sure is.
3373,A,And some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive. Because  cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older.
3374,B,Yeah.
3375,B,Yeah.
3376,B,"And, you know, even there you have to watch out for, you know,"
3377,B,you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there
3378,B,"and, you know, the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes."
3379,A,"Oh, yeah."
3380,A,Right.
3381,A,My grandfather passed away several years ago.
3382,A,I was much younger.
3383,A,"But, uh, he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life"
3384,A,and someone visited him every day.
3385,A,My grandmother did.
3386,A,"But, uh, if she couldn't, someone visited him every day."
3387,A,It was in a very small town nursing home.
3388,B,Uh-huh.
3389,A,"And, uh, people didn't get paid much there at all."
3390,A,They didn't care about what went on.
3391,B,Yeah.
3392,A,"They would let a, let a patient get a lot of bed sores."
3393,B,Uh-huh.
3394,A,"And, uh, the, the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people."
3395,A,"And then, the nurses and doctors really didn't put any for, forth any loving care for them."
3396,B,"Either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford to put in the, uh, care that they need. Cause it's, you know,"
3397,A,Right.
3398,A,Right.
3399,B,"an elderly person can, you know,"
3400,B,it's like a newborn baby.
3401,B,"You need to have twenty-four hour care uh, answering all the needs cause they can't do much for themselves at certain points."
3402,A,Uh-huh.
3403,A,Right.
3404,A,Right.
3405,A,And nurses get so worn down.
3406,B,Uh-huh.
3407,B,"And, you know, there's a lot of, number of"
3408,B,"the elderly are very, you know, complaining because they remember the way that things used to be. And remember being able to do things for themselves which, you know, they no longer can."
3409,A,Right.
3410,A,"Oh, sure."
3411,A,And they feel  they feel pretty helpless.
3412,B,"And it, very, very hard for them to accept that."
3413,B,"We just, uh, moved my grandfather into, not a nursing home but, you know, a transitional type facility."
3414,A,"Is it, uh, like a retirement center?"
3415,B,More of a retirement home.
3416,B,He's got his own efficiency apartment.
3417,A,Uh-huh.
3418,B,And they provide one meal a day.
3419,A,Uh-huh.
3420,B,"And, you know, the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him."
3421,A,Uh-huh.
3422,B,"But they do have, you know, group activities going on."
3423,A,How's he handling that?
3424,B,"Uh, he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida."
3425,A,Uh-huh.
3426,B,"Uh, you know, to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland"
3427,B,"and it's, it's a bit of a shock to the system, weather-wise, if nothing else."
3428,A,Ooh.
3429,A,"Oh, sure."
3430,A,"There wasn't anything like that, that you could do in Florida?"
3431,B,Well there was stuff like that in Florida
3432,B,"but,"
3433,A,"Uh, so, uh, what are your benefits like at your job,"
3434,A,and how do you feel about them?
3435,B,"Uh, pretty good, actually."
3436,B,I work for Hewlett Packard
3437,B,"and they have, uh, a pretty good, uh, benefits package."
3438,B,"In fact, they're, they're kind of known, uh, for having good benefits."
3439,B,"The pay isn't fabulous,"
3440,B,although I saw a survey recently
3441,B,"and I'm actually making just about as much as, you know, I'm making actually over average, over the average for my career, my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me."
3442,A,"Oh, that's good."
3443,A,Uh-huh.
3444,A,What kind of a degree have you got?
3445,B,I've got a Bachelor's in electrical engineering
3446,B,"so,"
3447,A,Oh.
3448,B,"And I'm not, like, a hugely advanced degree or any that"
3449,A,Uh-huh.
3450,B,"Uh, anyway, the, our benefits are pretty good."
3451,B,"We've got stock purchase program and a,"
3452,B,"that, that's pretty generous, although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is, kind of a, a pain,"
3453,A,Uh-huh.
3454,B,"but, uh, there's a four O one K plan uh, for, uh, sheltering some taxable income."
3455,A,Uh-huh.
3456,A,Uh-huh.
3457,B,"Uh, there's,"
3458,A,How long have you been with them?
3459,B,I've been with them for seven years.
3460,A,Uh.
3461,B,Yeah.
3462,A,That's good.
3463,B,"And, the best thing, and a lot of the stuff, the best thing is like four years or five years, it's pretty soon, you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything,"
3464,A,Uh-huh.
3465,B,"so, uh, it's not"
3466,B,"but there's full, uh, there's several medical plans to choose from, uh, that cover pretty much everything."
3467,B,"I don't get sick that often,"
3468,B,"so I don't pay much of it,"
3469,B,"and I pay five dollars every time I visit the, the hospital that, you know, for a checkup or whatever."
3470,A,Uh-huh.
3471,A,Uh-huh.
3472,B,"Uh, they don't cover eyes though,"
3473,B,"and I, I have contact lenses,"
3474,B,so that's kind of a pain.
3475,A,Uh-huh.
3476,B,"But, you know, I  I can live,"
3477,A,"But, for all  practical purpose, you are almost a hundred percent covered."
3478,B,"Oh, yeah,"
3479,B,yeah.
3480,A,"So that you've got small, small things to gripe about."
3481,B,Right.
3482,A,Wow.
3483,B,"And,"
3484,A,"Well, that sounds like you must feel really good about it."
3485,B,"Yeah,"
3486,B,"yeah,"
3487,B,"and, and the dental plan is"
3488,B,"The dental plan, I pay absolutely nothing because, uh"
3489,A,Wow.
3490,B,"I, I guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that"
3491,A,Uh-huh.
3492,B,"but that's not the case,"
3493,A,Uh-huh.
3494,B,"so, I guess nothing."
3495,B,It's fabulous.
3496,A,Wow.
3497,B,"Uh, the,"
3498,B,what about you?
3499,A,"Well, I, uh, work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory."
3500,A,I also have a part time job at a law firm
3501,A,"and I get no benefits from them, to the part time work although, they pay better per hour than my, my sort of, quote, real job does."
3502,B,Uh-huh.
3503,A,"Uh, and benefits, through the government are, uh, really,"
3504,A,"uh, they just, uh, they're not the greatest."
3505,A,"Uh, I, before I, I, uh, uh, got my degree"
3506,A,"I'm, uh, a computer scientist"
3507,B,Uh-huh.
3508,A,"and before I got my degree, I had, uh, done paralegal work for law firms here in Washington"
3509,B,Uh-huh.
3510,A,"and, uh, at that time, I was in gravy city."
3511,A,"Uh, the law firms in this town are not, you know,"
3512,A,for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties
3513,B,Yeah.
3514,A,"and, uh, benefits were just amazing"
3515,B,Uh-huh.
3516,A,"and we had everything paid for,"
3517,A,"and, uh, anyway, with the government, it's not, uh, quite that nice a deal."
3518,A,"Uh, but it's, you know, it's, it's okay."
3519,A,"What we have to do is, we have to pay, uh, about twenty percent of our, uh, uh, our costs"
3520,A,"and it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing,"
3521,A,"and the plans that are available to us, uh, range from kind of mediocre to really sweet"
3522,A,"and, uh, so I, I think I'm actually involved in a relatively good plan at this point."
3523,A,"Uh, but, uh, it could be better,"
3524,A,"that's for sure,"
3525,A,"and, uh, but, you know there are other things that you get when you work for the government uh, in, in terms of, uh, more relaxed atmosphere."
3526,B,Yeah.
3527,A,"It's really nice to be, for me, anyway, to be able to work in, uh, a research atmosphere, uh, where I don't have to, uh, uh, you know, worry about, uh, academics or anything like that,"
3528,A,"and, so I'm, I'm really kind of happy about that end of, of things."
3529,A,"It's, uh,"
3530,B,"Yeah,"
3531,B,"one of the things with my company is that they've, uh, got a reputation for a lot of job security"
3532,B,"and, uh there's a lot of different things that they do, lot of different divisions even this area, in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do,"
3533,A,Uh-huh.
3534,B,"so there's,"
3535,B,"I, myself have moved around quite a bit within the company"
3536,A,Uh-huh.
3537,B,"and it's, and I, and I haven't had to move my residence to do that."
3538,B,"You know, I still live in San Jose"
3539,B,"and,"
3540,A,"Wow,"
3541,A,that's fabulous.
3542,B,Yeah
3543,B,"it,"
3544,A,"You see, now that's, that's interesting,"
3545,A,because I have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area.
3546,B,"Oh, yeah?"
3547,B,Yeah.
3548,A,"He, he lives in Andover"
3549,B,Uh-huh.
3550,A,"and, uh, the work that he,"
3551,A,"he's, uh, specifically an engineer and, and does work with, uh, the Hewlett Packard machines that do, uh, uh, sonographic imagining"
3552,B,"Right,"
3553,B,right.
3554,A,"and, uh, I've been over to see his complex over there"
3555,A,and it's amazing.
3556,B,Uh-huh.
3557,A,"It's, it's all ecologically designed"
3558,A,"and, and, uh, he seems really, really happy with the, the set up."
3559,B,"Yeah,"
3560,B,yeah.
3561,A,"And,"
3562,B,"In fact, I know a guy who works at Andover who used to work, who I used to work with out here"
3563,A,Uh-huh.
3564,B,"and he moved his family back east a few years ago to, to take that position."
3565,B,Kind of interesting.
3566,B,"Uh, anyhow,"
3567,A,"Steve, uh, with the election year and whatnot coming up, do you think we ought to cut taxes, raise them,"
3568,A,"or, or, or what do you think?"
3569,B,"Well, that's, that's a really hard question."
3570,B,"I do know that, uh, politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths."
3571,B,"Uh, I"
3572,B,"let's example, uh,"
3573,B,"our friend, the President, right now, says no new taxes,"
3574,B,"we should and especially, if anything, be cutting taxes now because of the recession"
3575,B,"and at the same time, the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases,"
3576,B,"so, uh, I know the politicians, uh, aren't, aren't straightforward."
3577,B,"Now, in terms of economics I'm not,"
3578,B,"it's hard, hard to call."
3579,B,It really is.
3580,A,Uh-huh.
3581,A,"See, I never thought really, it's, uh, I never really thought that, that the, the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little."
3582,A,"I, I always that the, the real question was is, are we getting a reasonable return on, on investment."
3583,A,"For instance, like Social Security tax or uh,"
3584,A,"I mean, that's, that's tax"
3585,A,we're paying money
3586,A,"and, and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire, the money will be there for us."
3587,B,Right.
3588,A,"So that's,"
3589,A,"yeah, you know,"
3590,A,"when I, when I see that money taken out of my paycheck each, each week, I, or each, every other week, I, I really think that money's history"
3591,A,"and you know, so as far as return investment, that's not, that's nothing"
3592,B,"Yes, uh,"
3593,A,and we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back.
3594,A,"Uh, someone was telling me that there is a, uh, uh, there's still an office in, uh, you know, staffed with, with people there and, in D C that are researching to find a cure for polio, which,"
3595,A,"I may be wrong,"
3596,A,"but I believe that the cure for polio is already founded,"
3597,A,"but, but supposedly once you have an office in D C, or, you know, and, and staff it with people, it's really tough to close it down"
3598,A,"and, and they just haven't yet."
3599,B,"Well, yeah,"
3600,B,"I'm not exactly sure, uh, about polio in particular."
3601,B,I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio
3602,A,Uh-huh.
3603,B,I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio.
3604,A,"Well, that might be the difference."
3605,A,I don't know.
3606,A,"Uh, the other thing that, uh, I remember seeing on T V lately is, uh, had to do with,"
3607,A,it's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically
3608,B,Right.
3609,A,"that, that for some reason, historical sites with, you know, the, the full federal money and everything seem to appear as, as almost as like political favors to, to very strong politicians."
3610,B,"Yeah,"
3611,B,"it's, it's, it's funny because, uh, it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where, uh, you know, Congress is able to attach all kinds of, uh, funny amendments for individual, uh, congressional districts to the, to the main budget proposals"
3612,A,Uh-huh.
3613,B,"and the poor President has, has to, uh, either accept or reject the whole thing."
3614,A,"So, it sounds like you, uh, you think that, that we'd be able to save some money by, uh passing the line item veto."
3615,B,Oh.
3616,B,"I, I think the line item veto is not, not, is not necessarily a bad thing, assuming that the, uh, the, the President, uh, uses it to get rid of, uh, this kind of waste."
3617,B,"On the other hand, uh, it, it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things. Uh, and just to get rid of the unimportant things."
3618,A,Yeah.
3619,B,"And whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment, there's always going to be a dispute as to, uh, where the where the boundary between waste and, and necessity is."
3620,A,Uh-huh.
3621,B,"So I'm not, I'm not sure that, that that will help solve our problems,"
3622,B,"but there definitely is, is a problem with,"
3623,B,"uh, I forgot,"
3624,B,"there's a political term for this stuff, pork barrel or something."
3625,A,Yeah.
3626,B,"Uh,"
3627,A,Pork barrel politics.
3628,B,Pork barrel politics.
3629,B,there has to be some way to do it.
3630,B,I know state governors usually have line item vetos
3631,B,"and, uh, I lived in Massachusetts for a while"
3632,B,"and, uh, when Dukakis vetoed certain things, there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular."
3633,A,"Yeah,"
3634,A,"but Massachusetts wasn't, when Dukakis was there, anyway, wasn't in that great shape financially."
3635,B,at least at the end.
3636,A,Uh-huh.
3637,A,"I mean, I don't know,"
3638,A,"I,"
3639,B,"Yeah,"
3640,B,"they were very good at first,"
3641,B,they were in very good financials at first
3642,B,"and, uh, that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well."
3643,B,"And then, of course, the bottom fell out."
3644,A,"It's, uh, I mean, it's, it's tough."
3645,A,"I mean, there's, there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations."
3646,A,I guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot
3647,A,"or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and, and whatnot."
3648,B,And spare the economy.
3649,B,"Yeah,"
3650,B,"it's really, it's a hard balance. It, it definitely is."
3651,B,"Even not for government, even just, say, for a small business."
3652,B,"Uh, I know some,"
3653,A,"Uh, well, I'm not sure how it is in Georgia,"
3654,A,"but in, in Pittsburgh the the crime rate really is not very high at the moment."
3655,A,"Is that, is that true for, for Atlanta?"
3656,B,Atlanta is kind of high.
3657,B,"Uh, it's, it's lower than it has been in the past."
3658,B,"Uh, I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off,"
3659,B,and usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher.
3660,A,"Yeah,"
3661,A,"I,"
3662,A,"that's probably not true only for Atlanta, but for just about anywhere."
3663,B,Yeah.
3664,B,"Uh, what kind of crime problem do you usually run into?"
3665,B,Any specifics
3666,A,"Well, uh, the least, what, from what's on the news, uh, there are very few, like actual robberies reported, uh, uh, of, of residences."
3667,A,"What's more likely to occur is, uh, robbery of, uh, you know, knocking over a, a small store or a car theft, you know, it, things of that nature."
3668,A,"Very few, uh, assaults,"
3669,A,"although on the college campuses, uh, there are, uh, cases of, you know, like people getting machine from a, from an automated teller and, you know, somebody trying to, to device a scam for, for, uh, getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners."
3670,B,Um.
3671,A,"But mostly petty things and, no, nothing, nothing really too big."
3672,B,"Right,"
3673,B,"well, I guess here we run into that sometime,"
3674,B,"but I guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins that type, not much home break ins."
3675,A,Right.
3676,B,"There are some, but not, not very high."
3677,B,"Uh, as far as tellers and things like that, it's not extremely high either."
3678,B,"There were one case where, uh, this one guy, uh, was taking women from the teller and, and, you know, making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time, raping them all,"
3679,A,Uh-huh.
3680,B,"so, so that's kind of like a double assault there."
3681,A,"Yeah,"
3682,A,"uh, a strange case that, uh, that happened, oh, it's about, about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine."
3683,B,Really?
3684,A,It was a free standing machine
3685,A,and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it.
3686,B,Uh-huh.
3687,B,"Oh, wow."
3688,A,"Now, there's a crime for you."
3689,B,"Yeah,"
3690,B,there's a crime.
3691,A,"Yeah,"
3692,A,"but, uh, I guess most of the things that happen around here are, are pretty, uh, innocuous."
3693,A,"Although, uh, from what I hear in the news,"
3694,A,"and, and I, I saw an episode of the T V show, COPS uh, one time that was in Pittsburgh,"
3695,B,Uh-huh.
3696,A,"and, uh, it, it, it did surprise me, because, you know, they were doing drug arrests and thing, and things like that,"
3697,A,"but I, I don't really think those things happen too often because, like I said, from what's reported in the news, at least, it's, it's not all that common."
3698,B,"Oh, okay."
3699,B,"I don't know,"
3700,B,"crime situations here, they,"
3701,B,"like I say, lot of, lot of cases is usually just apartments and, and break ins and things like that"
3702,B,"and a lot of it is due to drugs. Uh, drug related, you know, in, in most cases,"
3703,A,Yeah.
3704,B,"it's not like, uh, it's someone do steal a, a or television or V C R or something like that"
3705,B,"it is for drugs, you know, because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se, you know,"
3706,B,you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it
3707,A,Yeah.
3708,B,so you really not making a sizeable profit.
3709,B,"So it's not really lucrative to take chances like that, you know, even though it, it does exist."
3710,A,"You know, I, just to diverge a little bit, uh, I live in an apartment."
3711,A,Right now I'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh
3712,A,"and, uh, the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in"
3713,B,Right.
3714,A,"But, even so, it, I mean, it's, it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to, to like lock the doors when they go out you know, and things like that."
3715,B,Yeah.
3716,B,Uh-huh.
3717,A,"Uh, it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just, you know, sit out back, take a look at when people are here and when they're not just come in, you know,"
3718,B,Uh-huh.
3719,A,there's a T V and a V C R
3720,A,"and, they could, uh, they could get in pretty easy and, and especially, uh, since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open, you know, while they're upstairs playing music,"
3721,B,Uh-huh.
3722,A,it could still happen then.
3723,B,"Yeah,"
3724,B,"that's true,"
3725,B,"but you'd be surprised also how, much people watch you that even not, uh, participating in any type crime."
3726,B,"I guess there was one case,"
3727,B,"I was surprised, uh,"
3728,B,"so happened this person worked at the same place,"
3729,B,I work for Georgia Tech
3730,B,"and they work at the same place I did,"
3731,B,but I didn't know that they had been watching me
3732,B,"because I was getting ready to, to go in my car one morning"
3733,B,"and the first thing they said is, uh, you must don't have to be to work at eight, you know,"
3734,B,"like shock,"
3735,B,"I, uh, get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio."
3736,B,"Uh, that is one of my big sources for current events information."
3737,B,"Uh, I really like that coverage."
3738,B,"My wife, uh, on the other hand is home most of the day"
3739,B,and she watches a lot of the cable news network.
3740,B,"Have you seen, uh, have you, uh, ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED?"
3741,A,"No,"
3742,A,"we don't have the, uh, national public radio in, in my area."
3743,B,Uh-huh.
3744,A,"I can hear it at the, uh, uh, oh, the college town nearby when I'm in Stillwater, which is about an hour away,"
3745,A,but the F M signal doesn't reach this far.
3746,B,Uh-huh.
3747,A,"Uh, I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit."
3748,A,"It gives you a whole different perspective on the news, uh, when you hear it from, say, a European point of view, or from the country of origin."
3749,B,Uh-huh.
3750,A,"Uh, I agree with you, too, on the, uh, uh, the cable channel, C N N and HEADLINE NEWS."
3751,A,"Uh, I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper uh, which is why I rely on shortwave and, and then the cable, cable, C N N."
3752,B,Uh-huh.
3753,B,"I'm, uh, interested in the, in the shortwave aspect of it."
3754,B,"Uh, how do you find that the, the coverage from other places in the world uh, compares with the American coverage of,"
3755,B,"how do you think that, uh, the viewpoints differ?"
3756,A,"I think a lot of it is just, uh, the fact that in the U S you're so far removed, uh, in a lot of cases from, say, conflicts"
3757,A,"or, or it's not happening in your backyard"
3758,B,Uh-huh.
3759,A,"so it's, it's more of a, it's not as a personal, uh, the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than, than what's on shortwave."
3760,A,"It's, B B C is, uh, oh, I don't know the right word, is, is almost, uh,"
3761,A,they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it
3762,B,Uh-huh.
3763,A,"and it just,"
3764,A,they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions.
3765,B,"Do you think, then, that, uh, the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts?"
3766,A,"Uh, very much so,"
3767,A,"very much so,"
3768,A,"and I, I think a lot of it is, uh, especially T V news,"
3769,A,"they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to, uh, oh, to really decipher the news and to really explain it."
3770,A,"I mean, I, you know, I think it's important to interpret it,"
3771,A,"but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to, to do the interpreting."
3772,B,Uh-huh.
3773,B,"Which, uh, which approach do you find to be, uh, more useful, the, the interpretive approach or the straight reporting?"
3774,A,"Oh, I like the straight reporting."
3775,A,"Uh, and then I, I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it."
3776,A,"It's, it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it"
3777,B,Uh-huh.
3778,A,"uh, I always think it's humorous when, when the President gives the State of the Union and, uh, for thirty minutes"
3779,A,and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard.
3780,A,"And a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they, what they write into it."
3781,B,Uh-huh.
3782,A,"So I, overall, I think I would rather hear just straight reporting."
3783,B,"One of the things that I found interesting last year during the, uh, the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against, uh, Peter Arnett, who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting, uh, some of the things that were available."
3784,B,"Uh, there was a, there was, uh, a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely, uh, uh, hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory,"
3785,B,"and while he was being severely, uh, censored and could not make any judgment call on this, it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda,"
3786,B,"but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that, you know, this isn't a baby milk factory,"
3787,B,"how could he say it was, uh,"
3788,B,"I, I think that, that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having the, not just the facts, but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them."
3789,A,"Yeah,"
3790,A,"I, I think people are, people have that opinion."
3791,A,"They, they want to sit down in front of the TV and, uh, or at a, read a magazine or U S A TODAY and read in four paragraphs, uh, and, and find out"
3792,B,"So, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order"
3793,B,"and after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it."
3794,B,What do you think?
3795,B,Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there?
3796,A,"Well, actually, I don't think they're out of line."
3797,A,"Devil's advocate possibly,"
3798,A,"but it, you are trying to avoid paying taxes"
3799,A,"and whether or not you agree with that law, you're still circumventing it."
3800,A,"You are legal in, in your circumvention of that law."
3801,B,"What, what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though?"
3802,B,"I mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying, uh, income tax on something that you purchase mail order?"
3803,A,"Really, I, I, I don't think that's a valid argument."
3804,A,I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax.
3805,A,"Um, naturally some, some things you just can't find in your local K-Mart or, or, uh, Bryn Mawr stereo dealer."
3806,A,"Uh, but then why not pay, pay the sales tax"
3807,A,"Corporations have to,"
3808,A,"why should an individual just because it's, just because the state can't really find out about it, be able to avoid paying sales tax?"
3809,B,"Well, I mean, it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when I purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania."
3810,B,"It's because, I'm sorry, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
3811,A,Yes.
3812,B,"Uh, it's because I, I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area."
3813,B,So I go outside the area for that.
3814,B,"And I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, you know, the revenue stream went to another state."
3815,B,"I don't, I don't think that that's my responsibility as a, as a conscientious consumer."
3816,A,"I, I'll agree it, it's not your responsibility"
3817,A,"but, is it also legal, for you to do that?"
3818,A,"from what I understand from various net readings, it, the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years."
3819,A,"It is, it is a lost revenue stream right now"
3820,A,and states can use all the revenue they can get.
3821,A,"With some, with something like that, do your arguments still apply?"
3822,B,"Well, I think that if, if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then I don't argue with it."
3823,B,"Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, I bought this out of state."
3824,B,I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania.
3825,A,Which is exactly what businesses do at the present.
3826,B,Right.
3827,B,But the point is is that businesses do that.
3828,B,The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question.
3829,B,That's a cost of doing business.
3830,B,The burden  shouldn't be placed on the consumer.
3831,A,"And I, I  I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having, having to pay sales tax on it."
3832,B,Uh.
3833,A,"That's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works."
3834,A,"Usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay."
3835,A,"But the accounting department will, uh, suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay."
3836,A,"And there there are some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try to avoid that."
3837,B,"Uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a consumer and  then being responsible for the sales tax? Or purchasing."
3838,A,No.
3839,A,"Businesses, uh if purchasing things mail order,"
3840,A,"if, if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say Utah."
3841,A,"Um, I, I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax."
3842,A,My accounting department will at the end of the month.
3843,A,I think that I think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania.
3844,A,"And I know they work that way in, uh, say here in D C."
3845,B,Yeah.
3846,B,"See I'm unfamiliar with that because I don't, I never see that end of the business."
3847,A,Yeah.
3848,B,"So, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer."
3849,B,"Uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for policing themselves, then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided."
3850,A,That's true.
3851,A,"a a big hole does exist right now, uh, in that consumers can just say oh, I, I forgot that."
3852,A,"There, there is no well defined mechanism at all"
3853,A,"and, and that it is a a loss. I, I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism just to do just that in in order to gain the revenue that's being lost."
3854,A,"Uh, I mean, I, I don't know if I agree with that."
3855,A,"But it, but,"
3856,A,Kathy?
3857,B,Uh-huh.
3858,B,"Do you,"
3859,A,"So, what is your, uh, family,"
3860,A,what do you usually do as far as budgeting?
3861,B,We have a very detailed budget. Because my husband is a finance major.
3862,A,Uh-huh.
3863,B,"And we have, you know, we have money that we take out each month that we, uh, you know, for food and, and for, for gas and things like that."
3864,B,"And then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for, uh, other things."
3865,A,Uh-huh.
3866,B,Then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year
3867,B,"and we budget them into what we call our, our needs and wants list."
3868,A,Uh-huh.
3869,B,"And so, uh, the things that, like a vacation."
3870,B,We have a vacation fund.
3871,B,"We have a fund for the things we need. And then a, for the things that we want."
3872,A,Uh-huh.
3873,B,"And, uh, and we're continually putting into those, you know, each month how much we're going to need"
3874,B,and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item.
3875,A,Uh-huh.
3876,B,So we very rarely buy anything on credit.
3877,B,Everything we buy is paid for.
3878,A,Yeah.
3879,A,My husband is a finance major also
3880,A,"And, uh, we kind of have the same plan."
3881,A,"Uh, we have one credit card"
3882,A,"and every month we put, uh, you know, the same amount in for retirement."
3883,A,"Uh, and we budget, we're, our, our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby."
3884,A,"So we're, budgeting, uh, each month, uh, an allowance for his education starting now."
3885,B,Right.
3886,B,Right.
3887,A,So that's in our budget every month now.
3888,A,That's the newest addition.
3889,A,"But we too do the same thing as far as, uh,"
3890,A,we have a set amount
3891,A,"we take, oh, one big vacation a year and then maybe, you know, three small vacations."
3892,A,"So we, you know, an, exact amount that we spend on that each year."
3893,B,Right.
3894,A,"And,"
3895,B,"Uh, we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money. Uh  instead of just writing checks for things."
3896,A,Uh-huh.
3897,A,Uh-huh.
3898,B,If we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here.
3899,A,I see.
3900,B,"And we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays, that we want to put in for, uh, the vacation. That we put in for Christmas."
3901,A,Like you have a separate account for that then?
3902,B,"Well, a lot of that, uh, I don't know how safe it is."
3903,B,"I guess, uh, we keep it all in a safe here at the house."
3904,A,"Oh, I see."
3905,A,Uh-huh.
3906,B,And so it's actually pulled out.
3907,B,Then we keep our
3908,A,"Oh, I see."
3909,B,we have a savings account for the kids' education.
3910,B,That money goes into there.
3911,A,Uh-huh.
3912,B,"Each of our,"
3913,B,we have three children.
3914,B,So they each have their own account.
3915,A,I see.
3916,B,That money is put into each month.
3917,A,Uh-huh.
3918,A,"Does your husband deal in, uh, stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff?"
3919,A,does he invest in that and  for long-term?
3920,B,He does somewhat.
3921,B,Yeah.
3922,B,He does somewhat.
3923,A,Uh-huh.
3924,B,"Uh, we have an investment plan."
3925,B,Yeah.
3926,B,I guess he does.
3927,A,Uh-huh.
3928,B,"But, uh, we have really found,"
3929,B,this is the first year we've done it this way.
3930,B,And we are really saving a lot of money.
3931,A,Really.
3932,A,"Because you're, you've, you've sat down with a piece of paper and said well let's see what are we going to,"
3933,A,"so what goes into that, that particular thing?"
3934,A,"It's vacations, Christmas."
3935,B,"Christmas, birthdays, uh, car maintenance, dental, medical,"
3936,B,we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much  we used on dental
3937,A,Uh-huh.
3938,B,"and, uh, and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from,"
3939,A,Right.
3940,B,"we have it, you know."
3941,A,Uh-huh.
3942,B,"And when, when we see something on sale, uh, instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it, and then when something comes up, you know, kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill.  Everything's taken care of."
3943,A,Uh-huh.
3944,B,And we're finding that we even have more money than we thought.
3945,A,Really.
3946,B,Yeah
3947,A,"Well, you know, uh, what do you do as far as,"
3948,A,"I, I take it,"
3949,A,"do you, uh, run the family budget as far as, uh, groceries and that sort of thing?"
3950,B,I do.
3951,B,Uh-huh.
3952,B,All the money.
3953,A,Uh-huh.
3954,A,"And how, what's that?"
3955,B,All the money is turned over to me.
3956,A,Uh-huh.
3957,A,"Do you have a set amount that, that you spend each month"
3958,A,or  or how do you work that?
3959,B,Yes.
3960,B,I have a set amount.
3961,B,It's very generous
3962,B,and I usually have extra.
3963,A,Uh-huh.
3964,B,"And so then that can go, uh, you know, either back into our checking account"
3965,B,or I can just carry it over.
3966,A,Uh-huh.
3967,B,"Uh, you know, there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months. And  certain times when that will be left over."
3968,A,Uh-huh.
3969,B,But that's completely up to me how I do that.
3970,B,"And  then, uh, because I don't work. I stay home."
3971,A,Uh-huh.
3972,A,I do too.
3973,A,I stay home also.
3974,B,And so it's kind of my money
3975,B,"and I also get my own money to do what I want to. Go to lunches, you know, and do that kind of thing."
3976,A,Uh-huh.
3977,B,"We have a clothing, uh, envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing."
3978,A,Uh-huh.
3979,B,It really works out great.
3980,B,We're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that.
3981,B,"And we're,"
3982,A,Yeah.
3983,A,"What, what,"
3984,A,"as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a T V or a big item, like for the house."
3985,A,"How,"
3986,A,do you have like a household?
3987,B,Yes.
3988,B,We have a household budget.
3989,B,Like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year.
3990,A,Uh-huh.
3991,B,"And also, we need a new bed."
3992,B,And so we've got both of those budgeted
3993,B,and we put a certain amount in each month
3994,B,and we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those.
3995,A,Uh-huh.
3996,B,"And if we find one on sale before then, then we can just take that and put it towards"
3997,A,"Well, here in Logan, Utah, we've got a nice little valley here"
3998,A,and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in
3999,A,and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley.
4000,B,Huh.
4001,B,"Well, here in Seattle, uh, it's the air's getting more and more polluted."
4002,B,"We're, uh, we're in kind of a basin"
4003,B,"And, uh, Seattle is on Puget Sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains."
4004,B,"And, uh, there's been a lot, a lot of growth, population growth around here"
4005,B,"And, uh, it's, uh, it's getting worse"
4006,B,I think  most of it is from cars.
4007,A,Yeah.
4008,A,Yeah.
4009,A,Definitely.
4010,A,"Here in Utah up along the Wasatch along the western side of the, of these Rocky Mountains here, where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo"
4011,A,"and Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north,"
4012,A,we get a lot of pollution
4013,A,and it's like seventy percent of it is from cars.
4014,B,Uh-huh
4015,A,"And, uh, it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion"
4016,A,"And when we get, get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above"
4017,A,and it just sits and sits and sits
4018,A,and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of L A a few years ago.
4019,B,Oh.
4020,A,"It's not, it's almost sad."
4021,A,"Because when I grew up here, it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys"
4022,A,and now it's not in the mountain valleys.
4023,B,Yeah.
4024,B,"Yeah,"
4025,B,"I live in the, university district"
4026,B,"and, uh, uh, it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution"
4027,B,"I think probably due to, uh, a lot of students going back and forth to school."
4028,A,Huh.
4029,B,And then we're right next to Interstate Five also.
4030,A,"They're getting serious about things like, uh, mandatory,"
4031,A,"well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties,"
4032,A,emissions.
4033,B,"Oh, yeah."
4034,B,have they started doing that yet?
4035,A,Yeah.
4036,A,"They've actually started doing it down along the,"
4037,A,not in Logan up here cause we're doing a lot better.
4038,A,"We have a lot, population is a lot lighter up here."
4039,B,We have that here
4040,B,"and, uh, they're, they're expanding it to, uh, more counties here. Uh, as the population spreads out"
4041,B,"and I think they're also going to be making it, uh, mandatory for more cars."
4042,B,"there was, uh, something in the law about if your car was over a certain age, like over twenty years old, you didn't have to get it done anymore."
4043,B,"And  I think they're eliminating that, uh  that loophole."
4044,A,Yeah.
4045,A,Yeah.
4046,A,They're eliminating that out here.
4047,B,Yeah.
4048,A,"They're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun. Where they're, uh, looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the, basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust."
4049,A,Kind of like a radar gun.
4050,A,And ...
4051,B,"Oh, really,"
4052,B,You mean they could  do that remotely?
4053,A,Yes.
4054,A,Yeah.
4055,A,"Do it remotely just looking at the, what they do,"
4056,A,they do several different types of things.
4057,A,Sometimes they put a source light
4058,A,and they look at the source light
4059,A,"and then as the car goes by, you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it"
4060,A,and you can look at the emissions actually.
4061,B,Huh.
4062,A,And ...
4063,B,Now where does the source light go?
4064,A,Like across the street.
4065,A,They'll set up  like a trap or something like that in some sense.
4066,B,"Oh, I see."
4067,A,"And they're also looking at, uh, other, you know, ways of monitoring this and, cause they've found out something basically that, uh,"
4068,A,"and a poorly tuned car can emit something,"
4069,A,it's an incredible amount.
4070,A,"It was like four hundred times as much uh, of certain pollutants, and it was like unburned hydrocarbons, then a properly tuned car."
4071,B,Jeez.
4072,A,"And, and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars, well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the, the pollution then, you know, you, it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half."
4073,B,Yeah.
4074,B,That's neat
4075,B,"But it's also been, uh, oh, you know,"
4076,B,everybody is talking about using more mass transient here
4077,B,"but it, uh, it's tough, you know."
4078,B,"Like I've, I've looked into riding the bus to work"
4079,B,"and I can drive to work in, uh, and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor. Which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges."
4080,A,Uh-huh.
4081,B,"But if I, uh, if I take the bus, it requires several transfers"
4082,B,and it takes over an hour.
4083,A,Huh.
4084,B,"So so it  it's, it's not hard to see why, why I keep driving."
4085,A,Yeah.
4086,A,And they're ...
4087,B,"And you know, I feel guilty cause I'm driving a"
4088,A,Hi
4089,B,Hi.
4090,A,"Uh, uh I, I should say something."
4091,B,Uh-huh.
4092,A,"That I'm the, uh, least informed,"
4093,A,this is totally accidental that I have to talk about this topic.
4094,A,"But, it's, I'm the least informed person in the whole United States."
4095,A,This has not been determined yet
4096,A,"but I, I, I've never read a newspaper in my entire life"
4097,A,"and I've, I, I never watch T V news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off."
4098,A,"But,"
4099,B,Any particular reason?
4100,A,"Well, no."
4101,A,"I, I've, I've explored that with lots of people."
4102,A,"Uh, they've tried to lock me up and, uh, things like that."
4103,A,"But, uh, uh, I'm basically not interested"
4104,A,"and I also find the, uh, everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and and off the, uh, uh,"
4105,A,"what am I trying to say. Uh,"
4106,A,I do learn about things. Largely from friends
4107,B,Uh-huh.
4108,B,Huh
4109,A,and I occasionally will read something like the NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS.
4110,A,"You know, someone will write a book about something"
4111,A,and then I'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier.
4112,B,Uh-huh.
4113,A,"But it,"
4114,A,"and somehow,"
4115,A,"and anything I participated in or know about when I read about it in the paper is always so, uh, covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that I don't have much confidence in it."
4116,A,"But, I mean, I don't think it's just that I'm lazy"
4117,B,"I really don't,"
4118,B,"I like to refer to this as sort of CONSUMER REPORT phenomenon. Which is everybody that I know reads CONSUMER REPORTS so the people who do feel that CONSUMER REPORTS does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest. But, assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas. Uh, without thinking that there were people in, who think each other areas, area of, of specialty"
4119,A,Uh-huh.
4120,A,Uh-huh.
4121,A,Uh-huh.
4122,B,"and, uh, I guess you could explain it two ways."
4123,B,"And, and the cynical view is, well these things aren't doing a very good job at all."
4124,B,"And the view that I would rather take is that there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or, uh, particularly interested in buying something as a, you know  as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things."
4125,A,Uh-huh.
4126,A,Right.
4127,A,Yeah.
4128,B,And I think the same thing is true with news.
4129,B,"If you want to just have an idea as to what's going on, most papers, and especially the better papers, the, the TIMES, the WALL STREET JOURNAL, the WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea."
4130,A,Uh-huh.
4131,A,Yeah.
4132,B,"If you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know  that much."
4133,A,Right.
4134,A,"Doesn't want,"
4135,A,"Let me ask, by the way, just for the record."
4136,A,"I, I'm, I totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them."
4137,A,"So, I mean, I'm not being elitist in that sense, I hope. Uh,"
4138,B,"Well, I mean, there's, there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things"
4139,A,Yeah.
4140,A,"What,"
4141,B,And most people think it is
4142,B,"and I can, I can, you know, accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it."
4143,A,Yeah.
4144,A,"By the way when you say most people think it is,"
4145,A,"I think it's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine think it is, percent."
4146,B,I don't think it's that high.
4147,A,"Oh, you don't?"
4148,B,I know a lot of people who may watch the T V news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper.
4149,A,Right.
4150,B,"And I think they're saying well if something's really important, I'll at least find out that it happened."
4151,A,Yeah.
4152,B,"And, and that's a, that's, is a reasonable start"
4153,B,and for awhile I didn't read a newspaper when I came out here because I didn't find one that I liked.
4154,B,"Uh, and if something important happened, it was covered on T V"
4155,B,"and I could then go and, and pick up newspapers if, if it were important enough to read about."
4156,A,Uh-huh.
4157,B,"And I imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened, you'd find out from friends or other channels"
4158,A,Yeah.
4159,A,"Uh, I did, on the, uh, the Supreme Court hearings, the, for, uh, uh, the whole business of, uh,"
4160,A,"see I actually have a, a,"
4161,B,"Clarence Thomas or,"
4162,A,"Yeah,"
4163,A,the Thomas and Anita Hill business.
4164,B,Right.
4165,A,"I, I mean that's, that's the closest thing."
4166,A,I deeply cared about that.
4167,B,Uh-huh.
4168,A,"Uh, and I sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine"
4169,A,"and when I arrived at her house, she was engrossed in that."
4170,A,We ended up watching it for a couple of hours. Zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and watching it some more.
4171,A,And I thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on.
4172,A,"But even then, I didn't end up doing it on my own. Uh, uh,"
4173,B,Yeah.
4174,B,I stayed as far away from those as I could.
4175,A,Uh-huh.
4176,B,I decided I didn't want to waste the time
4177,B,"I had, I guess, five years ago now, wasted that kind of time with Oliver North hearings. And afterwards, decided that what I had gotten out of it just wasn't worth the time I put in. And that these things are just very slow in seeing information come out."
4178,A,"Right,"
4179,A,right.
4180,A,Yeah.
4181,A,Uh-huh.
4182,A,Yeah.
4183,A,"Do you ever read,"
4184,A,what sort of company do you work for?
4185,A,Do you work for a big or a little place?
4186,B,"Uh, I work for Georgia Tech."
4187,B,Yes sir.
4188,B,I work for the research facility.
4189,B,"Uh, and it's, it's kind of small in a sense"
4190,B,"but it, it does have, about, uh, I guess, two thousand civil employees."
4191,A,Uh-huh.
4192,B,"And, on a, a scale, I guess it's still considered small."
4193,B,It just have a lot of different laboratories.
4194,A,Uh-huh.
4195,B,"The area I work in, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so."
4196,A,Uh-huh.
4197,B,So that's make up most of the laboratory
4198,B,"so from, from that standpoint, it's pretty small it's pretty small."
4199,A,Uh-huh.
4200,B,What about yourself?
4201,A,Huh.
4202,A,"Well, I, I work for, uh, actually probably similar kind of place."
4203,A,"I work for, uh, Lincoln Laboratory."
4204,B,"Oh, okay."
4205,A,"Uh, yeah."
4206,A,We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech.
4207,B,"Oh, okay."
4208,B,I see.
4209,A,"Uh, and, uh,"
4210,A,"so we're, we're part, we're actually part of M I T."
4211,A,"So it's very much the same kind of place and, uh  the technical institution."
4212,B,"Oh, okay."
4213,B,"Right. Uh,"
4214,A,"Uh, while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what, uh, uh, what things were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. I guess, uh, list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh the working conditions, things like that."
4215,B,Uh-huh.
4216,B,Right.
4217,A,I don't know.
4218,A,"What are your, uh, what sorts of things would you consider important?"
4219,B,Well those and probably the security aspect of it.
4220,A,Uh-huh.
4221,B,"Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, uh, you're treated,"
4222,B,and it may not be true in every place.
4223,B,"In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a, a person."
4224,A,Uh-huh.
4225,B,"Because when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people and, and, you know, their well being as far as, you know, how they going, their next dollar going to come in."
4226,B,How they going to pay their bills.
4227,B,They just lay them off.
4228,A,Yeah.
4229,B,"And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had, uh,"
4230,B,I think the company still exists.
4231,B,"What they use to do is, they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off you know."
4232,A,Uh-huh.
4233,B,"That way that, you know, one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time."
4234,A,Uh-huh.
4235,B,"And, uh, you know, I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, you know, other than you know, something like,"
4236,B,unemployment is good
4237,B,but I mean the company as a whole
4238,B,"because you as an employee, even the company is making money,"
4239,B,they paying you a salary
4240,B,but you are responsible for that company growth.
4241,B,You're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it's at at making profits.
4242,B,"So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that."
4243,A,Uh-huh.
4244,B,"You know. Because it's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know."
4245,B,"I don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of a company situation."
4246,A,Now how do you mean that?
4247,A,"I know it,"
4248,B,"Well in a sense that say, how do you make a, a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people. Uh, for the bad times of the company."
4249,A,Uh-huh.
4250,B,"What about the, the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well."
4251,A,Uh-huh.
4252,B,You know. In that standpoint.
4253,A,"Well, you, you think it's better than to, to try to spread the, the effort equally among all the employees of the company"
4254,A,"or,"
4255,B,"yes,"
4256,B,I do.
4257,A,Uh-huh.
4258,B,I really do.
4259,B,I think it'd be better that way
4260,B,"and even at that, it would at least give the person time to look for another job because  they know that that there are problems"
4261,A,Uh-huh.
4262,B,"and, you know, there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time."
4263,A,Yeah.
4264,A,Uh-huh.
4265,B,"You know. That's just, that's my views, you know."
4266,A,Yeah.
4267,A,I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that.
4268,A,"I think, uh, back about, a few years ago when things were tough, Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile."
4269,A,"They went to a, uh, a, a four and a half day work week rather  than cut, yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent. And, uh, have to, give everybody a half day a week off."
4270,B,Right.
4271,B,Right.
4272,B,Right.
4273,A,And I think you can do that for a little while
4274,A,"but I'm,"
4275,B,"Well at least that would give a person a chance to look you know. Because the way it is, a person really don't have a chance"
4276,A,Yeah.
4277,A,"All right, have you lived in this area long?"
4278,B,"No,"
4279,B,I've only been here a couple of years.
4280,A,Okay.
4281,B,"Uh, but, uh, I've, I've noticed that, uh, this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past."
4282,A,"Yeah,"
4283,A,"it, it, it's, it's a lot warmer, a lot drier too, because usually about this time of year, this, you know, you see a little bit more rain."
4284,A,"I mean by, by mid February, I mean, we start getting a lot of rain."
4285,B,"Yeah,"
4286,B,"yeah,"
4287,B,"well I remember last year, or the year before, uh, we had ice and snow, uh, uh,"
4288,A,"But it,"
4289,B,"terrible ice storm, uh, around this time of the year."
4290,A,Uh-huh.
4291,B,"And, uh, this year it's been so hot and, uh, sunny"
4292,B,"it, it's really quite, uh, quite amazing."
4293,A,"Yeah,"
4294,A,unseasonable.
4295,A,"I used to, my wife and I we used to live in San Antonio, couple years ago,"
4296,B,Uh-huh.
4297,A,"and it was, it was I remember the first day of Spring,"
4298,A,"it was so much ice that came down, later on that that afternoon and evening,"
4299,B,"Um. Yes,"
4300,A,"it was just, it was horrible."
4301,B,"I was just talking to my son today,"
4302,B,"he's up in Boston,"
4303,B,and it was twenty-nine there
4304,B,"and it was, you know, in the seventies out here"
4305,B,"and, it was really, uh,"
4306,A,Yeah.
4307,B,"he really wished he could be here, rather than there."
4308,A,"Yeah,"
4309,A,"well, um, I don't know"
4310,A,"I, I guess I'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather."
4311,B,Oh really.
4312,A,"Um, I, I like it warmer,"
4313,A,"I mean I like it, you know, I like it warm"
4314,A,but it doesn't really matter.
4315,A,"I mean, I'd, I would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly"
4316,A,"but, uh,"
4317,B,"Uh-huh,"
4318,B,uh-huh.
4319,B,"I have, you know,"
4320,B,"I, I,"
4321,B,I think it's really been delightful.
4322,B,"I come, uh, I've spent most of my time in, in warm weather areas"
4323,B,"and, uh, uh, the ice and snow just doesn't, uh, hold any allure for me at all."
4324,A,"Well I spent three years in Germany,"
4325,A,so I'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway
4326,A,"But I got used to it,"
4327,A,"it was really strange,"
4328,A,"I mean, when I, when, when, when we came to San Antonio it was just like, uh, you know, it just, just swelter"
4329,A,and then we got used to it
4330,A,and then we went up to Dallas
4331,A,"and it was just,"
4332,A,"it's, it's not, not that it's just hot or dry,"
4333,A,"it's just not very comfortable,"
4334,A,"it just,"
4335,B,"do you, you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas."
4336,A,"Yeah,"
4337,A,a little bit.
4338,B,Uh-huh.
4339,A,Yeah.
4340,B,"You must, well, uh,"
4341,B,"it must be quite a bit hotter down there, isn't it?"
4342,A,"Yeah,"
4343,A,"my wife and I, the last day we were in Florida, we, my visiting my, uh, my parents, and my brother and sister,"
4344,A,"we were, we were down there"
4345,A,"and, the last day, right before we left, we had to, I had to ride with my sister"
4346,A,and the air conditioning went out on the car
4347,B,"Oh, wow."
4348,A,"and, we, you, you just get used to air conditioning all the time,"
4349,B,Oh yes.
4350,A,"and this,"
4351,A,"it was just,"
4352,A,"the humidity was like eighty plus, eighty percent plus"
4353,A,and it was just killing us.
4354,B,"Oh yeah,"
4355,B,it's terrible.
4356,B,Orlando is the only place I've ever been where I've seen the car sweat.
4357,A,Yeah.
4358,B,"I mean, that's really bad."
4359,A,"Yeah,"
4360,A,"well, I mean, I, I, I guess I've been in some places, you know, where the weather was just so mild, you know, places like Monterey, California or, you know,"
4361,B,"Uh-huh,"
4362,B,uh-huh.
4363,A,"just, you know, so mild,"
4364,A,"and then you've been to such extremes like San Angelo, Texas where you just, where you walk outside and you sweat,"
4365,A,"you know you're sweating,"
4366,B,Yeah.
4367,A,"you look down at your arm,"
4368,A,"but you see the water leaving your arm,"
4369,A,"it's so hot, you just feel it pulling away, bizarre."
4370,B,"Oh wow, uh."
4371,B,"I know I, I tend to, I tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate."
4372,A,Yeah.
4373,B,"Uh it doesn't,"
4374,B,"some people say, uh, they, they like to watch the changing of the seasons"
4375,B,"but, uh, I'd rather, you know, like southern California, you know, have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time."
4376,A,Yeah.
4377,B,"So, it's kind of a luxury."
4378,A,I tend to agree
4379,A,"but, I don't know,"
4380,A,"I, I think, in, in some, in some respects it probably more tolerable."
4381,B,"Yeah,"
4382,B,"well I guess this, the weather isn't as lively a topic as, uh, as some of the others we might have gotten."
4383,A,"No,"
4384,A,the other topics.
4385,A,"I got one topic,"
4386,A,"they said talk about the Middle East well,"
4387,B,"I guess we're supposed to say good-bye or something, and think about what"
4388,B,my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye.
4389,B,"We messed up the conversation, anyway."
4390,A,"Well I mean I've had some pretty bad, I guess some pretty controversial topics"
4391,A,so it's just like well that was my fault.
4392,A,"But then the weather's like,"
4393,A,"man, I mean, it gets pretty mundane,"
4394,A,"I mean you can only talk about, about the situation just so long."
4395,B,"Yeah,"
4396,B,"I know,"
4397,B,weather's just not all that inspiring.
4398,B,"Okay,"
4399,B,well it's nice talking to you.
4400,A,Okay.
4401,B,Bye-bye.
4402,A,Bye.
4403,B,"pretty good,"
4404,B,pretty good.
4405,B,"So we're talking about drug testing in the work place, huh. *listen"
4406,A,Drug testing in the work place.
4407,A,"Um. I've been tested a few times, just before drug employment."
4408,A,But that's about it.
4409,A,I've never had random drug testing.
4410,B,"Yeah,"
4411,B,"we have random drug testing at, in my business,"
4412,B,"but I've never been, uh, never had to do it."
4413,A,"Oh, really?"
4414,B,"Yeah,"
4415,B,"yeah,"
4416,B,"they started that about a year ago,"
4417,B,"and I think it's mostly for the, the field people that, you know, drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff."
4418,A,Uh-huh.
4419,B,"But, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,"
4420,B,at least that's.
4421,A,"Oh, they do with alcohol."
4422,B,Pardon?
4423,A,They do it with alcohol?
4424,B,"Yeah,"
4425,B,"yeah,"
4426,B,"they, they, they'll check for alcohol."
4427,A,"Oh, I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine."
4428,B,"No,"
4429,B,"once, once you start doing that stuff, you sort of, you're sort of stuck into, uh, checking for the whole, the whole thing."
4430,A,Huh. That's interesting.
4431,B,"Yeah,"
4432,B,"it's a,"
4433,A,What type of field of work are you in?
4434,B,I'm in the oil business.
4435,A,"Oh, in the oil business."
4436,B,Yeah.
4437,A,"Okay,"
4438,A,and you work in the office around.
4439,B,"Yeah,"
4440,B,"I work in the office,"
4441,B,"so, uh, it's pretty, pretty safe environment."
4442,A,Uh-huh.
4443,A,Yeah
4444,A,"see, I work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make the safety bags for the cars,"
4445,B,"Uh-huh,"
4446,B,uh-huh.
4447,A,and we work around a lot of explosives.
4448,B,"Well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, uh, straight on."
4449,A,"Yeah,"
4450,A,"so that's, you know,"
4451,A,"I'm all for it, because the, well, the type of environment I work in, you know, they're working with explosives,"
4452,A,"and so they could blow up the whole,"
4453,A,"well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use,"
4454,A,"but still, it can be dangerous."
4455,B,"Yeah,"
4456,B,"yeah,"
4457,B,"well, I, I, I agree."
4458,B,"I think that, uh, you know, under certain circumstances, especially when you're working in, in high risk, uh, uh, industries, where you can really hurt other people, that, that you need to have that kind of stuff."
4459,A,Yeah.
4460,B,"You know,"
4461,B,"if it's,"
4462,B,"as long as it's not abused, uh, you know, random, you know,"
4463,B,"as long as it's random, and, and the individual's rights are, uh, are protected, I don't have that big a problem with it."
4464,A,"Now do they fire them, or do they?"
4465,B,"Well, see, this is it,"
4466,B,this is where I start having my problems with my company.
4467,B,"I work for a private company,"
4468,B,"and and the policy is something like, see if I can state this correctly now. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem, then you're eligible for company counseling."
4469,A,Uh-huh.
4470,A,Uh-huh.
4471,B,"But if they catch you, if you test positive for a, a controlled substance, then you get fired."
4472,A,"Oh, wow."
4473,B,"So, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos."
4474,A,"Huh, that's."
4475,A,"I think our policy is that,"
4476,A,"all right, it's probably the same thing."
4477,A,I'm not really sure what the
4478,B,"Yeah,"
4479,B,"really,"
4480,B,"it's one of those things that you read once,"
4481,B,"and then, if you, if you're not worried about it, you just forget about it"
4482,A,That's right.
4483,A,"But I know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance,"
4484,A,but I'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in.
4485,B,Yeah.
4486,B,"Yeah,"
4487,B,"yeah,"
4488,B,our company's a little tougher on the second chance.
4489,B,"I mean, if, if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in, then they ought to, you know, go out of the way, I think, a little bit more to, uh, to help you get, help get you rehabilitated to, you know, to get get back at your job."
4490,A,Uh-huh.
4491,B,"But, uh, when you're not, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply."
4492,A,"Uh, do you think it works very good with that random, do you think it limits,"
4493,B,"Well, it's, it's hard for me to, to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment"
4494,B,"and, you know, it's not,"
4495,B,"I guess I haven't run into anybody that's, that's had a problem that's, that's been a problem."
4496,A,Uh-huh.
4497,B,"Uh, so I you know, I guess it works, uh, much like, uh, well, shoot, like any lottery,"
4498,B,"I mean, everybody's got an equal chance to get picked."
4499,A,Uh-huh.
4500,B,"So, uh, I'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the A and B are going to be in"
4501,B,"and next week, C and D are going to come in"
4502,A,You could time it just right.
4503,B,"Yeah,"
4504,B,"right,"
4505,B,right.
4506,A,"I know one employee,"
4507,A,"I know, when I was working with, he had alcohol on his breath,"
4508,A,and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.
4509,A,That'd be just as dangerous.
4510,B,Yeah.
4511,B,"Well, especially around, uh, you know, equipment, machinery and stuff."
4512,A,Huh. That's true.
4513,B,"You know, I've, I've gone out and had a, had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case"
4514,A,Uh-huh.
4515,A,"Do they give any limits on alcohol,"
4516,A,or is it?
4517,B,"Uh, I don't remember, to tell you the truth."
4518,B,I don't think they do.
4519,B,"Um, well, they must,"
4520,B,"I mean, gee whiz."
4521,B,"That just shows you how much I've been paying attention,"
4522,B,"because I, I really don't know."
4523,B,I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask
4524,A,Oh.
4525,B,"Well, you know, you can take some of that, that testing a little bit too far."
4526,B,"Uh, there was a company in Houston that,"
4527,B,"they did, uh, an unannounced drug sweep of the, of their company"
4528,A,Uh-huh.
4529,B,"oh, it was, it was, it was an unannounced sweep of, of,"
4530,B,"it was not only drugs,"
4531,A,Okay Karen.
4532,A,you're first.
4533,B,Okay.
4534,B,"I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement. You know, not to get in, like in a dead end job."
4535,A,Uh-huh.
4536,B,"And plus, for me, it's, uh, I mean like medical and you know, uh, benefits and dental."
4537,A,Okay.
4538,B,They're also important.
4539,A,Yeah.
4540,A,"I guess one of the differences I see is, uh, working for a university, uh, there is room for advancement, but not so much so, our in, uh, quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association"
4541,B,Um.
4542,A,"so there is a progressive path,"
4543,A,"but not being in the say the commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people uh, like really,"
4544,B,Um.
4545,B,Are they like pretty much train for a specific job
4546,B,"and that what I hired for and then I, just very little variation from that."
4547,A,"Yeah,"
4548,A,"somewhat that,"
4549,A,"but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have, uh, a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances."
4550,B,Uh-huh.
4551,A,"Uh, so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution,"
4552,A,"uh, it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance"
4553,B,Uh-huh.
4554,A,"and I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution, perhaps somewhat even with the business, uh."
4555,A,"But I agree, you know, the, uh, medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the, uh, security aspect for long term employment, uh,"
4556,B,"Well, you know that's interesting though."
4557,B,Because I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore.
4558,B,"I use to think that, you know, after you work,"
4559,B,"you mean security, job security?"
4560,A,"Job security,"
4561,A,yes.
4562,B,"Uh, that use to be I think a couple of years ago,"
4563,B,but I don't know if it is so much anymore.
4564,B,"In fact, they, we just had a lay off in what November, I guess."
4565,A,Uh-huh.
4566,B,"But, uh, it wasn't necessarily,"
4567,B,"I mean, you know, some people had been there a long time."
4568,A,"Yeah,"
4569,A,we are seeing that here as well.
4570,A,Like in some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs.
4571,B,Uh-huh.
4572,A,"Uh, so I, I think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in, uh, institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses, we need to cut back, that's what we do."
4573,B,Uh-huh.
4574,B,Uh-huh.
4575,B,No doubt
4576,A,"But,"
4577,B,yeah.
4578,A,"Yeah,"
4579,A,"and institutionally, like here at the university, oh if there is a cut back, well gee, it's not where it necessarily where it's needed,"
4580,A,"it's where it's most expedient which, Well, in one sense for us, it's where it makes the least noise which means it's  often the lowest support type roles."
4581,B,"Expedient,"
4582,B,yeah
4583,B,that's exactly it.
4584,B,"Yeah,"
4585,B,"where the most dollar, where, where you know it cuts back the most."
4586,B,Oh.
4587,B,Oh.
4588,B,"See, yeah."
4589,A,"So we,"
4590,B,Yeah.
4591,B,I think that's one of the things too.
4592,B,"You get too many management people, you know."
4593,A,It's very easy.
4594,B,Yeah
4595,B,"and it's very easy for them to say, oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know."
4596,A,Yeah.
4597,B,And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time.
4598,B,"Well, those people aren't there anymore."
4599,A,Right.
4600,A,Because it's support people that are providing  the speed for it.
4601,B,Yeah.
4602,B,Uh-huh.
4603,B,"Yeah,"
4604,B,"but,"
4605,B,so what else do you think is important?
4606,A,"Well the, uh,"
4607,A,"that's maybe the majority of the importance, I guess."
4608,A,"Yeah,"
4609,A,"because my perspective is from an institution,"
4610,A,"uh, the, there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe"
4611,B,Uh-huh.
4612,B,Uh-huh.
4613,A,"but if you're in the corporate world, I think there is considerable motivation for I guess innovation,"
4614,A,"although he, you know, the more complex your structure the, uh, less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through"
4615,B,Uh-huh.
4616,A,"but, uh, I think there is, uh, it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's, uh, things can happen much more quickly"
4617,A,and so you can see the reward of the efforts.
4618,B,"I think probably in a small,"
4619,B,"yeah,"
4620,B,"I was going to say more, it's more personal for one thing."
4621,B,"You probably have a better team, uh, cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere."
4622,A,Right.
4623,B,"Probably, where as in a bigger corporation, I think you're just a number, you know."
4624,A,Yeah.
4625,A,You end up being your own person
4626,B,Uh-huh.
4627,A,"and, uh, if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up, well then that's their problem"
4628,A,"and you know you really,"
4629,B,Uh-huh.
4630,B,"whereas yeah in a smaller,"
4631,B,"I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished, you know."
4632,A,Yeah.
4633,A,Yeah.
4634,A,It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves.
4635,B,Uh-huh.
4636,B,Hi.
4637,A,Okay.
4638,A,"So, uh, with the issue of trial by jury, uh, I actually found the whole question about whether you need a, a a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting."
4639,B,"Yeah,"
4640,B,"actually, I, I agree that that's an interesting thing."
4641,B,"I, I believe that's a, for, for civil suits it's not unanimous, right,"
4642,B,"but for, for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law?"
4643,A,"I don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because I thought there were cases where, uh, I don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors, but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve."
4644,B,"Yeah,"
4645,B,"I actually thought I'd read that, too"
4646,B,and that's why I phrased it that way.
4647,A,Yeah.
4648,B,"I wonder,"
4649,B,"the difference, yeah, the difference could be that for, uh, state, if there is such a thing, state felonies versus federal felonies that federal, things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote,"
4650,B,"and things that are under state jurisdiction, even criminal don't require,"
4651,B,"but I don't know what the, the laws,"
4652,B,"do you think that that's an unreasonable, uh, requirement that they be unanimous?"
4653,A,"Well, I'd be curious as to what the, uh, requirement for a, an acquittal is."
4654,A,"And I, I don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal."
4655,A,"But I don't know whether you need an, a unanimous, uh, vote of not guilty to acquit."
4656,B,"Yeah,"
4657,B,"that, that would be an interesting change."
4658,B,"It was also allow the, uh, idea that if you had one person who was, uh, very disagreeable that, I mean, it, it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because, uh, the fact that it's the, the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt, uh, criterion that it, uh, increases the, the likelihood of getting the proper judgment."
4659,B,"So, I, I think, if anything, it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision."
4660,A,"Yeah,"
4661,A,I'd agree with that.
4662,A,"But I've never had the, the opportunity to serve on a jury, although I've been out here and registered for, I guess, about five years."
4663,B,"Yeah,"
4664,B,"actually I, I thought that that would be very interesting thing to do."
4665,A,"But,"
4666,B,I would like to do that.
4667,B,I've been out here twenty some years
4668,B,"and I've been called, uh, three different times,"
4669,B,"but I've never actually even made it into the, the jury box. And, because there have always been a number of people"
4670,A,Oh.
4671,B,"and, and I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions."
4672,B,"Uh, I,"
4673,B,"yeah,"
4674,B,I also think that would be really good.
4675,B,"I,"
4676,A,"the people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is a, you know, something like a nine, three or, or more severe and, and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right"
4677,B,Uh-huh.
4678,A,"and in fact, I'm not sure that that's any more, uh, liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than, than anything else."
4679,B,"Well, the, the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this, is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three, or some such number, that there's, an effect starts being that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure going on"
4680,A,Uh-huh.
4681,B,"and that that, uh, peer pressure,"
4682,B,"and in some cases if it's a long trial, the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time, that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons."
4683,A,"Yeah,"
4684,A,"I'd read one book, I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things, that, uh went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases, and in many cases looking at what had, at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right, went back to the jurors, uh, based on the deliberations."
4685,B,"Uh,"
4686,B,Uh-huh.
4687,A,"Some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict, uh, you know, everyone was getting on them so, so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict."
4688,B,"Yeah,"
4689,B,"I, I understand."
4690,B,"You, you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude, uh, to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response."
4691,B,"I think of the movie, uh, TWELVE ANGRY MEN."
4692,A,Uh-huh.
4693,B,You ever seen that movie?
4694,A,"Yeah,"
4695,A,once.
4696,B,"Uh, yeah,"
4697,B,"it's, it's, it's exactly that situation where, uh,"
4698,B,it's Henry Fonda
4699,B,and it's eleven to one
4700,B,"and he's the one,"
4701,B,"I, I believe he was opposed to the conviction"
4702,B,"and, uh, and he held on"
4703,B,"and,"
4704,A,Hi.
4705,A,"So, do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have?"
4706,B,"Uh, actually no,"
4707,B,"because, because I'm in school."
4708,B,"I, I kind of miss out on most of the current events."
4709,B,I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it.
4710,A,Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then?
4711,B,"Uh, I don't watch a lot of it,"
4712,B,but that's the
4713,B,basically that's my only major source of information.
4714,A,Um.
4715,B,"What about, what about you?"
4716,A,"Well, I read, uh,"
4717,A,I get a bunch of different things.
4718,A,I get a newspaper every day
4719,A,"and I try to at, at least have a few minutes to look through that"
4720,A,"and I look through, uh,"
4721,A,"I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I, I pretty much read that cover to cover"
4722,A,"and I, as far as, you know,"
4723,A,that satisfies most of the short term news I get.
4724,A,"Uh, don't watch much T V,"
4725,A,don't have enough time
4726,A,"and, uh, don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that, you know,"
4727,A,they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened
4728,B,Yeah.
4729,A,and that's about all I ever hear of it.
4730,A,"Uh, but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK"
4731,A,"and for the longer term I, I read, uh, like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and, and, uh, READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which, they,"
4732,A,"the news isn't, like, immediate what you'd generally think of as news,"
4733,A,but it's recent material.
4734,B,And it's more in depth.
4735,A,"Yeah,"
4736,A,"it is, it is more in depth, less broad."
4737,A,"Well, actually, it's, probably isn't less broad,"
4738,A,but it's just more in depth
4739,A,"and, uh, it is, it is more it is more just significant information, you know."
4740,A,"It is the big events, not the little events."
4741,B,Yeah.
4742,A,"Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main, you know."
4743,B,"I know,"
4744,B,where they're just trying to fill in.
4745,A,"Yes,"
4746,A,"or they're making, making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news."
4747,B,Yeah.
4748,A,"Uh, I get kind of bored watching T V actually, when I watch the news on T V because it goes so slow"
4749,B,"I know,"
4750,B,"I do, I do, too."
4751,A,"and, then there's nothing that, you know, really is like oh, so exciting."
4752,B,"Yeah,"
4753,B,"you may find one little, uh, news item interesting"
4754,B,"so you have to wait twenty minutes to, to hear about it."
4755,A,"Yeah,"
4756,A,"that, that's about what it ends up being."
4757,A,Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something
4758,B,"Yeah,"
4759,B,"actually, you mention NEWSWEEK,"
4760,B,"I, I, I do like, uh, U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT."
4761,B,"I don't get to read it as much as I like,"
4762,B,"but that's, I think that's a good magazine."
4763,A,"Yeah,"
4764,A,I think they're about the same.
4765,A,"I, you know, they, they certainly have a very similar, uh, charter at least in my mind."
4766,A,"And, uh, uh, what, what kind of, uh, what kind of news normally interests you,"
4767,A,"I mean what do you, what, what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring?"
4768,B,"Well right now trying to keep abreast of, uh, what's going on in Europe, you know, with all the, U S S R's satellites breaking off, trying to become independent and, you know, European community coming together."
4769,A,Uh-huh.
4770,B,"That's going to affect our, uh, economy quite a bit."
4771,A,"I think it will,"
4772,A,"uh, they, they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence,"
4773,A,but we've yet to see it
4774,A,and
4775,A,"it's real short term yet, though,"
4776,A,"I mean, it's only been, three months or something like that since that happened"
4777,B,"Oh, yeah."
4778,A,"so,"
4779,B,Yeah.
4780,A,But they like to tell us that it's going to be important
4781,B,"I'm, I'm pretty sure it is, because, uh once, once Europe becomes unified and, uh, their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be, uh, kind of hurting"
4782,A,"I think it is, too."
4783,A,"Yeah,"
4784,A,"I, I think that's a possibility,"
4785,A,"uh, it, we might also be helped, though, because it, it will be easier to do business over there, too."
4786,B,"Yeah,"
4787,B,definitely.
4788,A,For the companies that already have a presence over there
4789,A,"and, uh, I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it came time."
4790,B,"Oh, yeah"
4791,B,"so they have a toe hold,"
4792,B,I good toe hold.
4793,A,Yep.
4794,A,"Because once you're in there, then you can easily expand."
4795,A,But getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult.
4796,B,"Yeah,"
4797,B,"because, when they first start off, they're going to be highly protectionist"
4798,B,"so,"
4799,A,Yes.
4800,B,Yeah.
4801,A,"And there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist,"
4802,A,"even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist, you know."
4803,B,Yeah.
4804,A,"Like, England doesn't want to do one thing"
4805,A,"and, and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing"
4806,A,"and they're, they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet."
4807,B,Uh-huh.
4808,A,"And some of it, I mean, is,"
4809,A,"I'm sure within those people's minds, it's quite justified."
4810,B,"Yeah,"
4811,B,"I, I can understand their viewpoint,"
4812,B,"they're just, they're starting off,"
4813,B,"their economy's a little bit weak,"
4814,B,so you want to get established before they
4815,A,Uh-huh.
4816,A,Before they open up their borders to everyone.
4817,B,"Yeah,"
4818,B,totally.
4819,A,"Uh, what is the, uh,"
4820,A,do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that?
4821,B,Actually I'm not really into sports.
4822,B,"My roommates are,"
4823,B,"so, unfortunately, I forced to watch quite a bit of sports."
4824,A,Against your will.
4825,B,"Yeah,"
4826,B,"we have to, fight over the remote control."
4827,A,"Yeah,"
4828,A,at least you guys have a remote control.
4829,A,It's sometimes better to not have one of those.
4830,A,"Course, you can always mislocate it. Or misplace it, I mean, not mislocate it, but misplace it"
4831,A,"and,"
4832,A,"So, what kind of music you into?"
4833,B,"Well, I have a, uh, pretty wide taste, uh, in music, ranging from progressive rock to jazz to, uh, lot of different forms of, uh, music."
4834,B,"In fact, it's easier for me to say, uh, the types of music that I don't like are opera and, uh, screaming heavy metal."
4835,A,"The opera, yeah, it's right on track."
4836,A,"I like classical,"
4837,A,but I can't deal with opera at all.
4838,A,"And heavy metal, uh, it's noisy."
4839,A,"I'm into, uh, some industrial music that's, a, a bit even harder than that."
4840,B,Uh-huh.
4841,A,"But it's, it's got to have a point to it."
4842,B,"Oh, I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to,"
4843,B,"but, uh, the, the, uh, basic point of heavy metal which seems to be music to annoy you, is, uh, gets a little annoying."
4844,A,Yeah.
4845,A,What kind of progressive stuff?
4846,B,"Uh, lot of stuff that actually has, uh, ended up becoming popular like, uh, Nirvana and, uh, oh, you know,"
4847,B,"I'm thirty,"
4848,B,"so lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and, and the Sex Pistols and R E M, that sort of stuff."
4849,A,uh.
4850,B,"Uh, R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being, uh, you know, ultra mainstream at this point,"
4851,B,and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed.
4852,A,"Oh, yeah."
4853,A,"Yeah,"
4854,A,"it's, a lot of people like, saying that, you know, bands in that position, you know, sold out."
4855,B,Uh-huh.
4856,A,"I think that's pretty much, you know, bull."
4857,A,Because R E M really hasn't changed.
4858,A,"If, it's, it's interesting."
4859,A,"They're producing, uh, similar music"
4860,A,and it's good music
4861,B,Uh-huh.
4862,A,"but, you know, people have picked up on it."
4863,A,That's good.
4864,B,I think it is.
4865,A,I'm impressed.
4866,B,"Uh, for a while there, music seemed to really popular music seemed to have, uh, not a lot of point to it."
4867,B,"I was really tired of, uh, the Michael Bolton."
4868,B,"Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he, he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes."
4869,A,"Oh, yeah."
4870,B,"And I could, uh, go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money."
4871,A,"Uh, but he picked the right songs"
4872,A,"and and that that's about all he had going for him. Or still has, for that matter."
4873,B,I guess.
4874,B,"That, and a marvelous hairdo."
4875,A,"Oh, yeah."
4876,A,"Yeah,"
4877,A,"I'm sure that, that that sold a lot for him."
4878,A,"That's all you really need for a lot of, lot of pop."
4879,A,"I'm I've kind of like developed a, a short hatred for, for pop."
4880,A,"It just seems like there's no, no real point."
4881,A,"You hear the same, same tune over and over again in a thousand guises"
4882,B,Uh-huh.
4883,A,"and,"
4884,B,"Well, it's interesting because you were, you were saying that you liked classical music"
4885,A,Uh-huh.
4886,B,"and I like a lot of classical music,"
4887,B,"but I also dislike, uh, some classical music,"
4888,B,"and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music, and feel that if, if it's not seventy five years old, it hasn't stood the test of time."
4889,A,"Yeah,"
4890,A,"I can, I can believe that."
4891,A,"What kind of things are you, do you like in classical?"
4892,A,What's the standard?
4893,B,"Uh,"
4894,B,"Stuff that I like,"
4895,B,"uh, I like Bach."
4896,B,I tolerate Vivaldi.
4897,B,"I can't, stand, uh, uh, Debussy or Debussy different"
4898,B,"Uh, uh, I like Tchaikovsky."
4899,B,"He can make a lot of noise when he's, uh, so inclined."
4900,A,"Oh, yes."
4901,B,"Uh, and some of, some stuff that I like, uh,"
4902,B,"for instance, Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition"
4903,A,Uh-huh.
4904,B,"and that's interesting music,"
4905,B,"but it would not get performed by any, uh, municipally funded, uh, philharmonic, uh, just because, number one, it's Frank Zappa and he's weird, number two, isn't he still alive."
4906,B,"You know, we're, we're, much better off playing, uh, Beethoven's ninth,"
4907,B,"that's right, you know,"
4908,B,"we'll do, we'll do the ninth"
4909,B,and everyone will know it and and hum it
4910,A,It's safe.
4911,B,"and it, it just isn't chance taking enough for me."
4912,B,"Uh, I feel that, uh, that, that music should take chances in one way or another and that, uh, you know, if you've heard a piece, oh, a hundred, a hundred times,"
4913,A,"Do you think that there's any way that, uh,"
4914,A,or do you think there's too much crime now?
4915,A,"I mean, I guess, any crime is too much"
4916,A,"but, It's out of control."
4917,B,"Uh, yeah,"
4918,B,yeah.
4919,B,"Uh, well, uh, out of control, I don't know."
4920,B,I guess it could be worse.
4921,B,"Uh, we've, uh, we've, we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood."
4922,B,"Uh, I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington."
4923,B,"Uh, there's, uh, there's a lot of problems."
4924,B,"I mean, there's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people"
4925,B,"and, uh, you know, we get cars on our block, uh, regularly, uh, uh, uh, gone through, rifled through and stuff."
4926,A,Really?
4927,B,Yeah.
4928,A,"I would not of, okay, I would not have guessed that in Seattle."
4929,B,"Yeah,"
4930,B,"you figured it was like Omaha, right?"
4931,A,Yeah.
4932,A,You know.
4933,B,"No,"
4934,B,"it's, uh, it's not Newark,"
4935,B,"but, uh, yeah"
4936,B,it's got problems.
4937,A,"Yeah,"
4938,A,"I wonder, I mean, I wonder what, what really is the answer."
4939,A,"I mean, it seems like our, our, the prison systems, we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system."
4940,B,"Yeah,"
4941,B,"I think most people regard it as a warehouse. Where you put away the people that are so bad that, uh, you don't want them out in circulation."
4942,A,Yeah.
4943,A,"But, but the problem is, is that we, we only have but so much room"
4944,A,"and we, we try to put aside in the warehouse,"
4945,A,and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes
4946,B,Yeah.
4947,A,"and,"
4948,B,That's what I hear.
4949,A,"So it's, uh,"
4950,B,"Yeah,"
4951,B,"I, I think, you know,"
4952,B,don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea?
4953,A,I get the feeling that a lot of people have.
4954,A,I'm not convinced that I have.
4955,B,Yeah.
4956,A,"Uh, see, I mean, my mom taught English as a second language"
4957,A,"and, and she was dealing mostly with people that were, were in on drug crimes"
4958,A,"and, uh,"
4959,B,"Oh, you mean she taught in a prison?"
4960,A,Yes.
4961,B,Oh.
4962,A,In a in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia.
4963,B,I see.
4964,B,uh.
4965,A,"And, the problem she had was not with the inmates at all."
4966,A,"The, the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison."
4967,A,"I mean, It was, it was, I mean,"
4968,B,"Yeah,"
4969,B,the the bureaucracy.
4970,A,"they, they put her, I mean,"
4971,A,"I didn't, obviously I didn't see the classroom, uh, and, hopefully never will,"
4972,A,"but, uh they, they put her at the end of a hallway,"
4973,A,there were no other classes going on at the time
4974,A,"and they refused to let her wear a body a body alarm. Which,"
4975,B,Uh.
4976,A,and
4977,A,"I don't know exactly what that is,"
4978,A,"but I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and, and really annoy a lot of people."
4979,B,Yeah.
4980,A,"But, uh, you know"
4981,B,So she didn't feel safe.
4982,A,"No,"
4983,A,she didn't.
4984,A,"She didn't,"
4985,A,"she, she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates,"
4986,A,"and then later on the, uh, the administration kept getting worse,"
4987,A,"and, uh, she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't, she didn't feel quite as comfortable around."
4988,B,Yeah.
4989,A,"But, well, she had decided that it was, when we came back to the States, she decided that it was too,"
4990,A,"she didn't feel that public schools were were safe,"
4991,A,so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison.
4992,B,"Yeah,"
4993,B,right.
4994,A,"But, uh,"
4995,B,"Well, at least it's maximum security, right"
4996,A,Yeah.
4997,A,"But, but the point that was, that it, you know,"
4998,A,"you said that perhaps, uh, people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible"
4999,A,"and, and I'm, I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in, that run the system have given up on it."
5000,B,"Uh, well, I, I think the people that run, yeah, that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical, you know."
5001,A,Uh.
5002,B,"I mean, I, uh, you know, I, I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff"
5003,B,"and it's, uh,"
5004,B,"you can get pretty hardened, I'm sure."
5005,A,"But getting, I mean, well, see,"
5006,A,"I always have problems because, because I can never decide whether or not I'm, I'm supposed to be a conservative or, or a liberal"
5007,A,"but,"
5008,B,"Yeah,"
5009,B,right.
5010,A,"But I keep, I keep thinking that there's got to be some way, that, that a lot of this is circumstances."
5011,B,Those are funny see
5012,A,"I mean, I can't help but wonder if, if I grew up without a father, on the streets, and with like little or no money, wouldn't wouldn't I be in prison this"
5013,B,"Oh, yeah."
5014,B,"Oh, Oh, yeah,"
5015,B,absolutely.
5016,B,"I think, uh, yeah, I think you can blame it on social problems."
5017,B,Sure.
5018,A,"I mean, I don't know."
5019,B,"I mean, as, as, you know, as poverty has gotten worse, as, you know, education has gotten worse, as there's been more single parent families, as there's been more homelessness, there's been more crime."
5020,A,We've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't  get onto the program.
5021,B,"Yeah,"
5022,B,"there's not enough  beds and treatment programs, rising drug abuse,"
5023,B,"and, yep,"
5024,B,it's a mess.
5025,A,"I don't, I don't remember the, the gentleman's name,"
5026,A,"but the, the, uh, the mayor of Baltimore is a, is a Rhodes Scholar"
5027,A,"and what he,"
5028,B,"Is he the guy wants to, like, deregulate heroin, or something?"
5029,A,"Well, what he wants to do is take all the money that, uh, he gets for drug enforcement and use it for, uh, drug education."
5030,B,Uh-huh.
5031,A,"And basically, just, just attack the problem at the demand side."
5032,B,Uh-huh.
5033,A,"Stop trying to attack supply because, which, which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't."
5034,A,"I mean, Switzerland tried the, the grand experiment"
5035,A,"and, you know, they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park"
5036,A,"and,"
5037,A,"Yeah,"
5038,A,"Jonathan, uh, you you say it's near and dear to your heart."
5039,A,"Buying a car is, uh, something you're contemplating, I take it."
5040,B,"Uh, fantasizing about."
5041,A,Uh.
5042,B,Can't do it right now.
5043,B,Our situation is that we're a two car family
5044,A,Uh-huh.
5045,B,and I have a mini van we bought a few years ago.
5046,A,Uh
5047,B,"It's got a, uh, five year loan,"
5048,B,so that's still got a couple years to run
5049,A,Uh-huh.
5050,B,"and the car I get to drive is a, uh, Nissan Sentra that's going to be ten years old next month"
5051,B,"so, I think about, uh, sprucing that up in a couple years if I can."
5052,A,Uh-huh.
5053,A,"What do you think you'll, uh, what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next?"
5054,B,"Well since I just turned forty, I'm thinking about a forty year old man's car, something, uh, something real sporty"
5055,A,Uh-huh.
5056,B,"but, uh, realistically with, uh, the need to take the kids to school, probably have to have something that, uh, wouldn't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat. *spelling wined should be wind"
5057,A,Uh-huh.
5058,B,a seating room.
5059,B,How about you?
5060,A,"Well, I think the next car we get will probably be a well"
5061,A,"I, I like Buicks."
5062,A,"We have a Buick Century now,"
5063,A,it's a nineteen eighty-seven
5064,B,Uh-huh.
5065,A,"and, uh, whatever I get, I want to have, uh, air bags, uh, both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to, you know, rather than have them stoop down to get over,"
5066,A,so I think the four door is probably a major requirement
5067,B,Sure.
5068,A,"and, other than that, uh, you know, reasonable cost and safety and, uh, as much economy as you can get out of a car."
5069,A,"Uh, you know, I'm not looking for one with a great big engine, uh"
5070,B,Sure.
5071,A,"something that will carry it around careful, I guess is best, best way to describe it."
5072,A,"Right now, we've got a V six"
5073,A,"and it, that seems to be just fine."
5074,A,I know they they're coming out with some V eight now
5075,A,and I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age.
5076,B,"Yeah,"
5077,B,"I was surprised to hear that the V eights are coming back,"
5078,B,"so, they've got some pretty powerful sixes."
5079,A,Uh-huh.
5080,B,"And, uh, you know, V eights seem to be a return to the days of, you know, ten or twelve miles a gallon."
5081,A,Right.
5082,A,"I, uh, I drive a, a truck, a Ford truck."
5083,A,"I, I like trucks because they're spacious,"
5084,A,and it's handy to haul things.
5085,A,"Uh, it's not related to my business,"
5086,A,"I just really use it, basically, for transportation,"
5087,A,"but there's so many occasions when I've had to move some members of the family or do this or that,"
5088,A,and it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one.
5089,B,Sure.
5090,B,"Is, uh, traction much of an issue for you up there."
5091,A,Traction?
5092,A,"Uh, not really, uh, you know,"
5093,A,it's a two wheel drive truck
5094,A,"and I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive, I probably ought to be home anyway"
5095,B,"Actually, uh, pretty good way of looking at it,"
5096,B,yeah.
5097,B,"We, uh, we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago."
5098,A,Wow.
5099,B,"A case where there was a, sort of freak ice storm"
5100,B,"and we weren't aware of it, and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car,"
5101,B,"and, this is a rear wheel drive model."
5102,B,"So, we got some monster studded snow tires after that."
5103,A,Uh-huh.
5104,B,Haven't had any problems since.
5105,A,"What kind of, what make is the mini van?"
5106,B,It's a Mazda.
5107,A,"Mazda,"
5108,A,I see.
5109,B,"And, uh, we're pleased with it in terms of comfort, and, uh, driveability."
5110,B,"Fuel economy isn't great, being a mini van,"
5111,B,"but, uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others"
5112,B,"and it's, uh, got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around"
5113,A,Right.
5114,B,"so we've been able to do some real creative, uh, load hauling when called upon."
5115,A,"One of my sons has a, a Plymouth, uh, van or, you know, uh, uh, that same type of thing, the Voyager, I guess"
5116,B,Uh-huh.
5117,B,Right.
5118,A,"and, uh, they have a, a child that's five years old"
5119,A,"and it's really handy for hauling him around and, and their stuff,"
5120,A,"and, of course, as he gets friends, I'm sure that will be even handier."
5121,A,"So, I know if we were, if we had kids still at home, we're in our fifties now, but, if we had kids still at home, we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value."
5122,B,"Yeah,"
5123,B,"I think that we're going to be, uh, owning a mini van for some years to come."
5124,B,"Probably till the kids are out of, uh, high school anyway."
5125,A,"What about, uh, all wheel drive?"
5126,A,Is that something that you'd be interested in
5127,A,"or is that,"
5128,B,"Uh I'd be satisfied with a, a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra."
5129,A,Uh-huh.
5130,B,"And even as, as light as that is with, uh, the small tires it's, it's done pretty well in winter,"
5131,A,Uh-huh.
5132,B,"uh, again, like you, if conditions are, are that bad, I probably don't want to be driving anyway."
5133,A,Right.
5134,B,"So I know I'd be happy with a, a reasonable, uh, four door."
5135,B,"You know, again, we've, we've got the same issue with getting kids into the,"
5136,A,"What kind of crime do you think, uh, is the most prevalent in our society?"
5137,B,"Oh, boy, probably, uh, robberies, people stealing from each other."
5138,A,Such as New York City
5139,B,Is that what happens up there a lot?
5140,B,"Uh, that, that's mostly what I hear, is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen."
5141,B,"That's the most prevalent crime. Uh, the ones that really, you know, the ones that really add up after a while, I guess, you know, from, far as insurance money and stuff like that, insurance costs."
5142,B,"You know, everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually."
5143,A,"Yeah,"
5144,A,"I, I, I wonder if, uh, if drug use is a more prevalent crime, though, because, I mean, so many people use it,"
5145,A,"and even though just using is not really,"
5146,A,"I mean it is a crime,"
5147,B,"Oh, well, yeah,"
5148,B,"that, that, that is a crime."
5149,B,"I guess, uh, when you, when you count all the little things that people do like,"
5150,B,"uh, speeding is a crime"
5151,A,"Well, that's true."
5152,B,I break that law every day
5153,A,"But I was, I, I was staying in the realm of, of felonies versus misdemeanors and, uh, drug use,"
5154,B,Uh-huh.
5155,A,"well, actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor,"
5156,A,"but, uh, what kind, what kind,"
5157,A,"have you been, uh, have you been the subject of such a crime, such as stealing, or anything?"
5158,B,"Well, I've, uh, I've been caught with marijuana before,"
5159,B,so I guess that was a crime.
5160,B,"I got a year's probation for that,"
5161,B,"but, uh,"
5162,A,"That, that's not that much."
5163,A,"I mean  you know, those aren't,"
5164,B,"No,"
5165,B,it wasn't that  big a deal.
5166,A,"I,"
5167,B,"Uh, when I think of crime, I think of stuff that, that affects other people like people getting, you know, killed or raped."
5168,B,I think rape is one of the worst crimes
5169,A,"Yeah,"
5170,A,I think it is.
5171,A,"I, in some ways, it's almost worse than murder."
5172,B,"Yeah,"
5173,B,it's very degrading
5174,A,"Uh,"
5175,A,"Murder, murder is, is hard on the people that were related to"
5176,A,"you know, I mean, it is a rather final solution,"
5177,B,"Yeah,"
5178,B,"right,"
5179,B,"once, once a person's, you know, gone, then it's,"
5180,B,"but the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life, you know."
5181,A,Yes.
5182,A,"What, what do you think is, uh, is an appropriate, uh, punishment for some of the various, you know, such as, things such as rape or, or, uh, murder or something like that."
5183,B,"Well for, for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders, I think the death penalty is,"
5184,B,it's a pretty good thing.
5185,A,I agree with that.
5186,B,"They, they have that down here in Florida still."
5187,B,They the electric chair
5188,B,"and, uh,"
5189,A,"Yeah,"
5190,A,"I think Virginia does, too, up here."
5191,B,"Oh, do they?"
5192,B,"Yeah,"
5193,B,"I think, I think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy"
5194,B,"and, I guess usually they're, they're always sure they got the right guy,"
5195,B,"but, uh,"
5196,A,"Yeah,"
5197,A,I think the appeal process takes too long.
5198,B,"Yeah,"
5199,B,so do I.
5200,A,"I think, I, I think it should take, from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year."
5201,B,"Yeah,"
5202,B,if that.
5203,B,"You know, the sooner,"
5204,B,"a, a, a year's plenty of time you know, for something to come out, I guess."
5205,A,Uh-huh.
5206,B,"Then, you know, there's been guys in jail for six years"
5207,B,and the other guy admits that he did it
5208,B,and they
5209,B,"it's like oops,"
5210,A,"Well, yeah,"
5211,A,"I mean, the system isn't perfect,"
5212,A,"I mean, it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans."
5213,A,"You do the best you can to make it perfect, you know,"
5214,A,"you, you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect."
5215,B,Right.
5216,A,"But, I think you have to accept some of the errors."
5217,A,"I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if, if there was a credible punishment, uh, for murderers."
5218,B,"Um, yeah,"
5219,B,I don't know if it would or not though.
5220,B,"I, I don't think it's a, so much of a deterrent as, as it is a, a good, uh, a good way for vengeance, you know, for the relatives and, and family members,"
5221,B,you know what I mean?
5222,A,"And society probably, too."
5223,B,Yeah.
5224,A,"I mean, just general society to,"
5225,B,"Yeah,"
5226,B,it kind of gets it off their chest.
5227,A,"Uh,"
5228,A,"Yeah,"
5229,A,it does
5230,A,"and, and it decreases the prison population. And, which is significant"
5231,B,"Yeah,"
5232,B,"I know that a, a lot of the lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other."
5233,A,"I mean, Yeah."
5234,B,"And they're the, kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that."
5235,B,"I don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead,"
5236,B,"but, I, you might be able to, uh, stop people, you know,"
5237,B,"they're thinking about it,"
5238,B,they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught.
5239,A,"Yeah,"
5240,A,"generally the crimes of passion and things like that, uh, are not premeditated."
5241,B,Right.
5242,A,"I mean, they can be,"
5243,A,but usually they aren't.
5244,B,Yeah.
5245,A,They're spur of the moment
5246,B,That's right.
5247,A,"and, uh, the premeditated murders, the ones where the person plots and plans, when you catch those, those individuals, I think that you, you end up with a, uh, uh, how do I want to, you end up with a you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time."
5248,B,Yeah.
5249,B,"Yeah,"
5250,B,they could probably do it again.
5251,A,"Yes,"
5252,A,"they, they would have no problems doing it again."
5253,B,"That's right,"
5254,B,they didn't have any time doing it the first time.
5255,A,Uh-huh.
5256,A,"And I think locking them up for, you know, fifty years doesn't do a, any good because as a, as a taxpayer, I'm going to pay, you know, one and a,"
5257,B,"No,"
5258,B,it
5259,B,Okay.
5260,B,Thanks.
5261,A,Huh.
5262,A,Do you all have a budget?
5263,B,"Well, uh, yeah,"
5264,B,"we, we do."
5265,B,"Um, we've been married for twenty-three years"
5266,A,Uh-huh.
5267,B,"and we have, uh, three teenage daughters"
5268,B,"and, you know, they're very expensive."
5269,B,"So, uh, uh, we, yeah, we have somewhat of, uh, a system."
5270,B,"Uh, it's, it's kind of, uh, you know, it's kind of hard to explain."
5271,A,Yeah.
5272,B,"We've actually gone, uh, just recently, to you know having, having two checking accounts."
5273,B,We always had just one.
5274,A,Uh-huh.
5275,B,And now we are having two.
5276,B,"Uh, it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal."
5277,A,Yeah.
5278,A,"It's, uh,"
5279,B,"So, I have to be."
5280,B,That's that's kind of the way I feel about it.
5281,A,Yeah.
5282,A,"I usually, uh,"
5283,A,my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances
5284,A,"and of course, we're like like a lot of people."
5285,A,"We just scramble through month to month, you know."
5286,B,Yes.
5287,A,"And, uh,"
5288,B,Do you have a two income family or one income?
5289,A,"Uh, we have a two income uh family."
5290,B,Yeah.
5291,A,She also works
5292,B,Yeah.
5293,A,"and, uh, but she, she enjoys it"
5294,A,and she's good at it.
5295,A,"Uh, if it's, if it's,"
5296,A,"I am kind of, uh, uh, I'm pretty bad about procrastinating"
5297,B,Uh-huh.
5298,A,and one of these days I am going to do something about that
5299,B,Yeah.
5300,B,Yeah.
5301,A,"You know how that goes,"
5302,A,"but, uh, uh, if, she, she handles it pretty well."
5303,A,"She, uh she writes all the checks, you know, once a month."
5304,B,"So your wife,"
5305,B,Yes.
5306,B,It
5307,B,that
5308,B,what
5309,B,"her, is her career, uh, related to, to finance or accounting?"
5310,A,"Uh, sort of on a peripheral."
5311,A,"She's, uh, uh, an annuity administrator"
5312,B,Oh.
5313,A,"and so she, uh, she works for an insurance company."
5314,B,Uh-huh.
5315,A,"But, but she enjoys it."
5316,A,She likes keeping track of all that stuff
5317,A,"and, uh,"
5318,B,"Yeah,"
5319,B,so that's sort of related to her field a little bit.
5320,A,Yeah
5321,A,sort of.
5322,B,Yeah.
5323,A,"And we, you know, we've experimented with, with, uh, budgets, you know from time to time, uh,"
5324,A,"but, if, you know,"
5325,A,you have to keep up with them.
5326,A,"So a lot of times, we just, uh, just kind of play it by ear."
5327,A,"We try to keep our, uh, our retirement and our savings kind of automated"
5328,B,Yeah.
5329,A,so we never see that money.
5330,A,Just like taken directly.
5331,B,"It's just taking it out, right."
5332,B,Right.
5333,B,Yeah.
5334,A,Yeah.
5335,B,Yeah.
5336,B,We do the same thing.
5337,A,"And that, that's kind of handy."
5338,A,"Yeah,"
5339,A,"because if you don't see it, you don't miss it"
5340,B,"Yeah,"
5341,B,if
5342,A,You don't spend it.
5343,B,you have something to take it out.
5344,B,That's exactly what we've always done
5345,A,Yeah.
5346,B,"and we've had, uh, they've always had, uh, where they match your funds, you know,"
5347,B,"sometimes if you, if you save so much, then they will match it."
5348,A,Uh-huh.
5349,B,"Uh, that, you know, we've done that too."
5350,B,"But, my husband works for an insurance company"
5351,A,Uh-huh.
5352,B,"and he, he has now for about, oh gosh, how long has it been, ten years I guess."
5353,B,"But he was with another company before that,"
5354,B,"but we have, we have,"
5355,B,"I, I work also,"
5356,B,but I only have a part time job
5357,A,Uh-huh.
5358,B,and I get paid very little
5359,B,"but, uh, you know, I try to use that money for food"
5360,B,Jim gives me a certain amount money.
5361,B,"You know, we just transfer it into my account"
5362,A,Yeah.
5363,A,Uh-huh.
5364,B,"and then I use that for food, household expenses,"
5365,B,and then I add my own check to that
5366,B,"and then with that I try and handle, you know, some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that,"
5367,A,Yeah.
5368,B,but the expenses that we need and have around the house.
5369,A,Yeah.
5370,A,It  sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do.
5371,B,So.
5372,A,"Just kind of play it by ear, but keep the, the deductions  you know"
5373,B,Yeah.
5374,B,"Yeah,"
5375,B,we
5376,B,"well Jim has, Jim has a budget."
5377,B,I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down.
5378,A,Uh-huh.
5379,B,"Uh, you know. I am given so much money a month,"
5380,B,so I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that.
5381,A,Uh-huh.
5382,B,"So, I try not to, you know,"
5383,B,"we don't, you know, I don't ask for more."
5384,B,I mean I just try and make it on that.
5385,A,Uh-huh.
5386,A,Yeah
5387,B,"Because I think when you go to the grocery store, you can just, you can go crazy with all the choices that you have"
5388,A,Yeah.
5389,A,Uh-huh.
5390,B,"and, uh, you can, you can really waste a lot of money that way."
5391,A,Yeah.
5392,B,"So, uh, well how long have you been married?"
5393,A,"Uh, about five years."
5394,A,Yeah.
5395,B,"Oh, yeah."
5396,B,So you're just really getting started
5397,B,So do you have a family too?
5398,A,"Uh, I've got one little girl."
5399,A,"She's like, uh, nineteen months."
5400,B,Oh yeah.
5401,B,Yeah.
5402,A,"So, uh, she's, she's not, uh,"
5403,B,She hasn't effected your budget yet really.
5404,A,"Not, not really."
5405,A,Not too bad. Uh.
5406,B,No.
5407,B,Not like she will later on.
5408,A,Yeah.
5409,B,"You will see that  all of a sudden you're paying, you're trying to decide whether you are going to do, you know, soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do"
5410,A,Yeah
5411,A,"when,"
5412,A,Uh-huh.
5413,B,"and then you really have to start saying okay, now what can we afford you know,"
5414,A,Yeah.
5415,B,what can we do here
5416,B,and then you have to really sit down and plan some more
5417,B,"and, uh, but I think when we were back at your age, we didn't have much of a budget"
5418,A,Yeah.
5419,B,"and then as the girls got older, I think we, we did more and more of that."
5420,B,"You know, more budgeting as as they got older."
5421,A,Uh-huh.
5422,B,"Uh, but uh, but what do you do?"
5423,B,"Do you,"
5424,A,"I'm uh, I, I work for, I'm an electronic technician."
5425,B,"Oh, okay."
5426,A,"I work at a, for a university. Uh, Georgia Tech, uh, research"
5427,B,Oh.
5428,B,Well good.
5429,A,"and, uh,"
5430,B,Good.
5431,A,"So I just, uh,"
5432,B,"Well, we just have, you know, we have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta."
5433,B,I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things.
5434,B,I'd better get back to the subject.
5435,A,"Oh, well"
5436,B,"But, uh, budgeting."
5437,B,"I found, you know, I feel a lot better."
5438,B,"You know, we use to work out of one check book"
5439,A,Uh-huh.
5440,B,"and it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month."
5441,A,Yeah.
5442,B,"Now, I have, know exactly what I'm spending"
5443,B,"and it's so much easier,"
5444,B,"Uh, well, having"
5445,B,of the reason going through the school system
5446,B,"I seem to be younger than most people who, who talk on this thing."
5447,B,"I'm, I'm just graduating graduating from college."
5448,B,"Uh, I didn't really perceive much of a, of a problem with the school system."
5449,B,"However, when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and"
5450,B,you can compare just about thing to Japan
5451,B,need to separate every th and we look like we don't have anything.
5452,B,"Uh, it seems to be not difficult enough for students. Not challenging enough. And just not generally competitive enough."
5453,B,"Uh, however, I, if it weren't for our needless, uh, competition with Japan, I, I'd, I'd think that, that, the school systems, system works at a pretty good pace."
5454,A,I don't know.
5455,A,"Uh, I haven't,"
5456,A,"it's been, uh, well seventy-nine since I was at school. At high school."
5457,B,Uh-huh.
5458,A,"And, uh, I've seen things change."
5459,A,"I don't know if I've seen things change enough that I can actually,"
5460,A,because I wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then
5461,A,so it's hard to compare.
5462,A,You know what I mean?
5463,B,Right.
5464,A,"But, uh, it seems like when I I lived in Chicago,"
5465,A,"I, I've lived down here."
5466,A,"I hear the dropout rates from the schools,"
5467,A,and I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year.
5468,B,Yeah.
5469,A,And I begin to wonder if I'm really getting my money's worth.
5470,B,Huh.
5471,A,"I mean, I, I've seen so many different things. So, so many different bad reports coming out of the school system"
5472,A,and I recognize that there are good schools out there.
5473,A,"I mean, somebody's  getting, getting a good education because we, continue to employ people."
5474,B,Right.
5475,A,"But, uh, I don't, I don't understand the, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities."
5476,B,"Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either."
5477,B,"Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools."
5478,B,"But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the, the dropout rate is, in those areas,"
5479,B,"it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and, and crime."
5480,B,And they all seem to go together.
5481,B,"And it seems like if you could eliminate one of, of the parts of that circle, whether, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better."
5482,B,"So, uh, the other two"
5483,B,"they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to, to fix"
5484,B,"but it's just like, I, I don't expect them to know which, which, which part is best to fix just like I don't know."
5485,B,"It's, it's a complicated issue."
5486,B,"I, I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school."
5487,A,I don't know if I blame it on the school.
5488,A,"I think, I think I blame it, I think I blame it on a couple of different things."
5489,A,"I think I blame it on the school system. Uh,"
5490,B,"Well, that's I meant when I said the school."
5491,A,Yeah.
5492,A,I don't blame it on the teachers in the school.
5493,A,"I, although I think that,"
5494,A,"I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than,"
5495,A,"well, they do quite well for themselves"
5496,B,Huh.
5497,B,"Well, that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district, uh, were well paid."
5498,A,No.
5499,A,Not all school districts are well paid.
5500,A,But there are some school districts out there that are very well paid.
5501,A,"I mean I know one family that's got,"
5502,A,"they're both teachers,"
5503,A,"and they both have, like second jobs that they work in the afternoons."
5504,B,Uh-huh.
5505,A,They both work all summer full-time.
5506,A,"And from their teaching job alone, they pull in forty grand each."
5507,B,Yeah.
5508,B,"Well, it, it,"
5509,A,I mean that family is making over a hundred grand.
5510,A,"And I'm,"
5511,A,"I mean, okay,"
5512,A,okay.
5513,A,"Yes,"
5514,A,I agree that teaching our kids is important.
5515,B,Right.
5516,A,"However, these people who only work eight hours day at it, from seven to three,"
5517,A,and they only work nine months a year
5518,A,and they get an awful lot of breaks in between
5519,A,and that's my tax dollars that I'm spending on that.
5520,A,And I don't even have kids
5521,B,"Yeah,"
5522,B,well that's true.
5523,B,"But there's,"
5524,B,"you can always play games with, uh, talking about, whoa, look at this."
5525,B,My tax dollars are paying for this.
5526,B,This is wrong.
5527,B,"But, when you're"
5528,B,and there's really not much you can directly do about that.
5529,B,"I think that, that if, if there is a problem with the school system, uh, from, it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well, uh, paid. That perhaps that might be one area that, that could be improved."
5530,B,"Uh,"
5531,B,you have other professional jobs
5532,B,and this is a profession.
5533,B,"And, as a matter of fact, it's a pretty big influence on, on"
5534,A,"So, do you, your privacy being invaded at any time?"
5535,B,"Well, uh, one of the things that, uh, that I found to be, uh, an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the, on the, uh, credit card bill."
5536,B,That  is something that is not required
5537,A,"Well,"
5538,A,Right.
5539,B,"and, in fact, uh, it is actually prohibited"
5540,B,"but it doesn't stop many people many people from, uh, from doing it."
5541,B,"And it's one of the things that it's used for, primarily, is for demographic, uh, research."
5542,B,"And to get your, your phone number on, uh, uh, lists for phone solicitations."
5543,A,Yeah.
5544,A,Yeah.
5545,A,"Now that you can still, yeah,"
5546,A,I've always done that.
5547,A,"I started,"
5548,A,once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse
5549,A,and I say what are you going to do.
5550,A,You going to say you don't want to sell me this product then  that's fine.
5551,B,Uh-huh.
5552,A,I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all.
5553,A,"And then, ultimately, they say, no"
5554,A,you don't have to put it down
5555,A,"But, uh, really it's part of this compliance thing."
5556,B,Uh-huh.
5557,A,"Uh, the thing I don't like,"
5558,A,"I know that certain states actually sell their, uh, their lists like, uh, motor vehicles."
5559,B,Uh-huh.
5560,A,"That really burns me because, hey, you're required."
5561,A,You have to do that.
5562,B,Right.
5563,A,And nowhere does it say you asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone.
5564,B,Uh-huh.
5565,A,"And I think that, it, it's one thing to, uh, voluntarily give it because someone asks."
5566,A,You can always refuse
5567,A,but it's another thing where it's required by law
5568,A,"and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody.  You know,"
5569,B,Right.
5570,B,"Uh, That,"
5571,A,"I don't think, I don't think they have the right to do that."
5572,B,I agree with you there.
5573,B,"That's something that, uh, people have seen."
5574,B,"Oh, here's an easy way to make some money."
5575,B,"But, uh, I don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not."
5576,B,"I, I've heard, fairly recently, uh, some talk about that in this, in, in my state."
5577,B,"Uh, the budget problems up here are, are pretty tense."
5578,B,"And people are looking for alternate ways of, uh,"
5579,B,"enhancing revenue is the, uh, phrase they use."
5580,B,And they were talking about selling the D M V lists
5581,B,"and there was a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, consternation about that"
5582,B,and the last I heard they'd backed down from that idea.
5583,B,"But it really makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made, uh, public that you, don't know about."
5584,A,"Well, that's easy."
5585,A,Whenever you donate money to someone?
5586,B,Uh-huh.
5587,A,"They, you become, put on something like a sucker list"
5588,A,and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations.
5589,B,Right.
5590,A,And then you
5591,A,it kind of makes you feel from doing it again.
5592,B,Uh-huh.
5593,A,"Like, uh, National Public Radio or any of these, the public, uh, stations, you know."
5594,B,Uh-huh.
5595,A,"I, I, I, I think I sent in, in money for, once to, uh, to public, uh, T V."
5596,B,Uh-huh.
5597,A,And I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine.
5598,B,Huh.
5599,A,"I,"
5600,A,it's like
5601,A,and it just started soon after I had done that one.
5602,B,Right.
5603,A,"And I just said this is, this is terrible"
5604,A,"Uh, and that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old Alma Mater in college."
5605,B,Uh-huh.
5606,A,"And, uh, it's one thing,"
5607,A,they don't sell the list.
5608,A,"But the thing that makes me mad is, uh, then they start getting, uh, other people,"
5609,A,the people do these phonathons
5610,B,Right.
5611,A,and they call you up
5612,A,"and they actually happen to be people who are, graduated in your class or something like that."
5613,A,"And, and they say, oh, we, we know you."
5614,A,"You, uh, had, uh, contributed x amount last year."
5615,A,Can you do better this year?
5616,A,"And, you know, like hold on here."
5617,B,How do you know that?
5618,A,"Who, how do you know that?"
5619,A,"Why, why you even telling me this?"
5620,A,Is it any of your business?
5621,A,"I mean, it's one thing that I, and the college knows that"
5622,A,"that's, just our business."
5623,A,There's no need for someone  who is soliciting should know at all.
5624,B,Uh-huh.
5625,A,"Just, uh,"
5626,A,and that was very offensive too.
5627,A,"I,"
5628,A,and so very
5629,B,"Last year, the, uh, Lotus Development Company, the, uh company that puts out One, Two, Three was planning on marketing a, uh, C D Rom with people's names sorted by number of different criteria."
5630,A,Uh-huh.
5631,A,Right
5632,B,One way or another we're now recording.
5633,A,Okay.
5634,B,"Um, um, oh, yeah."
5635,B,Home repair.
5636,A,You were helping your parents.
5637,B,Right.
5638,B,I still am really.
5639,B,"They're, uh, like some sort of sort of remodeling a house out in downtown Atlanta, in Candler Park."
5640,A,Uh-huh.
5641,B,"And, uh, we've done lots to it."
5642,B,We've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them.
5643,B,"And,"
5644,A,So you're remodeling?
5645,B,Uh-huh.
5646,A,Okay.
5647,B,How about you?
5648,A,"Well, I, I just live in a, I live in an apartment now."
5649,A,"I, uh, two summers ago I went to Massachusetts"
5650,B,Uh-huh.
5651,A,and I went with a friend of mine
5652,A,and we undertook a building house.
5653,B,Uh-huh.
5654,A,"And this was a, a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions"
5655,A,and it's preconstructed you might say.
5656,B,Uh-huh
5657,A,"And we started in, uh, we, started from an empty lot with, uh, trees and stuff on it"
5658,A,"and we had to cut them, uh, down and clear the lot."
5659,A,"We had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement. Pour the basement and, uh, went from the ground up."
5660,B,Wow.
5661,A,"Our  one of our main problems was,"
5662,B,Wow.
5663,A,"well in Massachusetts, I thought I was going to,"
5664,A,"well, it was a, a fun time"
5665,A,"but  I thought, gosh, summer time, you know."
5666,B,Uh-huh.
5667,A,"Well, all it ever did was rain and thunder storms"
5668,A,"And one thing is that we're, we had, we were going to pour the basement foundation."
5669,B,Uh-huh.
5670,A,And we're in the process
5671,A,and it started pouring down rain.
5672,B,Huh.
5673,A,And I guess we had most of it done
5674,A,"but the end was result,"
5675,A,"what happened was that some of the, the a lot of water settled on the top"
5676,A,and it really didn't give a very good finish
5677,A,"and some of the,"
5678,A,"it was sort of sandy and  and not, uh, a very good finish."
5679,B,Uh-huh.
5680,B,Uh-huh.
5681,A,"But it turned, it was okay"
5682,A,and it's only the basement floor
5683,A,so it was okay.
5684,B,Yeah.
5685,A,"But, uh, it kept us pretty busy."
5686,A,"It was only, uh,"
5687,A,"there was, well me and my friend"
5688,A,"and then we just had like two helpers and  uh, sort of a, a family type,"
5689,B,Uh-huh.
5690,A,"it wasn't, you know, like a commercial project or something."
5691,A,"It was sort of just, you know, uh, gets your, get his, you know, my my brother and well, maybe, you know, my cousin's coming over today to help us do that  kind of thing. So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes."
5692,B,Uh-huh.
5693,B,Wow.
5694,A,"And, and then materials coming in"
5695,B,Uh-huh.
5696,A,"and so we're, we're hopping around pretty good."
5697,A,"But overall, yeah, we got it done"
5698,A,"and it's a three bedroom, two bath house"
5699,A,and it's pretty neat.
5700,B,Nice.
5701,A,Yeah.
5702,A,So.
5703,B,Nice.
5704,B,"So, uh, I mean what was it for?"
5705,B,"You just,"
5706,A,"Well, it was, uh, for my friend's parents."
5707,A,They had some property there
5708,A,"and they'd lived in this, this old,"
5709,A,"it's sort of like a farm, you might say."
5710,A,And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something.
5711,B,Uh-huh.
5712,A,"And his mom just wanted a, a new house. You know,"
5713,B,Uh-huh.
5714,A,that has been her dream.
5715,A,"And so, we did that."
5716,A,"And, uh, she was really pleased with it."
5717,A,So it came  really great
5718,B,That's great.
5719,A,so.
5720,B,Wow.
5721,A,"So what, why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot."
5722,B,Huh?
5723,A,Where you live it gets very hot?
5724,B,"Yeah,"
5725,B,it does.
5726,A,"And that's why you,"
5727,A,"and the windows have you, what type of windows are you putting in?"
5728,B,Huh.
5729,A,"Because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in, uh, you know, the solar game?"
5730,B,Right.
5731,A,"Have you,"
5732,A,"what, what, are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or,"
5733,B,No.
5734,B,"We just, we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass."
5735,B,My parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it.
5736,A,"Oh, okay."
5737,A,Okay.
5738,B,"And, uh, but it,"
5739,B,see in a lot of the windows?
5740,A,Uh-huh.
5741,B,"Uh, it's, the house is eighty years old"
5742,B,and it's had several owners and stuff
5743,B,"and, uh  they have put plastic, Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows."
5744,A,Okay.
5745,A,"Oh, these"
5746,A,so you have the sash windows in?
5747,B,Uh-huh.
5748,A,"Did uh, did it go up and down?"
5749,B,Uh-huh.
5750,A,"Oh, I see."
5751,B,Yeah.
5752,B,"And so, uh, and, and so we wanted to get all new stuff in there."
5753,A,Uh-huh.
5754,B,So.
5755,A,"Yes,"
5756,A,there's a problem with those.
5757,A,"Those are, uh,"
5758,A,they usually most of the time don't open very well
5759,B,Yeah.
5760,B,Ours didn't
5761,A,Uh-huh.
5762,B,"And the ones that would open, uh, wouldn't want to stay open"
5763,B,They wanted  to slam shut.
5764,A,Uh-huh.
5765,A,Uh-huh.
5766,A,"And they also, there, they, they,"
5767,A,a lot of vibration
5768,A,and it causes the glass to crack
5769,A,and it's  a never ending problem.
5770,B,Uh-huh.
5771,B,Uh-huh.
5772,B,Yeah.
5773,A,"So. So I haven't, uh, I haven't been in any really home repair things lately."
5774,A,"I,"
5775,A,"Uh, being a former drug user I, uh, I, I guess I have to say at this point, that I do approve of it."
5776,B,Whoa.
5777,B,Uh-huh.
5778,A,"Uh, because I know that, uh, in using drugs I was not a good employee."
5779,B,Uh-huh.
5780,A,"And so I can see from the company's standpoint that there, uh,"
5781,A,"whenever you are an employee of the company, you are using its assets,"
5782,A,"and, uh, you are also under their liability, under the Workmen's Comp."
5783,B,Uh-huh.
5784,A,"Uh, on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases"
5785,B,Where do you work?
5786,B,Oh.
5787,A,"And, uh, it's also a retreading plant,"
5788,A,"and that's where most of our, uh, injuries occur."
5789,B,Uh-huh.
5790,A,"And what we do is we'll have a drug test if an, if a, a break or a man, uh, has an accident."
5791,A,"Then he's automatically, uh, given a drug test."
5792,B,Right.
5793,B,"Do they do it, like, you know, within hours of the accident,"
5794,B,or is it?
5795,A,"Yes,"
5796,A,when he goes to the doctor the first time.
5797,B,Yeah.
5798,A,"And so, that kind of, uh,"
5799,A,"I don't know if it's been a deterrent or not, because we have, uh, just started using it oh, for the past year or so."
5800,B,Uh-huh.
5801,B,Yeah.
5802,A,"Now we've let some people go, uh, that we, was found that drugs were used in their system."
5803,A,"Now, I don't know how T E C would handle it."
5804,A,"They haven't pursued it, you know."
5805,B,Uh-huh.
5806,A,"Uh, if there's some, uh, problem I know,"
5807,A,"there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines,"
5808,A,"and he went to a, a separate drug testing firm,"
5809,B,Yeah.
5810,A,and they showed it negative.
5811,B,Huh.
5812,A,"So I think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried, you know."
5813,B,Yeah.
5814,B,"Yeah,"
5815,B,"I think that's probably true, too."
5816,B,"That's, that's, that's sort of scary."
5817,A,"Uh-huh,"
5818,A,really.
5819,A,And then I also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine.
5820,B,Yeah.
5821,A,And he tested positive on cocaine.
5822,A,"Now then you always wonder, well is he just saying that"
5823,B,"Yeah,"
5824,B,"yeah,"
5825,B,"really,"
5826,B,really.
5827,A,Yeah.
5828,B,"Yeah,"
5829,B,"that's, that's a bad situation."
5830,B,"I think that probably, I think most companies now, as far as entry, you know, exams require that."
5831,A,Uh-huh.
5832,A,Yeah.
5833,B,I think they should.
5834,A,Uh-huh.
5835,B,I'm a T I employee
5836,B,"and and, and, uh, I'm, I'm really gung ho for it."
5837,A,Uh-huh.
5838,B,"In fact I, you know,"
5839,B,"some of the places now, um, like I B M don't allow them smoking, you know in, in the plant."
5840,A,Uh-huh.
5841,A,Right.
5842,B,"We, we have designated smoking areas."
5843,A,Yeah.
5844,B,"But, um, I work in sort of a building that's, that's not really, well"
5845,B,"it's on the campus of the T I facility,"
5846,B,"but it's a little bit, you know, separated."
5847,B,We lease the building.
5848,B,"And it's, it's a factory environment."
5849,A,Uh-huh.
5850,B,"And, uh, they, they have designated smoking,"
5851,B,"but it's just wide open,"
5852,B,it's not ventilated properly
5853,A,Yeah.
5854,B,and I think that's bad.
5855,B,"But as far as the drugs, you know, being in the factory kind of environment that way I think it's a, it's a definite, I think it's essential."
5856,A,"Uh-huh,"
5857,A,uh-huh.
5858,A,"Yeah,"
5859,A,because you're endangering everybody's lives if you if it's something like that.
5860,B,Yeah.
5861,B,"In fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years,"
5862,A,Uh-huh.
5863,B,"and, uh, I, I was giving my boss a hard time because I kept waiting for my name to came, come up, you know,"
5864,B,"they never, they never called me,"
5865,B,"they never, you know,"
5866,B,"and finally, the day we declared war was my time"
5867,A,You're kidding
5868,B,No
5869,B,"And so, and, and my boss has, has gone for about like three times, I think."
5870,B,And I told him he's obviously in a high risk group
5871,A,"The executives, right?"
5872,B,"Right,"
5873,B,"right,"
5874,B,"and of course, you know, they did being moved around and making specifically single them out when we started, you know, that they were going to do all them first."
5875,A,The executives?
5876,B,Uh-huh.
5877,A,Yeah.
5878,A,"Wouldn't that be awful if you were  if you were using, and, and oh, lose your job and everything."
5879,B,Which I thought was interesting
5880,B,"Oh, man,"
5881,B,yeah.
5882,B,"Ooh, yeah."
5883,A,I can't believe I was so brazen before.
5884,A,"I, like I say, I'm a former drug user,"
5885,B,Uh-huh.
5886,A,"but, uh, I, I, well, I, I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior,"
5887,A,and so I don't use drugs any more.
5888,B,"Oh, what kind of drugs did you use, if you don't mind?"
5889,A,"Uh, marijuana, cocaine and amphetamines."
5890,B,Wow!
5891,A,"Um, yes,"
5892,A,uh-huh
5893,A,"And all on the job, too."
5894,B,Really?
5895,A,"You know, it had gotten that bad."
5896,B,"Well, it's really lucky that you got away from that."
5897,A,"Really,"
5898,B,"Cause that's really,  downward spiral."
5899,A,"it's, it's"
5900,A,life is so much more enjoyable.
5901,A,Uh-huh.
5902,A,"And I was losing jobs just from doing a poor job, you know."
5903,B,Yeah.
5904,B,"Yeah,"
5905,B,"that's, that's it."
5906,A,"I mean, you know, there's all kinds of drawbacks, much less the drug testing."
5907,B,Yeah.
5908,B,Just life in general.
5909,A,"Uh-huh,"
5910,A,that's right.
5911,B,"Yeah,"
5912,B,"well, well I'm definitely for it."
5913,A,Yeah.
5914,B,"Plus, you know, you, you want to think that, that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share, but that are not endangering your life,"
5915,A,That's right.
5916,B,in some cases
5917,A,"Uh-huh,"
5918,A,uh-huh.
5919,B,"like, uh, my husband, uh, several years back, worked for Motorola."
5920,A,Uh-huh.
5921,B,"And they had, you know,"
5922,B,I mean it was a chemical handling type.
5923,A,"Oh, goodness."
5924,B,"Yeah,"
5925,B,"I mean, and they have, they have some serious chemicals out there you know,"
5926,A,Yeah.
5927,B,"like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water, you know, that kind of thing."
5928,A,Yeah.
5929,B,And they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals.
5930,A,"Oh, my gosh."
5931,B,"And that's really, that's really frightening."
5932,A,Yeah.
5933,B,"So I think some place, you know, places like that, it should be like mandatory like, you know, on, on a, on a greater frequency than maybe, just, you know, paper pushers like, like I am."
5934,A,Uh-huh.
5935,A,"Right,"
5936,A,I would think there would be.
5937,B,"Well, well you'd think so"
5938,B,"but, uh,"
5939,A,But they weren't?
5940,B,I don't know if they do it till yet.
5941,A,Isn't that awful.
5942,B,"Because when he was at,"
5943,B,"course now it's been years now, because it was before, it was even before they had the, the designated smoking  type stuff, you know, at T I."
5944,A,"Uh-huh,"
5945,A,uh-huh.
5946,B,"I forgot what,"
5947,B,"I guess it was like eighty-four, eighty-five something like that."
5948,A,Yeah.
5949,B,"And they, at that time, they had no testing whatsoever."
5950,A,Huh.
5951,B,So that's scary
5952,A,Yeah.
5953,A,"That reminds me of, uh,"
5954,A,"I have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time,"
5955,A,and I have just casually asked her what he did for a living.
5956,A,"And she said, Oh, he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill, you know  where they go and dump all this toxic stuff."
5957,B,"Oh, Lord."
5958,B,Oh.
5959,A,"And I just, you know, went, Oh, where?"
5960,B,"Yeah,"
5961,B,should we move?
5962,A,Let me move as far away as possible.
5963,B,Ooh.
5964,A,"Yeah,"
5965,B,That's awful.
5966,A,"But, I'm proud, though, that, that, um, you know, I grew up in the sixties,"
5967,A,"and back then it was popular you know,"
5968,B,Uh-huh.
5969,B,Yeah.
5970,A,"but people have really wizened, you know, become wise about drugs"
5971,B,Yeah.
5972,A,"and they really have a good campaign for the young people, you know."
5973,B,Uh-huh.
5974,A,"They know it's not smart,"
5975,A,"so. So, I guess it was just a generational thing."
5976,B,Yeah.
5977,B,"Yeah,"
5978,B,"peer group is the other way now instead of,"
5979,A,"That's right,"
5980,A,and that's good.
5981,B,"Uh-huh,"
5982,B,"that's,"
5983,A,That's the best way to stop it.
5984,B,"Yeah,"
5985,B,"that, it really is."
5986,A,"Yeah,"
5987,A,"well, I think we did it."
5988,B,Okay.
5989,A,So it's good talking to you.
5990,B,"Well, I enjoyed talking to you, Cathy."
5991,A,"Yeah,"
5992,A,bye-bye
5993,A,"Okay,"
5994,A,"are you on any kind of, uh, regular exercise plan?"
5995,B,"I, I, yeah, I'm, yeah, I, I do aerobics, uh, step classes and, uh,  toning classes,"
5996,A,Step classes?
5997,B,yes.
5998,A,What's that?
5999,B,"It's, uh, it's a new, uh, form I think,"
6000,B,"uh, it's like low impact aerobics"
6001,B,"but at, it ..."
6002,A,"Oh, instead of hopping and jumping you just step"
6003,B,Uh-huh.
6004,B,"Yeah,"
6005,B,"you, you have a step"
6006,B,"and you literally step up on the step and move your arms,"
6007,B,"it's, it's, it's, it's new,"
6008,A,Huh.
6009,B,it's fun.
6010,A,I probably couldn't do that because of my knee
6011,B,"Uh-huh,"
6012,B,bad knee
6013,A,Yeah.
6014,B,"Um, and, uh, I do toning a lot and, uh, some,"
6015,B,"every once in a while I play tennis,"
6016,A,Yeah.
6017,B,I'm not too great at it
6018,B,"but I, I try to play,"
6019,A,"Yeah,"
6020,A,"I've, I've kind of gotten out of the habit myself,"
6021,A,"I mean, it's"
6022,A,"I guess what I do now is I play softball, right now,"
6023,B,Uh-huh.
6024,A,"that's about,"
6025,A,"well, right now I'm on two teams"
6026,A,so it's four nights a week.
6027,B,Gosh
6028,A,"But, uh, uh, so I enjoy it"
6029,A,"but, as far as, you know, uh,"
6030,B,Uh-huh.
6031,A,"instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there, I went and bought a weight bench, and don't ever hardly use it."
6032,B,Uh-huh.
6033,B,"Ha,"
6034,B,"right,"
6035,A,I need to make myself do that.
6036,B,"yeah,"
6037,B,"I slacked off a little because of, um,"
6038,B,I'm about to graduate from college
6039,B,and so this past couple months have been really hectic
6040,B,"so I haven't really gone,"
6041,B,and I've really faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out
6042,B,but ...
6043,A,What school you going to?
6044,B,I'm at East Carolina.
6045,A,Oh
6046,B,"But, um, no,"
6047,B,"I, uh,"
6048,B,my step classes and toning is about the only thing
6049,B,"well, I mean ..."
6050,A,"Now what's, what's toning?"
6051,A,Is that lifting weights?
6052,B,"It's, um, like isolated movements for each muscle certain muscles groups,"
6053,A,"Oh, okay."
6054,B,"you can do with,"
6055,A,"Isometrics, stuff like that."
6056,B,"Yeah,"
6057,B,"you can do it with certain, you know, you can do it with weights if you wanted to"
6058,B,"but, you know, you leave out of there"
6059,B,"usually the next morning, if you haven't done it in a while, you wake up the next morning"
6060,B,"you're like, oh, no,"
6061,B,what did I do to myself
6062,B,"and your whole body aches, you know."
6063,A,Yeah.
6064,B,"Um, I know I'm looking forward to getting back into getting into shape,"
6065,B,"uh, I feel like I'm out of shape"
6066,B,"but I feel guilty for not going, because I really I'm, I'm so used to going for, you know, three or four years now."
6067,A,Uh-huh.
6068,A,"Yeah,"
6069,A,"I, stayed in pretty good shape during school."
6070,B,"But, um,"
6071,A,"I played baseball, all the way through"
6072,B,Uh-huh.
6073,A,"and, you know, working out six hours a day, usually six or seven days a week that kind of, kept us all in pretty good shape,"
6074,B,"Oh, yeah."
6075,B,"Oh, yeah."
6076,A,"But, uh, ever, ever since I got out of school, you know, just jumped right into the job"
6077,A,"and, I guess the job that I'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule. *listen; possible typo stuff = tough?"
6078,B,Uh-huh.
6079,B,Uh-huh.
6080,A,Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling.
6081,B,Uh-huh.
6082,B,"No,"
6083,B,"some, um,"
6084,B,"I walk a lot because, uh, you know, being in, in school we,"
6085,A,Yeah.
6086,B,"I don't know if your campus was anything like ours,"
6087,B,"but our parking lot's in one end of the, of the campus"
6088,B,"and the school, the buildings are all at the other end,"
6089,B,so.
6090,A,"No,"
6091,A,"I didn't have, well, much of a problem"
6092,A,"we, I guess I went to a small Baptist school"
6093,A,"and we had about, when I was there, maybe thirteen hundred people."
6094,B,Uh-huh.
6095,B,"Oh, okay,"
6096,B,that's if ...
6097,A,"So, it's pretty small."
6098,A,Yeah.
6099,B,Yeah.
6100,B,Yeah.
6101,A,But I usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant.
6102,B,Uh-huh.
6103,A,"So,"
6104,B,"Yeah,"
6105,B,"it's, uh,"
6106,B,"I live, I live on the second story apartments"
6107,B,"so I walk up and down stairs all day long,"
6108,B,so.
6109,B,"Uh,"
6110,A,"Uh, we've got a one story house now"
6111,A,"that's, that's enough."
6112,A,I guess I push the lawn mower around
6113,A,"that's, fairly regular"
6114,B,Yeah
6115,B,"one of the exercise,"
6116,A,Yeah.
6117,B,"I, I, um, would like to start running."
6118,B,I've never been much of a runner
6119,B,"but I want to start,"
6120,B,I want to run
6121,B,"but I don't, I don't know if I'll be able to, to do it."
6122,A,What
6123,A,"just, because you don't like to or because, because you won't be able to."
6124,B,"I'm, I'm afraid I won't be able to."
6125,A,"Oh, if you do, if you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running."
6126,B,I
6127,B,Yeah.
6128,B,"I hope not. Um,"
6129,A,"We've, we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough"
6130,B,Uh-huh.
6131,B,"I don't even own a bike,"
6132,B,"I think the last time I was on a bike when I was about twelve,"
6133,B,so.
6134,B,"Uh, I don't know,"
6135,B,"I'd be afraid, afraid I probably forgot how to ride a bike, you know."
6136,A,"No,"
6137,A,you can't forget how to ride a bike.
6138,B,"Yeah,"
6139,B,"but, um, no,"
6140,B,"I guess that's about the only form,"
6141,B,"I'm trying to think of, of other things that I do that will be considered exercise,"
6142,A,Yeah.
6143,B,there are things I should do.
6144,B,I know
6145,A,"Now, when I was going to,"
6146,A,"I, I went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred,"
6147,A,"well, when we were at this junior college, uh, our coach, you know,"
6148,A,"we,"
6149,A,one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics
6150,A,and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting.
6151,B,Uh-huh.
6152,A,"So, they, uh,"
6153,A,"I mean, it was a regular,"
6154,A,"I mean, we had it for course credit,"
6155,B,Uh-huh.
6156,A,"but still, I mean, it was pretty high impact stuff,"
6157,B,"Those aerobic classes are, are tough the, the high impact."
6158,A,Uh-huh.
6159,B,"Definitely are, are tough classes."
6160,A,"Yeah,"
6161,A,"and she'd, uh, you know,"
6162,A,most of the guys were all in one class
6163,A,"so she'd kind of lay it on occasionally, you know,"
6164,B,Uh-huh.
6165,A,"First at eight, I think we had"
6166,A,"eight o'clock in the morning, was our class."
6167,B,Uh-huh.
6168,A,Wake up.
6169,B,"Well, now they have those, uh, those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight,"
6170,A,Uh-huh.
6171,B,"you have like bands,"
6172,B,"I don't know, if you've seen them,"
6173,A,Yeah.
6174,B,"they're ... Yeah, they're, they're weird."
6175,A,I think my wife has some.
6176,B,"They're, uh, you they're just made of, I guess it's different kinds of rubber,"
6177,A,Uh-huh.
6178,B,"uh, and they get,"
6179,A,"Or sand even some of them,"
6180,A,"well, no,"
6181,A,they're elastic
6182,A,so I guess it wouldn't be sand.
6183,B,Uh-huh.
6184,B,"And there's some that, like the different colors denotes how much they, how much the tension I guess they are and how easy they are to move."
6185,A,Huh.
6186,B,"Uh, there's like, I know there's purple, gray, and, uh, green."
6187,B,And some of them are real short
6188,B,"and they're the ones that are the tough ones to use, you know."
6189,A,Yeah.
6190,B,"But, uh, those classes I, I enjoy."
6191,B,"Uh, I think, uh, with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that's fun."
6192,B,"If you don't have one that's fun, and not enjoy it, look, not acting like she's enjoying what she's doing, the class is not going to get out, uh, what they should get out of the class."
6193,A,Yeah.
6194,B,"Uh, if the,"
6195,A,"So, are you going to get into instructing?"
6196,A,"Well, what are you studying?"
6197,B,"Oh, I'm an interior design major,"
6198,A,"Oh, okay,"
6199,A,"not in the, not in the, aerobic instructor type field."
6200,B,Oh.
6201,B,"No,"
6202,B,"no,"
6203,B,"no,"
6204,B,"no,"
6205,B,"oh, I could never do that I don't think,"
6206,B,"I'd rather just be the student,"
6207,B,"And, uh, Occasionally I do the weights at the health club but low weights just ..."
6208,A,Yeah.
6209,A,"Yeah,"
6210,A,"the, uh, the, some of the Nautilus equipment that I started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting,"
6211,A,"I mean, they, they, they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups, with those things"
6212,B,Uh-huh.
6213,A,"but, man, they are, it,"
6214,A,I don't know
6215,A,"to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there, and workout and then drive back"
6216,B,Uh-huh.
6217,B,Right.
6218,B,"Well, they, um, I just noticed at our health club they put these computerized one, these computerized machines,"
6219,B,and you set a speed on it and the weight
6220,B,"and it, and it makes you do it."
6221,B,And it tells you
6222,B,"like if you're going too slow it will say, my grandmother could do this faster than you. And stuff like, a turtle goes faster"
6223,B,"and, um, it tells it"
6224,B,and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you.
6225,A,A little negative reinforcement there while you're going.
6226,B,Yeah
6227,B,"So, uh, do that, stuff like that"
6228,B,but just I've never used those machines
6229,B,"I just use the regular machines and the free weights, you know, like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights."
6230,A,Yeah.
6231,B,"to do, you know, some bicep, tricep exercises."
6232,B,"Sit-ups, of course."
6233,A,"yeah,"
6234,A,"that's, that's where I'm really starting to get noticeable,"
6235,B,Uh-huh.
6236,A,I'm just getting real soft in the middle.
6237,B,"Oh, yeah,"
6238,B,"I think that's, uh, number one problem with everyone"
6239,A,Uh-huh.
6240,A,I haven't really started to put on a lot of weight
6241,A,"I'm, I guess I probably put on about ten, nine or ten pounds, since I stopped playing, which was about four years ago."
6242,B,Uh-huh.
6243,A,"But I've, just myself I just notice myself just really, real soft"
6244,A,"and I'm sure I don't have near the endurance that I did,"
6245,B,Yeah.
6246,A,"But I, I intend, I keep saying I intend to get back into it."
6247,B,Uh-huh.
6248,B,Yeah.
6249,A,"I just need to, put the old nose to the grindstone,"
6250,A,"I, I, I guess at that point it would turn into a task,"
6251,B,Uh-huh.
6252,A,"I don't consider it fun doing that,"
6253,A,but.
6254,B,Right.
6255,B,"Yeah,"
6256,B,"I plan on getting back, once I graduate next weekend."
6257,A,Next weekend?
6258,B,Next weekend.
6259,A,All right.
6260,B,"Yeah,"
6261,B,"one week,"
6262,B,Then I plan to get right back into it.
6263,B,"You know, it's, it does a lot for you I think."
6264,A,"Yeah,"
6265,B,Makes you feel a lot better.
6266,A,"oh, no,"
6267,A,"yeah,"
6268,A,"there, there's no, no question the, the end result is great"
6269,A,"and I, I mean, I enjoyed, you know,"
6270,A,"we,"
6271,A,"when I was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired, you know"
6272,B,"Uh-huh,"
6273,B,"and I mean you feel so much better, about yourself."
6274,A,Yeah.
6275,A,Uh-huh.
6276,B,"Just you know, you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner,"
6277,A,"Oh, I still don't,"
6278,A,but That's a problem.
6279,B,"Oh, yeah,"
6280,B,yeah.
6281,A,"Well, good luck on your graduation and your ..."
6282,B,"All righty,"
6283,B,"well, thank you."
6284,B,It was nice talking to you.
6285,A,"Yeah,"
6286,A,you too.
6287,B,"Okay,"
6288,B,bye-bye.
6289,A,Bye.
6290,A,"seems to be a, a topic that's going to probably take about a generation to, uh, catch on, it seems, or maybe a generation to two"
6291,A,And we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up.
6292,A,"Uh, it does seem to be a lot of habits to break."
6293,A,"I, uh, wasn't raised as a kid on it,"
6294,A,but my kids are
6295,A,"and so they, they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do,"
6296,A,"and we were doing all right there until, uh, the price dropped out"
6297,A,and they weren't worth anything anymore.
6298,B,Uh-huh.
6299,A,And we
6300,A,"it took us, almost a year to get a garbage sack full."
6301,A,We just don't drink that many.
6302,A,"So as far as at home use, uh, we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of Doctor Pepper or something"
6303,A,"and, and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in, uh,"
6304,A,"at the time it was still, oh, about forty or fifty cents a pound,"
6305,A,and we came out with about a dollar
6306,A,it just really wasn't worth it.
6307,B,And a lot of hassle all year round
6308,B,"and cans laying,"
6309,A,Yeah.
6310,B,Yeah.
6311,A,"So, they, they realized, you know,"
6312,A,"well, of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old."
6313,A,"That wasn't, uh, that was a big deal,"
6314,A,but we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it
6315,A,"and then, uh, T I started keeping up with, uh, cans there,"
6316,A,so occasionally I'll bring whatever I've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there.
6317,A,"Least it gets back into the system,"
6318,A,"but, as far as a habit at the house, uh, I haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up."
6319,A,Have you all got the individual containers yet?
6320,B,"No,"
6321,B,"I read in the paper this week where maybe,"
6322,B,"I don't know if it was,"
6323,B,I guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time.
6324,A,Um.
6325,B,"But, it, it should be starting, I would stay probably in the next month if, if everything goes that"
6326,B,"I'm not sure all what we're going to have to do, whether we have three separate containers,"
6327,B,I really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything.
6328,A,Right.
6329,A,"Yeah,"
6330,A,"it seemed like, uh,"
6331,A,"if, if I recall, it's been a long time."
6332,A,They're way behind schedule on that particular part of it.
6333,A,"They were fine on the green, big green containers"
6334,B,Uh-huh.
6335,A,"but, uh, seems like they said they were just going to have a bin"
6336,A,and all different types would go in there
6337,A,and then that they would sort it as as needed.
6338,B,Oh.
6339,A,"It, it seemed that there was,"
6340,A,"at the time anyway, it, the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that at, at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it, happen to do it pretty well, uh, those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting."
6341,A,"But when it comes down to just general purpose trash, that all the houses, uh,"
6342,A,"the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor,"
6343,A,"so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than, than having a household try it."
6344,B,Uh-huh.
6345,A,"But I, I don't know,"
6346,A,that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house.
6347,B,"Well, it would get messy, too."
6348,A,"Yeah,"
6349,A,"yeah,"
6350,B,"I, I, I know other places when they recycle, they have to, like, wash out their glass jars and whatnot. And, uh, which we're not in the habit of doing."
6351,A,Right.
6352,A,That's true.
6353,B,"I was brought up, uh, you know, long time ago, that they didn't even have cans."
6354,B,They had bottles
6355,B,and you'd return them to the the grocery store
6356,A,Right.
6357,B,and you'd get our money back
6358,B,"and that, that was all well and good."
6359,B,They don't seem to still be doing that.
6360,B,"If they could just eliminate the cans and use glass,"
6361,B,"but, I guess this day and age they don't."
6362,A,Yeah.
6363,A,They don't do that.
6364,A,We live next to a set of railroad tracks
6365,A,"and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there, by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash, you know break them,"
6366,B,Uh-huh.
6367,A,"but, uh, they weren't that successful,"
6368,A,so there were a lot of bottles to be returned
6369,A,and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day
6370,B,Uh-huh.
6371,A,"and,"
6372,B,"Yeah,"
6373,B,"and they, uh,"
6374,B,"I, I think kids don't appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,"
6375,B,they can get more somewhere else.
6376,A,"Yeah,"
6377,A,just a little bit of begging will
6378,B,"Uh, for a good,"
6379,B,right.
6380,B,"They're,"
6381,B,"the nickels, the dimes or what, I suppose it might be quarters, fifty cent pieces in these days, that they would get, they, the kids just don't seem to, to care that, that much about a small amount of money."
6382,A,Right.
6383,A,"Well, I wonder,"
6384,B,"But, we, we did buy a can crusher"
6385,B,and we are crushing cans
6386,B,"and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents,"
6387,B,"so I would say in the last three years, we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before."
6388,A,Yeah.
6389,B,"Uh, it was just easier to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat."
6390,A,"Right,"
6391,A,yeah.
6392,B,"So that's the main reason we're, we, sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles"
6393,A,Where do you take your cans?
6394,B,"Well, as you say, it takes a while to build it up."
6395,B,"Since we've had the crusher all summer, we I guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't oh,"
6396,B,"I think the kids, when we were on vacation, they said they did take them to a, a recycling place, probably at one of the"
6397,A,"Hello, Lynn."
6398,B,Yes.
6399,A,Okay.
6400,A,Do you have any pets?
6401,B,"Yes,"
6402,B,I have a dog and cat now.
6403,A,"Oh, what are their names?"
6404,B,Tibby and Liberty.
6405,A,Which is the dog and which is the cat?
6406,B,Tibby is the dog
6407,B,and Liberty is the cat.
6408,A,"Uh, wife and I, we have, we have two cats."
6409,B,Oh.
6410,A,"Uh, one's real nice,"
6411,A,"but the other one is a, well,"
6412,A,she's pretty wild.
6413,B,Oh Ours are pretty calm.
6414,A,"Yeah,"
6415,A,"are they, um, just house pets?"
6416,B,Uh-huh.
6417,A,"Yeah,"
6418,A,"that's, that's what ours are too."
6419,B,Yeah.
6420,B,Our cat we got from the pound the day the night she was going to be put to sleep.
6421,B,So that's why we call her Liberty.
6422,A,"Oh, really."
6423,A,"Oh, well, that's a nice, nice story. Um."
6424,B,Do you want to hear about my other animals I've had?
6425,A,"Sure,"
6426,A,sure.
6427,B,I've had a skunk
6428,A,Yeah.
6429,B,"I've had a Burmese python,"
6430,B,"I've had rats,"
6431,B,I've had mice
6432,A,Wow.
6433,B,"uh, let's see,"
6434,B,"I've had gerbils,"
6435,B,"I have, I had a son, he's now gone from the home, that was an animal lover."
6436,A,Uh-huh.
6437,B,"So at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house."
6438,A,Wow.
6439,A,"Um, do the skunk, uh, was it kind of like a cat to have around the house?"
6440,B,Yes
6441,A,Yeah.
6442,B,it was litter trained
6443,A,Yeah.
6444,B,and we had it perfumed
6445,A,Uh-huh.
6446,B,"and, uh, it was very aggressive."
6447,A,Right.
6448,B,"But all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house."
6449,A,"Uh-huh,"
6450,A,and the skunk.
6451,B,"And the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa."
6452,A,"Oh, yeah."
6453,A,Um.
6454,B,Nobody came near it when he was there.
6455,A,Oh.
6456,A,"Uh, I had, I had a dog one time,"
6457,A,"and, uh, he chased after a, after a skunk and got sprayed"
6458,B,Oh.
6459,A,"so we had to, we had to give him a tomato, tomato juice bath, and, uh, get him cleaned up,"
6460,B,"Yeah,"
6461,B,"they um, ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them,"
6462,B,but the glands had been removed
6463,A,Uh-huh.
6464,B,"so,"
6465,A,"Right,"
6466,A,but I suppose it was still in the instinct of them to to back up and get ready.
6467,B,Right.
6468,A,"Yeah,"
6469,A,"why, I don't know,"
6470,A,"I, I think they're kind of nice to have,"
6471,A,"they're kind of, you know, just relaxing to, I don't know, to pet and to,"
6472,A,"I don't know,"
6473,A,"when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that, just kind of enjoyable to, you know, have like,"
6474,A,"I don't know,"
6475,A,something giving you some affection as well.
6476,B,"Yeah,"
6477,B,"I always said if I Well, I always said if I died I'd come back as a dog"
6478,A,"What, what do you think?"
6479,A,"Oh, yeah."
6480,A,Yeah.
6481,B,That'd be the best way to be.
6482,A,Yeah.
6483,A,"Um, do you like big dogs or or little dogs?"
6484,B,Well we had a German Shepherd
6485,B,and he had dysplasia
6486,A,Uh-huh.
6487,B,and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went.
6488,A,Really.
6489,B,"So, when he died, we got a little one."
6490,A,Yeah.
6491,B,"But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old,"
6492,B,"and it just, you know, was almost cruel because,"
6493,A,Uh-huh
6494,A,"almost cruel for him to, to walk."
6495,B,"Yeah,"
6496,B,"he just, he couldn't get up,"
6497,B,"he couldn't walk,"
6498,B,"so, he was a hundred and twenty pounds,"
6499,B,so it was a chore.
6500,A,"Wow, yeah."
6501,B,"So we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened, it would be easier to carry."
6502,A,Sure.
6503,A,Yeah.
6504,B,"And then we've had three cats in our married life,"
6505,B,and we've got a calico now.
6506,A,"Yeah,"
6507,A,we've got a calico cat too.
6508,B,Do you?
6509,A,"Yeah,"
6510,A,"yeah,"
6511,A,"she's the, she's the nice one."
6512,A,"We, uh, we used to live in an apartment"
6513,A,"and like, our cats never went outside,"
6514,A,"but, um, the neighbors used to let their dogs out,"
6515,A,"and our neighbors were, I don't know, kind of slimy,"
6516,A,"and, uh, our cats wound up getting fleas, uh, from the apartment that we were in"
6517,B,Um.
6518,A,"so, we had to, we had to flea bath them"
6519,A,"and it was, uh, it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all."
6520,B,"Yeah,"
6521,B,"well, don't even talk to me,"
6522,B,"I, when I was single I had gone away for the weekend,"
6523,A,Yeah.
6524,B,"and my husband, then fianc3e, was to keep my cat,"
6525,B,"and he let her out,"
6526,B,"and my house was loaded with fleas,"
6527,B,"I mean, you walked in"
6528,B,and your legs were just black.
6529,A,Really.
6530,B,"And we had such a time, and never got the cat back."
6531,A,Really.
6532,B,"Yeah,"
6533,B,"I found it, you know, in the street."
6534,A,Oh.
6535,B,"I was a social worker at the time, and found it,"
6536,B,Now is it Stacy?
6537,A,Angie.
6538,B,"Angie,"
6539,B,I'm sorry.
6540,A,Okay.
6541,B,"Well, now, so if you were going to have a dinner party, what would you make?"
6542,A,"Um, let's see,"
6543,A,"uh, I like seafood."
6544,A,"Uh, let's see,"
6545,A,"uh, shrimp, steamed uh, shellfish with maybe herbs."
6546,A,"Uh, spicy lobster with linguini."
6547,B,That sounds good.
6548,A,Yeah.
6549,B,"Now what is, uh, what is, uh, the steamed shellfish you said?"
6550,A,Uh-huh.
6551,B,"And what would that be like, a clam or, uh,"
6552,A,Right.
6553,B,Okay.
6554,A,Yeah.
6555,A,"Uh, I think hors d'oeuvres are good, too."
6556,A,"Uh, and that way, you can have a variety. Uh,"
6557,B,"So if you have a, a dinner party and you're going to serve, uh, seafood for supper, what type of, uh, hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal?"
6558,A,"Uh,"
6559,B,"Like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or,"
6560,A,"Yeah,"
6561,A,fresh vegetables would be good
6562,A,"or, uh, just,"
6563,B,"Probably not nachos and dip, huh?"
6564,A,No.
6565,B,"And would you, uh, would it be appropriate to, uh, drink with the, uh, prior, when you have the hors d'oeuvres?"
6566,A,"Yeah,"
6567,A,yeah.
6568,B,Okay.
6569,B,"And then when you serve the meal, what type of wine would you have with, uh, with the, with seafood?"
6570,A,"Oh, all these hard questions"
6571,A,"Uh, what, white wine?"
6572,B,That would be my guess.
6573,A,Yeah.
6574,B,"And, And then, uh, uh, dessert."
6575,A,"I'm not really a drinker,"
6576,A,"so I'm not, I don't know a lot about that."
6577,B,Something sweet?
6578,A,"Oh, goodness."
6579,A,"Uh, chocolate, something chocolate."
6580,A,Uh
6581,B,You must like chocolate.
6582,A,Yes.
6583,B,"Well, let's see."
6584,B,"Usually when we have a dinner party, I always, I like to grill."
6585,A,"Oh, you do?"
6586,B,"So, we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese."
6587,B,"One of our favorites is, uh, to take some, let's see Philadelphia cream cheese I think, is that what comes in  those little blocks?  And pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and, uh, wash them and cool them and then dump them in the, uh, sauce and then take crackers"
6588,A,Uh-huh.
6589,A,Yeah.
6590,B,and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese
6591,B,and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail.
6592,B,"And then I like to barbecue, like steaks or pork chops."
6593,B,"And then we have, uh, oh, lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them and a salad"
6594,A,Uh-huh.
6595,B,"and then, uh, I don't know what we usually have for dessert."
6596,B,"Cake sometimes,"
6597,B,"but, uh, that's what we would do for a dinner party, I guess."
6598,A,"That sounds good, too."
6599,B,"But that's, I guess when you talk about dinner party, that's probably not, uh, that's more for like when friends come over."
6600,A,Traditional
6601,A,right?
6602,B,"Traditional,"
6603,B,yeah.
6604,A,Yeah.
6605,B,"I wouldn't be the big, uh, snotty kind."
6606,A,"I just started, I just really started, uh, uh, learning about that"
6607,A,"and I bought a Martha Stewart,"
6608,A,I don't know if you've heard of her.
6609,B,Huh-uh.
6610,A,Her cookbook
6611,A,"and she talks about catering and, uh, you know, goes into, goes into all that and the different types of, uh, uh, different types of parties, you know, different types of foods."
6612,B,"Oh, well, do you work in a, uh, in a setting where you, uh, are in the food business?"
6613,A,"Um, my father owns a restaurant."
6614,B,"Oh, in, uh, Is it in Dallas?"
6615,A,"It's, it's just a, uh, a cafe,"
6616,A,"so it's not really anything, you know, that I want to,"
6617,A,it's not the same
6618,A,"Uh, it's in Lewisville."
6619,B,"Okay,"
6620,B,all right.
6621,B,So you graduated from which high school?
6622,A,Trinity.
6623,B,"Trinity,"
6624,B,okay.
6625,B,And that's a public school or private?
6626,A,That's public.
6627,B,"Huh, okay,"
6628,B,"I have to get to know this area a little better, I guess."
6629,B,"Uh, well, is your father's cafe, uh, one that you could cater out of?"
6630,A,"No,"
6631,A,"uh-huh, *listen; mistranscription of 'uh-uh'?"
6632,A,it's not.
6633,B,"Um, and he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably."
6634,A,Uh.
6635,B,"Well, let's see,"
6636,B,"what else for catering. Uh,"
6637,A,"Let's see,"
6638,A,what about Hawaiian luau.
6639,B,"Oh, that would be good."
6640,A,"Could have, uh, uh, fruits and, and pineapple, uh,"
6641,A,"let's see, uh,"
6642,B,"And you could actually go with, uh, a chicken if you wanted to."
6643,A,"I think, I think decorating your food is, you know, really,"
6644,A,"Uh, we have a Sheltie Collie, a miniature Sheltie."
6645,B,Do you?
6646,A,Yeah.
6647,A,"It's about, oh, about six months old,"
6648,A,and we're
6649,A,"we live in an apartment,"
6650,A,"so, we don't have a yard,"
6651,A,so it has to stay inside
6652,A,and we're having a difficult time trying to train it.
6653,B,How old is it?
6654,A,It's about six months.
6655,B,"Uh, you, you're, you're in the roughest stages of pet  ownership, I think."
6656,A,Really?
6657,A,"But they're supposed to be real intelligent dogs,"
6658,A,"but I guess every one, one one, one of them, or every once in a while, you get one that's not so intelligent because this one, it."
6659,B,"Well. I don't, I don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence, really, the, the, the training bit, uh."
6660,B,I've had dogs through the years.
6661,B,"Right now I've got two, and three cats,"
6662,B,"but, uh, and my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a Sheltie mix,"
6663,B,"and we watched it this summer for two to three months,"
6664,B,and it wasn't trained quite fully either
6665,A,Uh-huh.
6666,B,"and, uh, but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog."
6667,A,"Yeah,"
6668,A,"so how'd you all, how do you,"
6669,A,what's the best method?
6670,B,I don't know.
6671,B,"I, I'm old fashioned,"
6672,B,"and when I got my, my dogs, when they, when they did something I hollered at them and threw them outside."
6673,A,Right.
6674,B,They say that's not the way to do it now.
6675,B,You're just supposed to
6676,A,Stand outside with them until they.
6677,B,"No,"
6678,B,"just, just, put them outside, I guess. Unless you catch them in the act."
6679,A,"Well, we're hardly ever at home,"
6680,A,"so it's kind of difficult,"
6681,B,Yeah.
6682,A,"and, you know, you don't want to, you don't want to spank it or scare it, or anything like that,"
6683,A,so.
6684,B,"No,"
6685,B,"no,"
6686,B,"you don't want to do that,"
6687,B,"but, uh."
6688,A,"Yeah,"
6689,A,"we, we try to take it, you know,"
6690,A,"it gets, it gets frustrating when you take it outside"
6691,A,"and, you know  and then it runs right inside"
6692,B,"Does, does it just want to sniff around?"
6693,B,Does it just want to sniff around and play when it's outside?
6694,A,"Yeah,"
6695,A,"a lot of times,"
6696,A,"and you know, it won't it's little job outside"
6697,B,Yeah.
6698,A,and it comes inside.
6699,B,Have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside?
6700,A,"Uh, yeah,"
6701,A,"we've tried that,"
6702,A,"and, uh, you know, there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go,"
6703,B,Yeah.
6704,A,"so, and he chews on plants and all that,"
6705,A,"but, you know, that's natural  for a little puppy. Huh?"
6706,B,"That's nothing, huh."
6707,B,"Well, it, it, it'll, it'll catch on pretty soon, I'll, I'll bet you."
6708,B,"I, I have a sixteen year old, almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever,"
6709,B,"and she's gone the other way,"
6710,B,"because she's so old, she doesn't have much control"
6711,A,"Oh, really."
6712,B,so we're battling with that problem
6713,A,"Oh, that's sad."
6714,B,and she still feels good.
6715,B,"Uh, she can't hear worth a darn or see very well,"
6716,B,"but she's got a great appetite,"
6717,B,"and she knows we're there, by smell."
6718,A,How old is it?
6719,B,She'll be sixteen in May.
6720,A,Man that's sad.
6721,B,"And yeah,"
6722,B,"but we can't bear to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years,"
6723,A,"Oh, of course not."
6724,B,"so we're putting up with all her accidents,"
6725,A,I couldn't.
6726,B,and the
6727,B,"two nights ago, she had diarrhea,"
6728,B,and so that was a bad one.
6729,B,"But, uh, I think we're buying a carpet shampooer this weekend"
6730,A,That is really sad.
6731,A,"What, what's the deal,"
6732,A,"we, we try to, we're trying to take it on walks now, you know"
6733,B,Uh-huh.
6734,A,and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash
6735,B,Yeah.
6736,A,"and so it, I mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to, you know, tug on it to walk it."
6737,A,"I mean, it just goes like a mad dog,"
6738,A,"I mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping,"
6739,A,"and  it's, you know, I mean, it's not even close to even being trained on a leash."
6740,B,"Does it, oh."
6741,B,Uh-huh.
6742,B,"You know, maybe you you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes."
6743,A,Uh-huh.
6744,A,"Well, we've heard bad, we've heard some bad things about some of those, you know,"
6745,A,"they sometimes misuse their license or whatever you know,"
6746,B,Oh.
6747,A,they treat them bad.
6748,B,"Well, you know, we went, we went to the junior college, Richland"
6749,A,"Oh, really?"
6750,B,"and we took,"
6751,B,"my, my daughter was living at home then,"
6752,B,"and she took our Golden Retriever, oh, not the Golden Retriever, the Norwegian Elk Hound over there"
6753,A,"Oh, really?"
6754,B,"and, it, it, it's a pretty good class,"
6755,B,"and they did pretty good, except this dog is,"
6756,B,"she's just pretty,"
6757,B,she's not smart
6758,A,Uh-huh.
6759,B,"So, she didn't learn a lot,"
6760,B,"but it, I think it calmed her down a little bit,"
6761,B,and she's used to being around other dogs now.
6762,A,How long did it take?
6763,B,I think it was like a six week program.
6764,A,"Every, what?"
6765,B,"Uh, I think it was one night a week for like six weeks,"
6766,A,"Oh, really?"
6767,B,"and, uh, you know, it was a group class, outside."
6768,B,"It was fairly reasonable, too."
6769,A,"Well, Sheltie Collies are, you know, timid,"
6770,A,"and they don't really,"
6771,A,"unless they get used to something, they're really nervous"
6772,A,and.
6773,B,"Yeah,"
6774,B,"they're, they're usually, a high-strung dog aren't they?"
6775,A,"Yeah,"
6776,A,"yeah,"
6777,A,"and, uh, if they're not accustomed to something, they, they're really scared."
6778,A,So.
6779,B,"Um, our, our friend has a,"
6780,A,"Okay,"
6781,A,"um, I guess we're going to talk, describe, uh, job benefits,"
6782,A,"and so what do you think, next to salary do you rank, is the most important job benefits?"
6783,B,"Uh, I would say the medical, uh, group insurance area as far as, uh, covering medical costs for yourself or family members."
6784,A,Uh-huh.
6785,A,Uh-huh.
6786,A,"Well, um, does your company have good benefits in that, in that regard?"
6787,B,"Yeah,"
6788,B,"I think,"
6789,B,"I work for a public school system, district"
6790,A,Uh-huh.
6791,B,"and, uh, so it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing,"
6792,B,"where the school district does, um, the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of, uh, costs."
6793,A,"Oh, yeah."
6794,B,"But overall, um, I've been pleased with it over the years."
6795,A,Uh-huh.
6796,B,"I think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year, our district has had to alter, uh, you know, change companies,"
6797,B,"or now we're on a managed care thing, which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any."
6798,A,Uh-huh.
6799,A,I see.
6800,B,How about yourself?
6801,A,"Uh, well I'm,"
6802,A,my medical coverage is with an H M O
6803,B,Uh-huh.
6804,A,"um, so, that's, in my opinion, that's that's bordering on a health clinic,"
6805,A,but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage.
6806,B,"Right,"
6807,B,yeah.
6808,A,Um.
6809,B,"Our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety school year, or calendar years,"
6810,B,"and I was in the H M O,"
6811,B,"and, um, I was because my, my same doctor, you know, agreed to be in it for, uh,"
6812,B,they usually sign a contract or something
6813,A,Uh-huh.
6814,B,"and, um, uh, I did have surgery last summer"
6815,B,"and I paid ten dollars when I went to see him that first day,"
6816,B,"and I've never seen another bill,"
6817,B,so I I have to say it really works.
6818,A,Right.
6819,B,"But, again, I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it."
6820,B,"Uh, if you've been going to a doctor for, you know, ten years or something and he elects not to join, it can be very stressful for you know, those people."
6821,A,Yes.
6822,A,"That's right,"
6823,A,"yeah,"
6824,A,"I'm, I'm fairly young myself,"
6825,A,"I've only been,"
6826,A,"when I first started working which,"
6827,A,three years ago is when I first got into full time employment
6828,B,Uh-huh.
6829,A,"and, uh, at that time I immediately joined the H M O,"
6830,A,"and I never really,"
6831,A,"so the only doctor I, I've kind of consistently had has been through the H M O,"
6832,A,"and, uh you know, for me it's worked out real good."
6833,B,Yeah.
6834,B,"Right,"
6835,B,"but if you, you know, have a family and, and, um, everybody's gone to different doctors, uh, it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your, just has, you know, all the medical history"
6836,B,and you feel comfortable with it.
6837,A,Uh-huh.
6838,B,"I, I'm sure it would be very stressful"
6839,B,"and, my husband and I have just elected that if that happens, I will go and just pay."
6840,B,You can continue to go to your own doctor
6841,A,Uh-huh.
6842,B,"but your benefits are not as, you know, good,"
6843,B,"so, uh."
6844,A,Uh-huh.
6845,A,"Yeah,"
6846,A,"um, like you, you mentioned you work for a school system."
6847,A,"I work for, uh, Georgia Tech in the  research branch,"
6848,B,"Oh, all right."
6849,A,"and I guess another one that, that I rank up there high is the, uh, kind of job flexibility and time off, um, I enjoy as a benefit."
6850,B,I do too.
6851,B,Are you talking about like Spring Break
6852,B,"and,"
6853,A,Right
6854,B,Right.
6855,A,"yeah,"
6856,A,"getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that, and having a lot of vacation."
6857,B,Right.
6858,B,"It, it really, um,"
6859,B,"I don't think most of our teachers,"
6860,B,"now I'm not a teacher,"
6861,B,"I am a secretarial executive assistant,"
6862,B,"but I don't think the teachers could stand the stress all, all year long frankly."
6863,A,Uh-huh.
6864,B,"It is just, Texas has really, um, you know,"
6865,B,"they want everybody educated, no matter what it costs,"
6866,B,"uh, and it, it would be just,"
6867,B,"we all look forward to,"
6868,B,"like in two weeks we have Spring Break,"
6869,B,"and I don't know who looks forward to it more, the students or the teachers and the staff."
6870,A,Uh-huh.
6871,A,Right.
6872,B,What do you do there?
6873,A,"Well, um, I'm not actually on the teaching faculty,"
6874,A,"but we have a large research organization associated with the university,"
6875,A,and that's who I work with.
6876,B,Okay.
6877,A,"Um, and we're given, you know, a good bit of flexibility in what we do."
6878,A,We can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study.
6879,B,"Well, that's good."
6880,B,"Yeah,"
6881,B,"I would think that that type of employment, you're, you're, one day you might be really tuned in and the next day, oh, a little luke warm or something"
6882,A,Right.
6883,B,"and, um, it's good that they allow you that."
6884,A,Right.
6885,B,"It, um,"
6886,B,"as I say, the schools,"
6887,B,"now we do have to work, you know, the day,"
6888,B,"but we do get many days off,"
6889,B,"and, uh, we all look forward to it."
6890,A,Uh-huh.
6891,B,"That's the only reason I work there, is that my children now have graduated, and graduated from college"
6892,B,"but at the  time, I worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs"
6893,A,"Oh, yeah."
6894,A,Uh-huh.
6895,B,"and, uh, I've just continued to, uh, stay there"
6896,A,"Are there, are there any things that, that you'd like to see changed in terms of the, the benefits?"
6897,A,"Okay,"
6898,A,"I guess it took,"
6899,A,so I guess the recording has started now.
6900,B,Yeah.
6901,A,Uh.
6902,B,"So, have you ever served on a jury?"
6903,A,"I served,"
6904,A,"I was in the Air Force, and served on a court martial, uh, board a couple of times, which is very similar to a jury."
6905,A,A lot of the same rules apply.
6906,A,Have you ever served on one?
6907,B,"Yeah,"
6908,B,I finally served on one last year.
6909,B,"I've, um, been voting for years,"
6910,B,and I couldn't figure out why I hadn't been called yet
6911,A,Uh-huh.
6912,B,and I finally was.
6913,B,So it was an interesting experience.
6914,B,"I was kind of boring. *listen; should I be ""it"""
6915,A,Was it civil or criminal?
6916,B,"Uh, it was, uh uh, it was, uh, well, let's see, it was municipal court"
6917,A,"A grand jury or,"
6918,A,Uh-huh.
6919,B,"so it was a combination of, uh,"
6920,B,and I was in the pool for a couple of weeks
6921,A,I see.
6922,B,"so it was a combination of criminal and civil,"
6923,B,"and they had, uh,"
6924,B,"well most of the time we, we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors"
6925,A,Uh-huh.
6926,B,"and then, it was always exciting when we got called to, to, to go, because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides, uh, just sit in the jury room."
6927,A,Uh-huh.
6928,A,"Uh, did, did the judge, uh, hand down sentences"
6929,A,or did you folks do that?
6930,B,"Uh, yeah,"
6931,B,the judge did.
6932,B,"Uh, I, uh, I had a hard time getting seated on a jury."
6933,B,"I kept getting, uh,"
6934,B,"I'd be questioned, uh, for empaneling the jury,"
6935,B,"and they kept, uh, dismissing me."
6936,A,Uh-huh.
6937,A,Um.
6938,B,"Course they don't have to give a reason,"
6939,B,"but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like, you know,"
6940,A,No.
6941,B,"they want to get the best, uh, mix for their case,"
6942,B,so they ask all kinds of wild questions.
6943,A,That that's a science in itself.
6944,B,"Yeah,"
6945,B,"well I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions,"
6946,B,"and I think part of it was they didn't, uh, they didn't like the fact that I don't drink any more."
6947,B,So.
6948,A,"Uh-huh,"
6949,A,I see.
6950,A,"Because you'd probably be, uh, too puritanical"
6951,A,and
6952,B,"Yeah,"
6953,B,"that was probably it,"
6954,B,"although in my case I might have been more, uh, sympathetic with the person who got caught,"
6955,B,I don't know.
6956,A,Uh-huh.
6957,A,"So, uh, were, were the, uh, sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair,"
6958,A,"or would,"
6959,A,"if you were deciding, do you think that they would have been different."
6960,B,"Well, I was never there, never there for any sentencing."
6961,B,"Uh, I finally got empaneled on one case, uh, on my next to the last day,"
6962,B,"and, uh, we got into the, uh, jury room to, uh, decide the case,"
6963,B,"and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate, because he'd already decided that the guy was, uh, not guilty,"
6964,B,and he would never vote for guilty.
6965,A,Huh.
6966,B,"So, uh, they appointed me jury, jury foreman"
6967,B,"and I, uh, didn't think that, uh, going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict,"
6968,B,"so I told the judge that we weren't, were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate."
6969,A,Um.
6970,B,So the whole thing had to be tried over again.
6971,A,"Wow,"
6972,A,I bet that made him happy.
6973,B,Yeah.
6974,B,"Yeah,"
6975,B,"it was, uh, it was funny."
6976,B,"The, uh,"
6977,B,"I I, I don't know,"
6978,B,"I, uh, I didn't, uh, uh, I didn't like not being able to deliberate."
6979,A,Right.
6980,B,"I, uh, I, I wanted to vote guilty for the guy,"
6981,B,and the other people were kind of mixed
6982,A,Uh-huh.
6983,B,"so, uh, the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again."
6984,B,"Cost him a lot of money,"
6985,B,I'm sure.
6986,A,Yeah.
6987,A,"Oh, how many members were on the jury?"
6988,A,Was it a six or twelve member jury?
6989,B,"Uh, it must have been six."
6990,A,Uh-huh.
6991,B,Yeah.
6992,A,That's kind of curious to me.
6993,A,"I didn't realize until the, uh, Wayne Kennedy Smith trial, uh, a few months ago that they had six member juries."
6994,A,"I thought that they, you know, it was always twelve, twelve men tried and true, so to speak."
6995,B,Um.
6996,A,"But, uh, apparently for some, some crimes, it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment."
6997,B,Um.
6998,A,I know on a
6999,A,"getting to this unanimous thing, whether, you know, a jury should be unanimous or not, or not, in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous."
7000,A,"It's a simple majority, you know, rules."
7001,B,Yeah.
7002,B,"Well, let's  see,"
7003,B,"is it on, uh, capital crimes that they have to be unanimous"
7004,B,"and,"
7005,A,"Probably on capital,"
7006,A,"I don't know,"
7007,A,"we weren't, we, we,"
7008,A,the two that I were on had to do with drugs
7009,B,Uh-huh.
7010,A,"and, uh, we were, uh, unanimous is acquitting the person, even though we in our, in our, uh, gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends, because of various things,"
7011,A,"the government really failed to prove its case,"
7012,A,"and, you know, being fair to the person, if the government doesn't prove its case, no matter how you feel, you have to go by what's offered as proof,"
7013,A,and we had to acquit him in both cases.
7014,B,"Uh, it was too circumstantial?"
7015,A,"Uh, yeah,"
7016,A,"it was, yeah, in some of the critical things, like the special investigations, at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person,"
7017,A,but something happened to the camera and the tape and
7018,B,Um.
7019,A,"all they could do was testify,"
7020,A,Do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore?
7021,B,That's a good question.
7022,B,"Uh, there would be a point, there was a point where I would have said, no, that no one would deserve to die for, for a crime that he committed."
7023,B,"But, uh, since I've become a parent and since I've seen, uh, things like Jeffrey I really have to question that."
7024,B,"I really, uh, I, I can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people."
7025,A,Uh-huh.
7026,B,"And, uh, try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment."
7027,B,"Uh,"
7028,A,"Of the statements made by people against the, the death penalty, um, I, I like the statement made by Cuomo."
7029,A,"Cuomo I believe is,"
7030,A,"um, he's, he's governor of New York"
7031,A,"but, uh, he's, uh, against the death penalty."
7032,A,"But, um, he said that he would, he would want to, to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if, if they did something to his wife."
7033,A,"And that's,"
7034,A,"but, but, even, even in that in that, uh, uh, situation he would he would hope that there would be people around him who would, uh, keep him from doing the, doing the things."
7035,B,"Oh, it's a, uh, it's a question of your, your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response."
7036,A,"Right,"
7037,A,exactly.
7038,B,"Uh, and that was the thing that, uh, killed Dukakis back, uh, four years ago when someone asked him a similar question"
7039,B,"and he, he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when, uh, people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion uh, a gut level reaction."
7040,A,Uh-huh.
7041,B,And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level.
7042,B,"Uh, you know, whether it be a biblical force, uh, you know, the eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a knife, life type logic or just, uh, uh, some sort of anger at putting putting, uh, murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life, uh, while we foot the bill."
7043,A,Yeah.
7044,B,"I think people are, are working at that from more of a, uh, a gut reaction than a, a reason humane one."
7045,A,"See, I don't think the decisions that are going to be made on on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do."
7046,A,"Are they reformatories, where we're trying to take people who can't survive or, or that, that aren't conforming enough to society so that, that we work well together."
7047,A,"Or are they,"
7048,A,is it a penal institution?
7049,A,"Is it, is, is it designed for punishment?"
7050,A,"Um, the death penalty surely fits in well with, uh, in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment."
7051,A,"Uh, perhaps not in the manner that we do it"
7052,A,"but, but it, in, in theory it fits in."
7053,A,"In system, in a reformatory, I mean"
7054,A,"if you, if you put someone to death you obviously, can't reform them."
7055,B,That's true.
7056,A,So.
7057,B,"Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent"
7058,B,"and I really don't, uh, agree with that."
7059,B,"I don't think anyone who would commit a, uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person"
7060,B,"but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me"
7061,B,so I better not do it.
7062,B,"I, I just,  don't think that, uh, that it works that way."
7063,A,Yeah.
7064,A,I don't think it's done.
7065,A,I don't think we run it as a deterrent.
7066,A,"I mean people say that,"
7067,A,"but, I mean, if it was really a deterrent, I mean I think like horse thieves in the old west, you know,"
7068,A,they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while.
7069,B,Uh-huh.
7070,A,"And if we really if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent, I would think that it would be public."
7071,A,"I mean I don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever, nobody ever sees it."
7072,A,"If someone ever,"
7073,A,"if, you know,"
7074,A,"like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime, had to sit and watch and, and see a guy burn or, or, you know, something or shot by a firing squad or something like that."
7075,A,"I would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than, you know, telling them that there's, there's protestors out here at the, you know."
7076,B,"Well, I, I don't know if that would really work that way or not."
7077,B,"Uh, there's a lot of violence,"
7078,A,"Um, are you working right now?"
7079,B,"Uh, yes,"
7080,B,I am.
7081,B,"I'm working in the computer science department here uh, at C M U."
7082,A,"Uh,"
7083,A,"What kind of, what kind of work do you do?"
7084,B,"Uh, I'm doing basically system, system design work and, uh, implementation work for the speech, for the speech group uh, here."
7085,A,Uh-huh.
7086,A,Oh.
7087,A,is that how you heard about this thing?
7088,B,"Yeah,"
7089,A,"Uh,"
7090,B,actually through electronic mail.
7091,A,Uh-huh.
7092,A,Me too.
7093,A,"I work at, uh, the Georgia Tech Research Institute."
7094,B,Uh-huh.
7095,A,"Um, I'm a co-op student"
7096,A,so I work and go to school about halftime.
7097,A,"And, uh, I really don't have any job benefits to speak of."
7098,A,"We're kind of, um,"
7099,A,"I don't know,"
7100,A,they just kind of forget us on that end.
7101,A,"We don't really have any vacation or, you know, sick days or health care or anything really"
7102,A,so.
7103,B,Right.
7104,B,"So it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away,  at, at this point"
7105,A,Exactly.
7106,A,Exactly.
7107,B,Yeah.
7108,A,What about you?
7109,B,"Well, um, I'm research stuff here now"
7110,B,"so what they, they have, uh, um, okay, benefits package."
7111,B,It's not quite as good as industry
7112,B,"but one of the significant, um, benefits here is that you can take, uh, up to two courses a semester, um,"
7113,B,"and they pay for you know, pay for the classes."
7114,A,Huh.
7115,B,"So,  that works out to be, um, a reasonable, a reasonable benefit."
7116,A,Yeah.
7117,A,"Uh, they do that I think if you're, uh, research here"
7118,A,then I know of some of the people that have gotten their masters
7119,A,"and I think that, um, they might, you know, pay for that.  Pay for the classes and stuff"
7120,B,Uh-huh.
7121,A,"but I know they let you, they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage."
7122,A,"You know, they'll let you work halftime if you want to, if you want to finish,"
7123,B,"If you want to,  do it quickly."
7124,A,"you want to,"
7125,A,Yeah.
7126,A,"They'll let you work, decrease your number of hours by any percentage just, just about so if you want to get your masters"
7127,A,"and then, I think of course you get like a, with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due"
7128,A,so that will probably help out.
7129,B,"Uh-huh,"
7130,B,uh-huh.
7131,B,Yeah.
7132,B,Yeah.
7133,B,"So I, I don't know in, in terms of other things, other benefits other than sort of monetary"
7134,B,"I'd, you know, I,"
7135,B,"Yeah,"
7136,B,"we, we do."
7137,B,"We have to contribute a certain amount, uh, to it."
7138,A,Uh-huh.
7139,B,"And it's kind of split between C M U and,  and, you know, the employee."
7140,A,Yeah.
7141,A,"Yeah,"
7142,A,"I think, I mean that's pretty, that's a pretty important, uh, part of it there because that, that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems."
7143,A,"My dad, I think my,"
7144,A,"I'm still covered on, with my dad's, uh, health plan at his, where he works,"
7145,A,but it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own.
7146,B,Right.
7147,B,"Yeah,"
7148,B,"and it's also, right now it's, uh, the,"
7149,B,"like everywhere else, uh,"
7150,B,"here in Pittsburgh the health care, uh, rates are, are going up pretty quickly."
7151,A,Uh-huh.
7152,B,That's a whole other topic to begin with too
7153,B,but.
7154,B,"Yeah,"
7155,B,"but it's, you are right."
7156,B,"I, I, I really agree that, that that's pretty important."
7157,A,"the I think the, I guess the only real, um, benefit I guess you could say working, for me working here, besides I mean"
7158,A,"I'm learning and stuff because,  I'm at, you know, in school."
7159,B,Right.
7160,A,"But there's, there's some where, uh, uh, student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax. that's about, five percent right there"
7161,B,Right.
7162,B,Uh-huh
7163,B,Oh
7164,B,Now that's a big win.
7165,A,so.
7166,B,"Yeah,"
7167,B,yeah.
7168,B,"That's,"
7169,A,That's about the only real bonus
7170,B,Yeah.
7171,A,"I have, so I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid you know, because if I was working somewhere else I'd have to, you know, pay an extra five percent,  or so."
7172,B,Yeah.
7173,B,I figured for
7174,B,"and they've just raised the, um, income caps on Social Security to the point where you have to be pretty, you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying paying that as well."
7175,A,Huh.
7176,A,Yeah.
7177,B,"Yeah,"
7178,B,"well if you could call it a benefit that C M U, I mean"
7179,B,"the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is, is consult for, um, you know, other companies."
7180,A,"Oh, yeah?"
7181,B,"Um, so that's, that kind of helps out in terms of,  you know, keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry."
7182,A,Uh-huh.
7183,A,Yeah.
7184,B,"You know, in case,  you know, in case you ever need to bail out"
7185,A,help a lot.
7186,A,Yeah.
7187,A,"See around, around here it's like, uh,"
7188,A,"we pretty much work from project to project on, well, you know, with different sponsors."
7189,B,Uh-huh.
7190,A,"There's not, there is not a whole lot of, you know, funded research from,"
7191,A,Type of music is hot down in Texas?
7192,B,"Uh, well, I don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas."
7193,B,"I know what's hot down here with me,"
7194,B,"so that's about all I can feel apt to discuss with you since I just know,"
7195,B,I don't ever listen to the radio
7196,B,and that's usually what's hot around here
7197,B,"so, So, what kind of music do you like?"
7198,A,"Oh, okay."
7199,A,"Uh, mostly folk music."
7200,B,Folk music.
7201,A,"Yeah,"
7202,A,"I find myself, uh, listening to a lot of, uh, uh, either old timer or New England, uh, dance bands as well as, uh, just more popular folk music and new artists coming up."
7203,B,Uh-huh.
7204,B,"Well, we're on totally different wavelengths."
7205,A,Okay.
7206,B,"I'm more, uh, old rock and roll, uh, some new, newer, I guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type you know, uh, Van Halen, that kind of thing."
7207,A,Uh-huh.
7208,A,"Yeah,"
7209,A,"what about, uh, classic rock type stations."
7210,B,"Uh, I don't listen to the radio at all."
7211,B,"We live in a fairly small town,"
7212,B,"so uh, classic rock for me is what I have, which is like, uh, Doors, Eagles, Jimmy Hendrix."
7213,A,"Oh, okay."
7214,A,"So, some some of the older Eagles stuff was good."
7215,B,"Uh,"
7216,B,Yeah.
7217,A,"I, I didn't like, uh,"
7218,A,"they started getting a little more, you know,"
7219,A,"the type of music, at least to me, it's, uh, sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes"
7220,A,and I don't like listening at high volumes.
7221,B,Yeah.
7222,B,Yeah.
7223,A,"But, uh, some of their older stuff was, uh, you know, quite enjoyable to me."
7224,B,"Yeah,"
7225,B,"well they,"
7226,A,"You know, Hotel California and that era."
7227,B,"Yeah,"
7228,B,yeah
7229,B,"that does, that's something you don't, doesn't even sound good loud really. You know."
7230,A,Yeah.
7231,B,"You know, definitely."
7232,B,"Uh, so, anything new you like coming out now, other than folk music, some I might know of."
7233,B,I don't know any folk music at all.
7234,A,"Well, down in Texas, uh, you know, little, listen to a little country every now and then."
7235,B,"Yeah,"
7236,B,"oh yeah,"
7237,B,"here,"
7238,A,I'm sure there's a lot of that down there.
7239,B,"Oh, plenty."
7240,B,"Way, way more than I can stand down here."
7241,B,"I, I don't care for it at all, that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it."
7242,B,"I,"
7243,A,"Well, there, there's a Conway Twitty twang,"
7244,A,"then there's the, uh, Dolly Parton, uh, Hollywood sound."
7245,B,"Yeah,"
7246,B,"yeah,"
7247,B,"that's more, even more commercialized for of country music."
7248,A,Yeah.
7249,B,"But, uh, it's getting, uh, uh, getting pretty big everywhere, as I see it."
7250,B,Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses
7251,B,"so,"
7252,A,"Yeah,"
7253,A,"I think some of them, the artists are even, uh, hitting the pop charts."
7254,B,"Yeah,"
7255,B,"it's, it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is."
7256,B,"Concert tours for country and western sings is, it's, it's quite, quite odd,"
7257,B,"but, uh, I don't know,"
7258,B,"it's, music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays, I think."
7259,B,"It's becoming not necessarily good music, just popular music, you know."
7260,A,"Hey,"
7261,A,"I, I, I think most artists are in to make a few bucks."
7262,B,"Yeah,"
7263,B,"and that's all it,"
7264,A,But they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were
7265,B,Yeah.
7266,A,"late, late sixties, early seventies, they were they were definitely pushing a message."
7267,B,"That's what it,"
7268,B,"Yeah,"
7269,B,"that's what, what you say,"
7270,B,"and, and then music is wrapped around now."
7271,B,"Now, it's the other way around."
7272,A,"Yeah,"
7273,A,"I, I don't, I don't think Gun,"
7274,A,"at least to my mind, Guns and Roses doesn't have too much of a message, too much to say."
7275,B,"No,"
7276,B,"no,"
7277,B,they don't have anything really important you want to hear.
7278,B,"But, you know, it's kind of odd,"
7279,B,"it's like, it doesn't have to be good,"
7280,B,"it's just who does it, you know."
7281,A,Uh-huh.
7282,B,"You hear a, you hear a Paula Abdul song"
7283,B,"and you,"
7284,B,"and I think, if somebody else were to play that, you know, they wouldn't, they, nobody, everybody would think, that's lousy,"
7285,B,"but because she did it, it's supposed to be good, you know,"
7286,B,"it comes to the point where it's your name, not what you do more than anything."
7287,A,Right.
7288,B,Madonna can do anything
7289,B,"and it would be considered good because it's Madonna, you know."
7290,A,Right.
7291,B,Madonna could start playing folk music
7292,B,"and folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it,"
7293,B,"so it's, it's, it's really backwards how things are working now"
7294,A,Uh-huh
7295,B,"but,"
7296,A,"Yeah,"
7297,A,"it's the artist, not the merit."
7298,B,"Yeah,"
7299,B,exactly.
7300,B,"So, I don't know, I, I don't know that that's, I don't think that's a good thing at all,"
7301,B,"but that's that's what the, point we've reached,"
7302,B,"so I don't know how how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way, at least."
7303,A,Yeah.
7304,A,"Well, I don't know,"
7305,A,"I know for myself that, uh, for the most part, I don't know which artist is which,"
7306,A,"so I listen to a song,"
7307,A,I either like the song
7308,A,or I don't like it
7309,B,Yeah.
7310,A,"and then if I really like the song, eventually I'll figure out who it was."
7311,B,Yeah.
7312,B,"Yeah,"
7313,B,that's about how I am on popular music.
7314,B,"I don't, you know, you don't, I don't know enough about it because I just listen,"
7315,B,"uh, everything I listen to is what I buy, not whatever they play on the radio"
7316,B,"so,"
7317,A,"Well, you have to figure out what to buy,"
7318,A,or do you just buy along the same artist?
7319,B,"Uh, I,"
7320,B,"yeah,"
7321,B,I just mostly buy along the same lines all the time.
7322,B,I don't really switch around to new things very often.
7323,A,Yeah.
7324,B,"It's just, it's, you know, it's way to hectic and too confusing."
7325,A,"Yeah,"
7326,A,"so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album, then you stop?"
7327,B,"Uh,"
7328,B,"yeah,"
7329,B,"generally,"
7330,B,"or, about the only new music I hear is somebody else that I know will buy something new that I haven't heard"
7331,A,Yeah.
7332,B,"and I listen to it that way,"
7333,B,"but as far as,"
7334,B,"yeah,"
7335,B,I don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless I've heard it.
7336,A,"Yeah,"
7337,A,"see, that's one thing I like about the, uh, some of the folk music scenes, you know,"
7338,A,"there's a couple of nice, uh, small coffee houses up in New Jersey."
7339,B,Yeah.
7340,A,"And, it's very nice,"
7341,A,you go into the coffee house
7342,A,"and, you know, an artist is there"
7343,A,and very often the artist will have a an album
7344,A,"and, so if you like the artist, you buy the album."
7345,B,Yeah.
7346,A,So you definitely get to try before you buy.
7347,B,"Yeah,"
7348,B,"yeah,"
7349,B,that's definitely
7350,B,"I,"
7351,A,"You know, it,"
7352,A,"you, you, you don't always quite get it right,"
7353,A,Okay.
7354,B,"Okay,"
7355,B,you go first.
7356,A,"Well, I have, uh, two kids,"
7357,A,I have one seven and one five
7358,B,Uh-huh.
7359,A,"and, uh, they're in a public school here in Tyler"
7360,A,"and, uh, I'm happy with it."
7361,B,Uh-huh.
7362,A,"I'm happy with the school,"
7363,A,"it's great,"
7364,A,good teachers
7365,A,"good curriculum, uh,"
7366,A,"they learn a lot,"
7367,A,"they have no problems, uh,"
7368,A,"but I do live in the better, well, in the best part of the city,"
7369,A,"though, I live in, you know, the real richy part, I guess."
7370,A,"I'm not,"
7371,A,"but, everybody around me is"
7372,A,"and, uh, but they're,"
7373,A,"I have friends that live in the other, the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town"
7374,A,"and their schools are kind of rundown and, uh, older"
7375,A,"and they don't really offer as much, I don't know, as, uh, the school that my girls are in."
7376,A,I don't really think that's fair. You know.
7377,B,Uh-huh.
7378,A,"Uh, but, you know, I'm happy with what they're in,"
7379,A,"so, go ahead"
7380,B,"Well, yeah,"
7381,B,"it, it's, it's pretty much what I was going to say"
7382,B,is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in.
7383,A,Uh-huh.
7384,B,"Uh, I grew up in New York"
7385,B,"and uh, the place,"
7386,A,Wow.
7387,B,"or not New York City, upstate New York"
7388,A,Uh-huh.
7389,B,"and I went to, uh, the City of Rochester School District"
7390,A,Uh-huh.
7391,B,and a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs
7392,B,"and it wasn't, we weren't too far removed geographically from each other,"
7393,B,but the difference in schools I think was pretty substantial
7394,A,Uh-huh.
7395,B,"and, uh, one of the things that probably would have been better if, is if the entire county had had, had just one school system."
7396,A,Right.
7397,B,"And that would result in some, uh, could result in more equitable distribution of money"
7398,B,"because what was happening was, you know, all the very rich people went out to the, move out to the suburbs"
7399,B,and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with.
7400,A,Uh-huh.
7401,B,"As a result, the schools were rundown,"
7402,B,"there wasn't as many, you know, of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked."
7403,B,"There wasn't as many advanced placement courses, uh, when I was a senior that some other schools had."
7404,A,Uh-huh.
7405,B,"And, uh, it, it,"
7406,B,"so I, you know, I think that one of the things, one of the ways to, to, to help schools in general, uh, and get them all to a minimum level of, of, of competency almost, would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people,"
7407,B,"and the, the problem with that is then, then, then people will either, the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away to get better schools."
7408,A,Yeah.
7409,A,Right
7410,B,"So, you know it, it's kind of, you end up chasing, like a dog chasing its own tail sort of."
7411,A,"Also, uh, the, the family environment,"
7412,A,"you know, you can come to south Tyler where I live"
7413,A,"and you have got room mothers in every room,"
7414,A,"you've got art mothers,"
7415,A,"you've got every, every holiday,"
7416,A,there's parties.
7417,A,"All these kids have these really supportive, really supportive parents, always up there for something."
7418,B,Yeah.
7419,A,You can go to north Tyler to the schools
7420,A,"and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is. You know,"
7421,B,Uh-huh.
7422,A,"uh, that has a, a whole lot to do with it, you know,"
7423,A,"as far as their learning, I mean, if the parents aren't, uh, you know, willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning you know, they really don't have much of a chance at all."
7424,B,Uh-huh.
7425,B,Yeah.
7426,B,Why is that?
7427,A,Huh?
7428,B,Why is that?
7429,A,Why
7430,A,"You they just don't,"
7431,A,"I mean, I mean, I'm, I'm up there at my kids' school,"
7432,A,I know what they're learning
7433,A,"and if they're up, I call and find out, you know,"
7434,A,"is she having problems,"
7435,A,"does she need help with anything,"
7436,A,"no,"
7437,A,"she's doing fine,"
7438,A,"okay, you know, uh,"
7439,A,"and I, I know kids that their parents could really give a rip"
7440,A,and the kids are not motivated.
7441,B,Right.
7442,B,Right.
7443,A,"They have no motivation from home,"
7444,A,so they just go to school
7445,A,"and, you know, you know, I'll get through the day, and, uh, bring homework home"
7446,A,"and, there's nobody to, to sit them down and say, you're going to do this."
7447,B,Right.
7448,A,"Uh, just, you know, they, they take a notion to do it,"
7449,A,"they do,"
7450,A,"and, uh, that doesn't work either, you know,"
7451,A,they have to have guidance
7452,A,"and uh, they can't just have it at school and then come home"
7453,B,Uh-huh.
7454,A,"and there's nothing, you know."
7455,B,"Yeah,"
7456,B,yeah.
7457,B,"Yeah,"
7458,B,"I know that that, that was a big factor for me."
7459,B,"I ended up coming out of, of the public school system very well and was very good education, uh,"
7460,A,Uh-huh.
7461,B,"ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been, you know, which is really nice,"
7462,A,Uh-huh.
7463,B,"and I think the difference for me was that my parents were, you know, they were definitely, they were always there,"
7464,A,Yeah.
7465,B,"was, like, well,"
7466,B,"yeah,"
7467,B,of course you're going to study and do well
7468,B,"and that's the way,"
7469,B,"of course, are you,"
7470,A,The last auto repair I had was
7471,A,I have a nineteen eighty-four Nissan truck
7472,A,I had a tune up done
7473,A,"and I had, I had the brakes done on it"
7474,A,"and then, the reason I did that was because I don't have a scope"
7475,A,and it has eight spark plugs
7476,A,"and it's hard to, to get get at them"
7477,A,and plus the time on them.
7478,A,I just don't have time any more.
7479,A,"Uh, as far as maintenance tasks that I do myself, I, I usually change the oil and wash the air filter"
7480,A,"and I, I had an occasion to change, to have to change the battery once,"
7481,A,"but, the brakes, I was really surprised that the brakes"
7482,A,"I wanted,"
7483,A,I do have the background.
7484,A,I know what needs to be done
7485,A,"and I know that the oil needs, should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings"
7486,A,"and the lube, lubrication system needs to be lubricated and"
7487,A,"so I, I stay on top of that"
7488,A,"but I I wanted my front wheels,"
7489,A,I wanted the bearings packed
7490,A,"and they wanted something like fifteen dollars, uh, a front or something like that"
7491,A,or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it
7492,B,Just to pack the bearings?
7493,A,"just to pack the bearings,"
7494,A,but what I found is that they had a brake job
7495,A,"and they,"
7496,A,"I had them,"
7497,A,"the other thing I let them do some times is that I let them go through and let them tell me what, let them do the diagnostics."
7498,A,"That's free,"
7499,A,okay.
7500,A,"And then I can decide whether I want them to do it or whether I can do it, see."
7501,B,Right.
7502,A,"And they told me that my, my brake pads were gosh, you know, seventy percent still good, you know,"
7503,A,but still it was cheaper in the long run
7504,A,"and uh,"
7505,A,so I just got the the brakes done
7506,A,and I thought that was a good deal.
7507,A,And plus
7508,B,Right.
7509,B,And they repacked the wheel bearings.
7510,A,and they repacked the the wheel bearings.
7511,A,Yeah
7512,A,"but, uh, I've, I've had considerable experience."
7513,A,"I'm, you might say I'm, uh, uh, good back yard mechanic"
7514,A,"and I, you know, I took auto shop in high school,"
7515,A,"it's been a while back,"
7516,A,"but I, I still have a pretty good feel for it,"
7517,A,"but one thing I didn't know is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars,"
7518,A,"I, I had bigger cars"
7519,A,and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those
7520,A,"and what I was surprised at is that on my little Nissan I bought the truck with about sixty thousand, I have almost one hundred and ten,"
7521,A,"so I drove on those brake pads for, uh, you know, forty-five thousand miles"
7522,A,and there was hardly any wear to them.
7523,A,"So those small little trucks and cars like that, they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good. Exactly,"
7524,B,"You know, they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much"
7525,B,and the the surface materials on the pads is so good.
7526,A,"so I, you know, I just did it anyway."
7527,A,"I like to, I like to stay up on it."
7528,A,"You know, like I just kind of stay up on it"
7529,A,"and then if you go and like, just about any point, any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil, the oil is you might say, uh, a white golden brown."
7530,A,"You know, it's not dirty."
7531,A,"I, I, I keep it that way because that's, that is the key to the longevity."
7532,B,Right.
7533,B,Well  it sounds like you've had some good experiences with that
7534,A,"So, so how,"
7535,A,Uh-huh.
7536,B,"uh, and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that."
7537,A,"Oh,"
7538,A,oh.
7539,B,"Uh, I, I get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car"
7540,B,"and, uh  and in fact I have an eighty-seven Mustang with a three O two in it that I've, uh, beefed up a little bit"
7541,A,Uh-huh.
7542,A,Uh-huh.
7543,A,Okay.
7544,B,and one of the things that I did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels
7545,A,Uh-huh
7546,B,"uh, the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that I put on it were, uh, not even cast aluminum."
7547,B,They were just pressed aluminum.
7548,A,You're talking about the vibration dampener?
7549,B,"Well, there's three, there's three pulleys that you change."
7550,B,"You change the crank pulley the alternator pulley and, uh, the water pump pulley."
7551,A,"That's the vibration dampener,"
7552,A,yeah.
7553,A,Okay.
7554,B,"So, when I changed those over, I put on these, these pressed aluminum things"
7555,A,Um.
7556,B,"and, uh, probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out."
7557,A,"Uh, oh."
7558,B,"So in the process of seizing, the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way. But not far enough to notice."
7559,A,Um.
7560,A,"Uh, oh."
7561,A,Huh.
7562,B,"So, I was on my way to work one day"
7563,B,"and, uh, the water pump pulley split laterally in half."
7564,B,So there was half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump
7565,B,and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank
7566,A,Uh-huh.
7567,B,"and uh, I,"
7568,A,"So, the, the topic is hobbies"
7569,B,In your spare time.
7570,A,Yeah.
7571,A,Who has spare time
7572,A,"Um, I don't really, don't really do any handicraft things like that."
7573,A,"I used to. I used to do, like salt ornaments and things."
7574,B,Uh-huh.
7575,A,"But that was, oh, good many, many years ago"
7576,A,"and I have, I really, my spare time"
7577,B,Yeah.
7578,A,"I usually go do aerobics and read,"
7579,A,"and that's,  about it"
7580,B,Yeah.
7581,B,Yeah.
7582,B,I understood that.
7583,B,"I'm, you know, I work full time"
7584,B,and I have two kids
7585,B,so my spare time usually involves something with the kids.
7586,A,Yeah.
7587,B,"You know, hobbies,"
7588,B,"we, I, I can't really say that we have hobbies."
7589,B,It's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend.
7590,B,"You know, we like to go out  go out,"
7591,A,"Yeah,"
7592,A,family.
7593,A,"Well, well, that's what I meant by salt that we, we did that like as a family, little ornaments and, things like that, and just kind of really got into it. Like during the Christmas season, making them up for other people and things like that."
7594,B,Oh.
7595,B,Uh-huh.
7596,B,Right.
7597,A,"But as far as,"
7598,B,Uh-huh.
7599,A,"I've just never been very skilled at,  far, you know, needle, work"
7600,B,Uh-huh.
7601,A,And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good
7602,A,"and,"
7603,B,"I, I guess mostly as far as, as crafts go, I've done, um, some needlepoint."
7604,B,I've done mostly cross stitching.
7605,B,"I used to, uh, do like, um,"
7606,B,"one that I did for both kids are like, oh,"
7607,B,"they're plaques with, you know, different kind of animals"
7608,B,"and then you have their birth date on them,"
7609,A,Yeah.
7610,B,and then you have a little picture of them
7611,B,"and you frame them and stuff,"
7612,A,Uh-huh.
7613,B,but nothing steady.
7614,B,"Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it,"
7615,B,"but, you know, it's nothing that I, can really,"
7616,A,"It's not, like you sit and knit every night"
7617,B,No.
7618,B,Not at all.
7619,A,Yeah.
7620,A,I don't even know how to knit
7621,A,"and my mother used to knit, you know,  all the time"
7622,B,Uh-huh.
7623,A,"and, and I don't even know how to knit"
7624,A,"I'm like, that's a lost art from this family"
7625,B,Yeah.
7626,A,"So, um,"
7627,A,"but, it's not a very good topic"
7628,A,"it feels like,  if, you know,"
7629,B,No.
7630,A,not when you're
7631,A,"neither one of us are really,"
7632,A,"I, I have seen things I really like, you know, that were done, especially like needlepoint."
7633,B,Uh-huh.
7634,A,"Needlepoint, cushions and things."
7635,B,Yeah.
7636,A,"But, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it, you know, and, and that the petty point and things like that."
7637,B,Yeah.
7638,A,"It's like, God, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made"
7639,B,"I don't know what, what, is,"
7640,B,"it's like there,"
7641,B,"but here a lot of the country stuff is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, uh, stenciling."
7642,A,Yeah.
7643,B,"And, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff"
7644,B,and there's just tons of stuff everywhere
7645,B,"and,  you know, people just do it in their garage"
7646,A,Yeah.
7647,B,and then on weekends they go out and sell it
7648,B,and during the week they go back and do some more.
7649,A,"And see, they do that as their job. Whereas,  you know, for us it,"
7650,B,Right
7651,A,and they make it cheaper for us to buy
7652,B,Yeah
7653,B,Definitely.
7654,A,"So,"
7655,A,"but, and, I mean, I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that"
7656,A,"because I can remember when I used to do, you know, those little salt, those figurines and things."
7657,A,"It was, it was relaxing, you know, creative,"
7658,A,you felt very creative.
7659,B,Uh-huh.
7660,A,"But, it just was so time, time,  involved, you know, so much time involved and the different steps and things."
7661,B,Yeah.
7662,B,Uh-huh.
7663,A,"So,"
7664,A,"and,"
7665,B,Okay
7666,B,"Well, I think, I think we're okay."
7667,B,"I think we did five minutes,"
7668,B,so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore
7669,A,Yeah.
7670,A,"So,"
7671,B,Okay.
7672,B,"Well, thank you."
7673,A,Okay.
7674,A,I hope you have a good rest of your weekend.
7675,B,Thanks.
7676,B,Bye-bye.
7677,A,Okay.
7678,A,Bye-bye.
7679,B,Where are you from Tina?
7680,A,"Um, I'm from Maryland"
7681,A,"and, um, I have one son who's almost sixteen months old."
7682,A,"Are, are you married, or ..."
7683,B,"Yeah,"
7684,B,uh-huh.
7685,A,You are.
7686,B,"I have, I have two children,"
7687,B,I have a seven year old and a three year old.
7688,A,Oh.
7689,B,"And, uh, so I try to spend as much time as possible with them."
7690,A,That's good.
7691,A,"Uh, what kind of things do you do?"
7692,B,"Well, um, we do a lot of things with them, you know,"
7693,B,"Taylor my youngest is,"
7694,B,or my oldest is in school
7695,B,and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that.
7696,A,Oh.
7697,B,"was it a big change in your life, to, uh have a child."
7698,A,Oh yeah
7699,A,"Um, yeah,"
7700,A,"it's really nice, uh,"
7701,A,"my husband, uh, is working you know, most of the time."
7702,A,"He's working long hours,"
7703,A,"but, uh, I'm staying home."
7704,B,Uh-huh.
7705,B,Uh-huh.
7706,A,"Uh, I'm just working a couple days a month,"
7707,A,"and, um ..."
7708,B,"Oh, uh-huh."
7709,B,"What do you do during those, those days?"
7710,A,"Um, we spend a lot of time at the playground"
7711,A,"and we go to the zoo,"
7712,A,and we go
7713,A,and we ...
7714,B,"Well you said, you said you worked a couple days a month, though,"
7715,A,"Yeah,"
7716,A,yeah.
7717,B,"what do, what do you do?"
7718,A,I'm a nurse.
7719,B,"Oh, are you?"
7720,A,"So, yeah,"
7721,A,"so it's, it's, it's real easy to work out my schedule, you know, to, uh, get in, to, to still stay in with that, an, and to have enough time to spend with Matthew."
7722,B,Uh-huh.
7723,B,Yeah.
7724,B,Yeah.
7725,A,"He, he's, uh, just now really starting to, to get interested in a lot of things,"
7726,A,"so, um,"
7727,B,"Yeah,"
7728,B,"I understand that,"
7729,B,yeah.
7730,B,They really grow up quick. Especially at that early age.
7731,A,Yeah
7732,B,"But my, my wife was, uh,"
7733,B,"she worked part-time when my oldest was, was little"
7734,B,"and now she's staying home all the time,"
7735,B,"but, uh, that worked out really well because it's a big transition I think to have children."
7736,A,"Oh, yeah."
7737,B,"You know, to go from, you know, nothing, you know,"
7738,B,"if you want to do something every night that's fine,"
7739,B,"but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore,"
7740,B,so.
7741,A,"That's right,"
7742,A,"and I think a lot of people are, um, are turning to, well, I think, I think a lot of people are realizing that"
7743,A,"but still there are so many people that are, you know, have their careers first"
7744,A,"and, it's, uh, I think it's really hurting, uh, the kids, you know,"
7745,B,"Yeah,"
7746,B,yeah.
7747,A,but.
7748,B,"Yeah,"
7749,B,"I agree with you,"
7750,B,"I, I, I think that my wife leaned that way"
7751,B,and I'm really glad she did
7752,B,"and, you know, I'm glad she's staying home,"
7753,B,"but, you know, I know there are some days when she she wishes she was back at work."
7754,A,"I know,"
7755,A,"That's why I like to to, to work a couple days,"
7756,A,"I think it's, uh, it gives me a break."
7757,B,Yeah.
7758,B,"Yeah,"
7759,B,"well see that's, that's why I'm glad my wife did too,"
7760,B,'cause she worked either two to three days a week
7761,B,and that got her out of the house
7762,B,"and yet she'd get to spend, you know, three or four days with ..."
7763,A,"Most of the time at home,"
7764,A,yeah.
7765,B,"Yeah,"
7766,B,"yeah,"
7767,B,and so.
7768,A,"Uh, we had started out like that"
7769,A,"and, um, I think that was really ideal, uh."
7770,B,"Yeah,"
7771,B,"I do to,"
7772,B,"I agree,"
7773,B,"but then when you start having two of them, it's, you know, a little bit tougher, because you've got to make a little more money, to make that payoff and stuff."
7774,A,"It's,"
7775,A,yeah.
7776,A,"Yeah,"
7777,A,"yeah,"
7778,A,"it's difficult,"
7779,A,but.
7780,B,"Are, are you from the Maryland area?"
7781,A,"Uh-huh,"
7782,A,"I'm, I've, I've lived here forever,"
7783,A,so.
7784,B,Really.
7785,A,"Yeah,"
7786,A,"I I live in Germantown,"
7787,A,"and, uh."
7788,A,"Are you, where are you from?"
7789,B,"Um, uh, I'm in Dallas, Texas."
7790,A,"In Dallas,"
7791,A,oh.
7792,B,"Yeah,"
7793,B,"so, uh, I'm, I've lived here like eight years or so,"
7794,B,my wife's from Fort Worth.
7795,A,"Oh, yea-,."
7796,B,"But,"
7797,B,"yeah,"
7798,B,I work for Texas Instruments.
7799,A,"Okay,"
7800,A,"oh,"
7801,A,so that explains.
7802,B,"Yeah,"
7803,B,that explains it doesn't it.
7804,A,"Well, um, I don't know,"
7805,A,"I, uh, we, we do a lot of things on the weekends together, the family,"
7806,B,"Yeah,"
7807,B,yeah.
7808,A,"but, uh, as far as during the week, it's, it's usually, uh, you know, just my son and I,"
7809,A,and we're ...
7810,B,"Yeah,"
7811,B,what's your husband do?
7812,A,"Uh, he, he works for Coca Cola."
7813,B,Uh-huh.
7814,A,"So he, uh, he manages a plant out here,"
7815,B,Oh.
7816,A,"an, and it takes a lot of time."
7817,B,"Oh, yeah,"
7818,B,I'm sure it does.
7819,A,"But, um, it, you know,"
7820,A,"we take walks, and go to the library, and try to fill our day with things like that,"
7821,B,Uh-huh.
7822,B,Yeah.
7823,A,"but, um."
7824,B,"Yeah,"
7825,B,"what, uh,"
7826,B,"my wife did some teaching at like, uh, like a private tutoring place. A Sylvan Learning Center this year"
7827,A,Oh.
7828,B,"and so that, that got me to to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff, you know, 'cause normally if, if they need something they just go to mom. No matter what it is,"
7829,A,Oh.
7830,A,Yeah
7831,B,"I mean, I I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them,"
7832,B,"but, it's so much easier to go to mom,"
7833,A,Right.
7834,B,I guess they get used to it.
7835,B,"So,"
7836,B,"but, you know, we'd go to the library and do things like that,"
7837,B,"yeah,"
7838,B,but
7839,A,"That's good,"
7840,A,that's good.
7841,A,"I know my husband was real, uh,"
7842,A,"in the beginning when he, uh, he was transferred to a, a larger plant"
7843,A,"and he, uh, he works about an hour and a half away from here, from our home,"
7844,B,Uh-huh.
7845,A,"and, uh, so it takes him a little bit of time."
7846,B,"Oh, yeah."
7847,A,"And I'm not able to work during the week, uh, because of that."
7848,A,"He was, I was working in the evening,"
7849,B,Uh-huh.
7850,A,and he was coming home
7851,A,"and I, I could go to work,"
7852,A,"but, uh, their relationship, uh, when I was able to work in the evenings, uh, really grew."
7853,B,Yeah.
7854,B,Uh-huh.
7855,A,"He, you know,"
7856,A,"just the time that they were spending together,"
7857,B,Yeah.
7858,A,"I think it, it really, it really helped to have that time together."
7859,B,"Uh-huh,"
7860,B,it really does
7861,B,"because I think you know, you grow closer."
7862,B,"Was your, uh, was your husband, I mean naturally a child,"
7863,B,"I mean had he been around children,"
7864,B,or ...
7865,A,"Uh, oh yeah,"
7866,A,"he has, uh, he has seven other brothers and sisters,"
7867,B,Oh.
7868,A,"and they have, we have thirteen grand,"
7869,A,well his parents have thirteen grandchildren.
7870,B,Uh-huh.
7871,A,"So it's, uh, you know, there's a lot of kids in the family"
7872,A,"and, and he really enjoys it."
7873,B,"Yeah,"
7874,B,yeah.
7875,A,"But, uh, right now it's kind of a difficult time,"
7876,A,but ...
7877,B,Yeah.
7878,A,"And, and the cost of living here is just so tremendously, you know, outrageous"
7879,B,"Yeah,"
7880,B,yeah.
7881,A,"Um, it's difficult, uh, to do it any other way."
7882,B,"Yeah,"
7883,B,I understand.
7884,A,Yeah.
7885,B,"I'm, I, you know"
7886,B,"it's, it's hard because, you know,"
7887,B,"then you're not getting to spend as much time with, at home,"
7888,B,I mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to.
7889,A,That's right.
7890,B,"So, yeah,"
7891,B,"that that's a tough situation,"
7892,B,"but then, then again, you know, some,"
7893,B,"you got to do what you got to do, you know to get along, too,"
7894,A,Yeah.
7895,B,so.
7896,A,"Yeah,"
7897,A,"yeah,"
7898,A,"at least, I, I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home"
7899,A,"It, uh,"
7900,B,"Uh-huh,"
7901,B,"well like I said my wife normally feels that way,"
7902,B,"there are days when, uh, I come home and she says here take these kids,"
7903,B,I'm getting out.
7904,A,I know
7905,B,"So she's, she's had about enough during those days,"
7906,B,"but. But, for the most part, I, you know, I've really feel like that's led,"
7907,A,I know.
7908,B,"the way that, you know,"
7909,B,"like what you said with the cost of living and everything, I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an and won't."
7910,A,Yeah.
7911,A,Yeah.
7912,B,"And so I think that's tended to lead to a decline in, in families and family values especially."
7913,A,"Oh yeah,"
7914,A,it has.
7915,B,"And I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that, you know, we need to do something about,"
7916,B,but I don't know what.
7917,A,"I believe that too,"
7918,A,"and I think, uh, the kids are where they need to, you know,"
7919,B,Yeah.
7920,A,they need to really focus on the children in the in this country.
7921,B,Yeah.
7922,B,"Would, would you have said that a couple of years ago, do you think?"
7923,A,"No,"
7924,A,"I didn't, I didn't even really think about it that much, I mean, you know,"
7925,B,Uh-huh.
7926,A,"I, I was aware, vaguely aware of it,"
7927,A,"but, um, I didn't it wasn't really that important to me,"
7928,A,"and, uh, ..."
7929,B,"Uh-huh,"
7930,B,it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child.
7931,A,"Oh, it, it really does,"
7932,A,"I,"
7933,A,"just the whole, uh, you know,"
7934,A,"seeing how you really are are, are forming this, you know, the mind"
7935,B,Uh-huh.
7936,B,"Well, you know, in the next year or so, you'll see so many instances where, you know, he'll mimic something that you've done,"
7937,B,"and you see, you know, everything I'm doing, he's learning from."
7938,A,That's right.
7939,B,"And, and, you think, if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care."
7940,A,Yeah.
7941,B,"You know, that's how they're developing their patterns."
7942,B,"And I think a lot of people either, don't care, or don't realize it, you know."
7943,B,"That's,"
7944,A,"Or, or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide."
7945,B,Yeah.
7946,A,"I, I've seen a lot of people just say well, you know, he'll learn everything when he gets into, uh, you know,"
7947,B,Yeah
7948,B,eventually.
7949,B,"Yeah,"
7950,B,it's true.
7951,A,"but it, um,"
7952,A,"I, I know,"
7953,A,"even just this first year, that I've been with, uh, my son, here, um, he's,"
7954,A,"I can just see how much, of, of a difference it makes staying home with him, instead of, uh,"
7955,B,"Uh-huh,"
7956,B,Yeah.
7957,B,"Yeah,"
7958,B,"plus, plus I think it becomes part of part of you too,"
7959,B,"I mean, you get to stay home,"
7960,B,"I mean it's not just for him,"
7961,B,"but it's also for you, because you're both kind of bonding together there too, I think,"
7962,B,so.
7963,A,"Yeah,"
7964,A,that's true.
7965,B,Well it's been nice talking to you.
7966,A,"Well it's nice talking to you, too."
7967,B,Okay
7968,B,good luck.
7969,A,Okay.
7970,B,"Okay,"
7971,B,good-bye.
7972,B,"Lynn, do you, do you want to start?"
7973,A,Certainly.
7974,B,Okay.
7975,A,"Um,"
7976,B,Do you want to tell me about vacations you've taken
7977,B,"or,"
7978,A,"Well, I, I tend to, uh, take two kinds of vacations, the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that."
7979,B,Uh-huh.
7980,B,Which is your favorite?
7981,A,"Oh, well, I couldn't live without the family vacations,"
7982,A,"but, uh, my favorite is the, the indulgent ones, where we go off and, and, uh, see places that have interested me since I was a kid, for the most part."
7983,B,Uh-huh.
7984,A,"And, uh,"
7985,B,"Your family doesn't live close, then?"
7986,A,"Uh, not anymore."
7987,A,"They, uh, they've been in San Diego for the last few years,"
7988,A,and they're moving to Florida.
7989,B,Okay.
7990,A,"And that's one of those things,"
7991,A,you just have to go once a year.
7992,B,"Yep,"
7993,B,I understand.
7994,A,"So, uh, basically it, it sorts out into that,"
7995,A,"and then once, about once every three or four years I try to get over to England, because I lived there for a while, some years back."
7996,B,Wow.
7997,B,I've only been there once.
7998,A,Oh.
7999,B,and I'd love to go back.
8000,A,Beautiful country.
8001,A,"Beautiful country,"
8002,B,"And it was,"
8003,A,beautiful people.
8004,B,"Yeah,"
8005,B,"it,"
8006,A,"But, uh,"
8007,A,"and I'd real,  really like to go because, um, I'm fairly recently married"
8008,B,we had a great time.
8009,A,"and, and my husband has been hearing about these people for years"
8010,A,"and, uh, but he's never met them,"
8011,A,"so, uh, I'd like, I'd like to do that."
8012,A,"But anyway, that's, that's our typical vacation,"
8013,A,"and, uh, we enjoy the family vacations,"
8014,A,"but the other ones are very special getaways,"
8015,A,and we probably take one of each every year.
8016,A,How about yourself?
8017,B,"Well, uh, we, we, as you do, take family vacations, uh, sometimes one a year,"
8018,B,"and, but this year we're not going to be taking one for several reasons."
8019,B,"But vacations we really enjoy,"
8020,B,I think we've been on three cruises.
8021,A,"Oh, I've never, been on a cruise."
8022,B,"And we, we really love cruises."
8023,B,We've gone on CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES.
8024,A,Uh-huh.
8025,B,"And, uh, we've gone fairly inexpensive from, as most cruises go."
8026,B,"Uh, we usually book just a month before it's ready to go."
8027,A,Yeah.
8028,B,And we get upgraded.
8029,B,"Last last two times, in fact, we had an outside room"
8030,B,and it was beautiful.
8031,A,Um.
8032,B,And we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around.
8033,B,"It's kind of,"
8034,A,"Well, what do you do on a cruise?"
8035,A,I've never been on a cruise.
8036,B,"Oh, my God, you do everything."
8037,B,"You, I mean, you can be as busy as you want to be, or as laid back as you want to be."
8038,B,"You can sit in the sun all day around the pool,"
8039,B,or you can take part in the games that they have going on.
8040,B,They always have bingo.
8041,B,They have a casino.
8042,B,"Uh, they have a massage parlor."
8043,B,"They have exercise,"
8044,B,"I mean, you can do anything."
8045,A,Huh.
8046,B,And that's just aboard ship.
8047,B,"And then when the ship docks, you get to go sight-seeing and shopping."
8048,A,Uh-huh.
8049,B,And that's quite fun.
8050,A,Uh-huh.
8051,A,And where have you been on these cruises?
8052,B,"Uh, Nassau, San Juan, Saint Thomas."
8053,B,We've been there twice.
8054,B,"We went two cruises that hit those islands, but with different people."
8055,B,"We, we've gone with friends each time."
8056,A,I see.
8057,B,"And then we went to, uh, the western Caribbean, which is, uh, Port, uh, Cancun, Cozumel,  and Ocho Rios."
8058,A,"Oh, the, the Mexican coast."
8059,B,Pardon me?
8060,A,"That's all Mexico, I think."
8061,B,"Yes,"
8062,B,uh-huh.
8063,B,"And, but it was wonderful."
8064,B,So we really like those.
8065,B,"And, uh, I guess we just like to go someplace, someplace entirely different."
8066,B,We've been to a few places in this country.
8067,B,"We still have a lot to see, though."
8068,A,Where are you from originally?
8069,B,We're from Illinois originally.
8070,A,Uh-huh.
8071,B,"And we've been down in Texas eighteen years,"
8072,B,"and so, like you, we always try to make it, you know, back home to see the relatives."
8073,B,We both still have family there.
8074,A,Uh-huh.
8075,B,And that's fun.
8076,B,It brings back a lot of memories.
8077,A,"Oh, yes."
8078,B,"Uh, things are different there, though."
8079,B,"They're, uh,"
8080,B,I don't know.
8081,B,It's just entirely different world than this
8082,A,"Well, I, I grew up in Dallas,"
8083,A,"so I mean, it's not, it's not like I'm going home."
8084,B,Did you?
8085,A,"My, my parents retired first to San Diego,"
8086,B,Uh-huh.
8087,A,"and they're going now to Florida,"
8088,A,"and so they're going very nice places,"
8089,A,"thank God,"
8090,B,Uh-huh.
8091,A,that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know.
8092,A,"I really came to love San Diego and feel very, comfortable there."
8093,A,They've been there eight years.
8094,B,Uh-huh.
8095,A,"And, uh, you know, I just grab the car and drive everywhere."
8096,B,"Oh, that's great."
8097,A,"So it, it is, it is nice,"
8098,A,but it's not home.
8099,A,"This is home,"
8100,A,"and, um, and I've never thought about a cruise."
8101,A,It's so funny.
8102,B,"Oh, they, they, they really are."
8103,B,"We've, yeah, as I said, we've done them three times."
8104,B,"We'd be going again this, this year if circumstances hadn't changed."
8105,B,"We, we'd probably go."
8106,A,Uh-huh.
8107,B,"My husband would, you know,"
8108,B,"the minute I said the word, he, he, he's chomping at the bit."
8109,B,He kind of likes the casinos a little bit.
8110,A,Uh-huh.
8111,B,But I like all of that.
8112,A,"What's the best part, from your point of view?"
8113,B,I like seeing other countries and shopping in other places.
8114,A,Uh-huh.
8115,B,I like shopping.
8116,B,"I can shop anyplace, shop in London and France and wherever."
8117,B,"Now, my kids are moving to Toronto,"
8118,B,so we're going to be able to go up there.
8119,A,"Oh, that will be nice."
8120,B,"So I'm kind of looking forward to that, except I hate to see them go."
8121,A,"Oh, sure."
8122,B,"But,"
8123,A,Sure.
8124,A,"Well, go in, don't go in the winter."
8125,B,"Oh, that's what everybody says,"
8126,B,"and I, I think it's,"
8127,B,"I think I'll try to stay away, except my, my second grandchild will be born in in the winter in January."
8128,A,Oh.
8129,B,So that will be hard to stay away from.
8130,A,"Well, there are exceptions made for special occasions like that."
8131,B,Yeah.
8132,A,But the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer
8133,A,"so,"
8134,B,"Isn't that the truth,"
8135,B,uh-huh.
8136,A,"Huh. Well, that sounds wonderful."
8137,A,"I, I guess I, I would contemplate going on a cruise, uh, oh, all circumstances permitting it."
8138,B,"Well, there's all age groups too,"
8139,B,"and that's, that's kind of fun."
8140,B,"Uh, you, if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals, you meet different people."
8141,A,Uh-huh.
8142,B,"You may meet people, you know, thirty years older than you, or younger,"
8143,B,"and everybody is really interesting,"
8144,B,and everybody is there to have a good time
8145,B,"and,"
8146,A,Huh. How long are the cruises?
8147,B,"Uh, we've only gone on the seven day cruises."
8148,A,Uh-huh.
8149,B,They have shorter ones
8150,B,and then they have ten day ones.
8151,B,But I think seven days is long enough for us.
8152,B,By that time we're ready to get home and get back to our routine.
8153,A,Yeah.
8154,B,"I think most vacations, uh, seven days is enough for us."
8155,B,"We've gone,"
8156,B,"I think when we went to England and France, we were there ten, twelve days,"
8157,B,and that was pushing it a bit.
8158,A,Yeah.
8159,A,"Uh, I tend, when, when I spend enough money to go overseas"
8160,A,"I, go for a long time."
8161,B,Yeah.
8162,B,"Well, that, that makes sense, it really does."
8163,B,"I mean, oh, we went to Panama too."
8164,A,"Oh, that's interesting."
8165,B,Went to Panama last August.
8166,A,Uh-huh.
8167,B,Our son-in-law is from Panama.
8168,A,Oh.
8169,B,"And, uh, we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents, who live there."
8170,A,Uh-huh.
8171,B,"And his father is a, a doctor"
8172,B,"and his mother is a kindergarten teacher,"
8173,B,"and they took time off,"
8174,B,it was their winter
8175,B,"and they were having a little break,"
8176,B,"so they took some time off that, uh, they could show us around."
8177,B,"And it, it is a beautiful country."
8178,A,Huh.
8179,B,It is beautiful.
8180,B,They have mountains.
8181,B,We were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore.
8182,A,That's really nice.
8183,B,"And it, it is gorgeous."
8184,B,"They live in a small town called David, which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica."
8185,A,Uh-huh.
8186,B,"And, uh, it's, it's just, it's just a gorgeous country."
8187,B,Most people don't realize it.
8188,B,"I think if they could get tourists coming to their country, they'd improve the economy considerably."
8189,A,"Huh. Well, may, maybe now things are calming down again. That will happen."
8190,B,Yeah.
8191,B,"We really hope, hope so."
8192,A,"Well, that, that's really great. Uh,"
8193,B,Yeah.
8194,A,"I, I mean, as I said, basically all I've done is go back and forth to parents"
8195,A,"and, uh,"
8196,B,"Well, that, that's, that's pretty good."
8197,B,That's pretty good.
8198,A,"And, and, uh, we had, my husband had a conference in L A,"
8199,A,so we spent a week in L A
8200,A,"and of course,"
8201,B,"Oh, do you like L A?"
8202,A,"Uh, I'm, I'm, I'm very unusual."
8203,A,"I like,"
8204,B,You ready?
8205,A,Yeah.
8206,B,Okay.
8207,B,What have you seen lately?
8208,A,"Well, uh, it's funny, when I tried, to make the call the other days,"
8209,A,"I thought,"
8210,A,I hadn't seen anything since DANCES WITH WOLVES
8211,A,but today I went to see REGARDING WITH HENRY.
8212,B,"Oh, I'm dying to see that."
8213,A,It was really good.
8214,A,We
8215,B,Oh.
8216,A,"uh, Jeff Wariner just got out of the hospital"
8217,B,Uh-huh
8218,A,"and, uh, Jeff and Deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood,"
8219,A,"and, uh, we all liked it."
8220,A,"We had both moms and, uh, fifteen year olds and a twelve year old"
8221,A,and everyone enjoyed it.
8222,B,"Oh, my goodness."
8223,A,"And, uh,"
8224,B,"Oh, well I am just dying to see it."
8225,B,I went to dinner with some friends last weekend
8226,B,and they said get a baby-sitter
8227,B,and we'll all go see REGARDING HENRY
8228,A,Yeah.
8229,B,"and I said, ooh, I want to see it so bad."
8230,A,"Well, my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer, on, choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another. A lot of the ones I had wanted to see"
8231,B,Oh.
8232,A,"and so since he had this friend up from Houston, uh, and his friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this and I thought well, I want to see this one, too."
8233,A,"So, we, uh,  I"
8234,B,Yeah.
8235,A,"finally, it's my first summer movie"
8236,B,Oh my.
8237,B,"Well, let me see."
8238,B,"Was it,"
8239,B,"well, we went to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS last weekend"
8240,B,"and that may be,"
8241,B,"no,"
8242,B,"right before I went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on,"
8243,B,we're going to the movies.
8244,B,"And we won't,"
8245,B,well she goes all the time
8246,B,but I go maybe once every couple of months.
8247,A,Yeah.
8248,B,"And when I go, I go see two at a time."
8249,B,"So we went to see SOAPDISH,"
8250,B,and
8251,A,"Oh, was that good?"
8252,A,"Cause,"
8253,B,"Oh, hysterical."
8254,B,"We laughed so hard,"
8255,B,"it was just, you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing   so hard."
8256,A,Yeah.
8257,A,"Well, I want to see that and CITY SLICKERS both."
8258,A,I love   comedies.
8259,B,Yeah
8260,A,"But, that's what I was"
8261,B,that's the other one that we went to that night.
8262,A,"Oh, was it?"
8263,B,"And, my face hurt so bad, from laughing because I love Billy Crystal."
8264,A,Oh
8265,B,"And course, growing up on, on the back of a horse, you know, and being on ranches and stuff, so much of that was so true"
8266,B,and I was absolutely rolling in the aisles.
8267,B,It was so funny.
8268,B,Both of them were great.
8269,A,"Oh, well good."
8270,A,"I'm, I'm glad to hear that because they,"
8271,B,"Oh, they are, are"
8272,B,we just laughed so hard.
8273,B,"And like I said, with CITY I mean with SOAPDISH, it is so cornball"
8274,B,and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know.
8275,A,Uh-huh
8276,B,"Just, they just carried it off, to the tee."
8277,A,"Well, I don't, I don't know if you got to see WEEKEND, um, AT BERNIE'S  that was out a couple of years ago."
8278,B,No.
8279,A,"They had a free showing at the Berkeley, um, United Artist."
8280,B,How neat.
8281,A,"And, I don't know who was here or whether Jay called a friend"
8282,A,and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in
8283,A,"but we thought we'd try it, you know, free movie."
8284,B,"Shoot,"
8285,B,yeah.
8286,A,"It was so funny and it sounds like, uh, what you were just describing, SOAPDISH, too."
8287,A,"I mean, we just, we hurt by the time we came out."
8288,B,Oh yeah.
8289,A,And the whole theater was hysterical
8290,A,"and it's just, it's just goofy."
8291,A,"I mean, it's, uh,"
8292,A,"if you have a chance to rent it, at least,"
8293,A,"or it should be out on T V, I would think,"
8294,B,"Yeah,"
8295,B,I think it is.
8296,B,I think it is.
8297,A,"Um, cause it's, it's just a fun summer light comedy,"
8298,A,make your cheeks hurt laughing.
8299,A,"Especially in the theater it was contagious, you know"
8300,B,Yeah.
8301,A,"I, I imagine the way SOAPDISH was, but, with   everyone laughing."
8302,B,Oh gosh
8303,B,I never laughed.
8304,B,And people were just screaming and applauding
8305,B,"and, you know, it was just hysterical."
8306,A,"Well, I'm glad you did that before your surgery"
8307,B,"Oh, me too, because I don't even know if I could live through it now."
8308,A,Yeah
8309,B,I mean I'm getting around real good
8310,B,and I'm just still real sore.
8311,A,Yeah.
8312,B,"And today I was, I, course I went back to work two weeks after, uh"
8313,A,"Oh, gosh."
8314,B,but see I don't have permanent work.
8315,B,"I, right now I'm working with a temporary agency."
8316,B,"And so, the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free."
8317,A,Oh.
8318,B,"Oh, so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants,"
8319,B,and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed.
8320,A,Yeah.
8321,B,And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day.
8322,B,"And I said, yeah,"
8323,B,and I went
8324,B,and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that.
8325,B,"And, uh, I worked about three days a week ever since, two to three days a week."
8326,B,"And so I went to my doctors last Thursday,"
8327,B,and this was my fourth week checkup
8328,B,"and he said well gosh, you're just healing really well,"
8329,B,I just can't get over this.
8330,B,"He says, in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things."
8331,B,"If you want to play ball, you can go play ball."
8332,B,"He says, now I'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball"
8333,B,but you can if you want to.
8334,A,Yeah
8335,B,"And, uh, you know, he was teasing me"
8336,B,"and he says, yeah,"
8337,B,"you'll be out there waterskiing,"
8338,B,I can just see it now.
8339,B,"And, uh, he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks."
8340,B,You've only got two more weeks.
8341,B,"I said okay fine, I, I will, I will"
8342,B,"Whatever you call easy, I'll do it, you know."
8343,B,But and I've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it.
8344,A,Yeah.
8345,A,Yeah
8346,B,"And so, I don't, I'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when I was, when I'm still sort of on the sore side."
8347,A,Yeah
8348,B,"But,"
8349,B,"well, what's your next,"
8350,B,have you seen ROBIN HOOD yet?
8351,A,"No,"
8352,A,"that was one, uh, Jay got to see with a friend"
8353,A,and so I
8354,B,Uh.
8355,A,"and to try and, uh, try and find time it's hard, uh, with Jim's schedule, too, just to get a time that we can both go."
8356,B,Oh yeah.
8357,A,"And, uh, I'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because, uh, we had friends that went to see that and said, you know, it's just perfect for our age group"
8358,B,Uh-huh.
8359,A,"and because I think he, he needs a comedy, too."
8360,A,"Uh, and that's what he would have liked to have seen REGARDING HENRY, too,"
8361,A,"but knew that, uh,"
8362,A,"we've, we've got a lot of company this summer, which is wonderful."
8363,A,We're really enjoying it
8364,A,"but some of the different things we're doing, uh  there's just not a time, enough time to do it all"
8365,B,Uh-huh.
8366,A,"and he said, well, realistically  You know, he knew he couldn't get them all in."
8367,B,Yeah.
8368,A,"But, uh, Jay really liked ROBIN HOOD."
8369,A,"Um, when the choir group went to see BACKDRAFT and they thought that was, uh, it was funny cause he sounded like the critics."
8370,A,"He said, you know the plot line and the characters, uh, you know aren't real big"
8371,A,"but the, the fire scenes and the you know  that action part is fantastic."
8372,B,Uh-huh.
8373,A,"But, he thought ROBIN HOOD was great."
8374,A,"It was real different then you'd expect,"
8375,A,but  but he enjoyed it
8376,B,Oh really?
8377,A,"and so,"
8378,B,"Well I went,"
8379,B,course I am a Kevin Costner fan.
8380,A,"Yeah,"
8381,A,me too.
8382,A,"And  yeah,"
8383,B,Supreme.
8384,A,"I really, uh, like him a lot. Which is why, DANCES WITH WOLVES was the last movie we had seen   for several months"
8385,B,Uh-huh.
8386,A,"but,"
8387,B,"Gosh, was that wonderful."
8388,A,"It was,"
8389,A,"I, uh,"
8390,A,"in fact, uh, a friend from Germany was visiting in March"
8391,A,"and we wanted, we didn't, ran out of time, we wanted to take him to see it."
8392,A,"We were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it, too."
8393,B,"Oh, yeah."
8394,A,"Uh, I just thought that was terrific."
8395,A,"And I really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons I wanted to see,"
8396,B,"I do, too."
8397,B,I think he's really good.
8398,A,And he's very good in REGARDING HENRY.
8399,A,"That's not an easy part to play, I, I don't think"
8400,B,I wouldn't think.
8401,B,"Well, my kids are going to their Dad's tomorrow night"
8402,B,so I sort of think I may go do that.
8403,A,Yeah.
8404,A,"That's at, that one won't your sides"
8405,B,Good
8406,A,"Um, it,"
8407,A,was this the first time you got to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS?
8408,A,"Or,"
8409,B,I
8410,B,my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie's age begin to
8411,A,Uh-huh.
8412,B,"And we went to the,"
8413,A,my number.
8414,A,Okay.
8415,B,Okay.
8416,B,"So are you a, a, a golfer"
8417,B,or are you a spectator?
8418,A,"Oh, I'm a,"
8419,A,I play golf
8420,A,but I don't actually play golf.
8421,B,"Well, I'm the same way."
8422,B,"I,  I go out there and hit the ball."
8423,A,Yeah.
8424,A,Hack it all over the place?
8425,B,Yeah.
8426,A,"It's sickening, isn't it?"
8427,B,"Um, uh, well, in the Carolinas it's, it's just, you know, we've got a bunch of golf courses around here."
8428,A,Yeah.
8429,A,We've got tons up here
8430,A,but I don't know.
8431,A,How do you feel about your game?
8432,A,I guess that's a good question?
8433,B,"Uh, well, I mean I'm not a serious golfer at all,"
8434,B,"uh, uh, a friend of mine goes golfing a lot"
8435,B,and he drags me out every now and then
8436,B,"and I, uh, I don't have a, I don't really even have a game."
8437,B,I usually
8438,B,"when I go out and play golf it's usually like at a, at one of these par threes that, you know, you,"
8439,A,Yeah.
8440,B,"but, um, I like watching it on T V."
8441,A,"Yeah,"
8442,A,I like that too.
8443,A,I don't know
8444,A,"I try to play,"
8445,A,"but God, I, a couple years ago I played two, three times a week and got lousy."
8446,A,I guess that's the best I ever got was lousy.
8447,A,And I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to come
8448,A,and then I got worse again
8449,A,so.
8450,B,"get they, they say I hit worm burners because I, I can't hit it up in the air."
8451,A,Yeah.
8452,B,So I'm pretty bad
8453,B,"but I, I, I get great distance hitting it, you know, across the ground,"
8454,B,"and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I'm,"
8455,B,but I'm getting better.
8456,B,"I've got where now I can hit it in, in the air some of the time."
8457,A,That's pretty good.
8458,B,Yeah.
8459,B,"Uh, so I'm kind of a novice at it."
8460,A,"Um, I'm that and worse."
8461,A,"I, I play"
8462,A,"next year I,"
8463,A,actually I take it kind of seriously
8464,A,but I've been doing so bad.
8465,A,"Next year, I always say this every year, but next year I'm starting over from scratch."
8466,A,I'm going to go take lessons and everything.
8467,A,"I'm going to do it right, and see if I can actually play this game or not."
8468,B,"Well, that I, I guess that's what I need to do is, is get some kind of lessons or something."
8469,B,"Because I, my, my tee off is not bad,"
8470,B,"I mean I'm, I'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that"
8471,B,"it's just, that, that initial tee"
8472,A,"Yeah,"
8473,A,what do you do when you're putting?
8474,A,That's a good thing.
8475,A,That's something I could learn actually.
8476,A,That's when I do my worst.
8477,A,I finally get to the green
8478,A,"and I think I'm doing all, all fine"
8479,A,"and then,"
8480,B,"Just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really,"
8481,B,"you know, checking the ground and, and so forth, you know."
8482,A,Yeah.
8483,B,See how it's going to break or whatever.
8484,A,Can you really see it though?
8485,B,Yeah.
8486,A,What about the speed?
8487,B,"If you get, if you get down on the ground you really can."
8488,A,"Can you tell but can you tell how, how fast you're going to hit it?"
8489,B,"Um, well, if you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it"
8490,B,"but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's, it's, you know,"
8491,B,because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction.
8492,A,"Yeah,"
8493,A,but you can feel that?
8494,B,Yeah.
8495,A,I don't know
8496,A,"I have, I can get it within like, you know, four or five feet or something"
8497,A,but I don't have enough field.
8498,A,Now I'm T V watching.
8499,B,Yeah.
8500,A,They make you die at the hole every time.
8501,B,Yeah.
8502,A,"Oh, it just dies and rolls in."
8503,A,"I don't know,"
8504,B,"But I,"
8505,A,it's hard for me.
8506,B,"The, the,"
8507,B,"it's, it's like I said"
8508,B,"once I get up on the green I'm fine,"
8509,B,"but that, that tee shot, uh, it, you know,"
8510,B,when teeing off I'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground
8511,B,"so it, it takes me awhile to get to the hole"
8512,B,"but,"
8513,A,"Once you're there, you're all set though."
8514,B,I'm all set.
8515,A,We should play team golf then.
8516,A,I'll get us there
8517,A,and you put it in.
8518,B,that sounds good to me.
8519,A,I
8520,A,"oh, the T V golfers they do that."
8521,A,It takes them two to get there and two to get it in
8522,A,so it's fifty percent.
8523,A,And me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in.
8524,B,"Well, it, it, it usually takes me about probably two, two or three to get it there"
8525,B,"and, and then, that's according to the hole"
8526,B,and it
8527,B,"uh, uh, maybe one or two putts."
8528,B,"It's,  according to where I'm at on the green."
8529,A,Yeah.
8530,A,That's good.
8531,B,"But the friends I play with, uh, they play all the time"
8532,B,"and, and they're really good."
8533,A,Joe Pros?
8534,B,"Uh, they're not Joe Pros"
8535,B,"but they, they golf in the high sixties low seventies"
8536,B,so I guess they're pretty good
8537,A,That's pretty good.
8538,A,For eighteen?
8539,B,Yeah.
8540,B,For eighteen.
8541,A,"Wow,"
8542,A,that's pretty good.
8543,B,Yeah.
8544,A,I'm talking to the wrong guy.
8545,A,Your shitty golf is probably the best golf I've ever seen.
8546,B,"No,"
8547,B,"no,"
8548,B,"no,"
8549,B,that's not my golf.
8550,B,That's my friends.
8551,B,"Mine, mine,"
8552,B,"I'm, I'm usually in the eighties or nineties"
8553,B,"so I'm, I'm not good"
8554,A,"If, when I'm in the nineties I'm feeling good."
8555,A,I'm usually around a hundred.
8556,A,That's my thing. Around a hundred.
8557,A,"You know, I can hit a great drives and think I'm going to do all awesome on this hole"
8558,A,but it ain't going to happen.
8559,B,"Well, I either, teeing off I either slice it"
8560,B,or I hook it ever single time
8561,B,"and, and I alternate."
8562,A,"Well, it's a good thing with me I slice it every single time."
8563,A,That's good.
8564,A,"I aim,"
8565,B,Okay.
8566,A,Okay.
8567,B,"Universal health insurance,"
8568,B,right?
8569,A,That's right.
8570,A,What would we like to say
8571,A,"I think,"
8572,A,Uh-huh.
8573,A,I think that's what the subject is about.
8574,B,"Did you read, uh, the article in the paper today about this particular subject?"
8575,A,"In the Dallas, the MORNING TIMES?"
8576,B,Yeah.
8577,A,I guess I did not.
8578,B,"Uh, the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is, uh, going to begin testing a program, a state funded program for citizens of those two states"
8579,B,"and there's fourteen other, uh, states that are considering it. Least according to the article in the paper this morning."
8580,B,"I think it's a trend that's, that's, that's, uh, probably may go nationwide eventually because I think national health is something that we all need."
8581,B,"It's getting to a point that you have to have it,"
8582,B,you have to have some form of health insurance.
8583,A,"Well, it's been interesting that we,"
8584,B,"Extremely expensive, though."
8585,A,Yes.
8586,A,"So we live in a society, though, where everyone if you ask them on polls, will, uh, say that they think that everyone has a right to health care."
8587,B,Uh-huh.
8588,A,"And yet, I don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it."
8589,B,"Well, that's the thing, you know,"
8590,B,"uh, unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are, are paying for the people that don't have health insurance."
8591,A,Which is why people are talking about
8592,A,we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair.
8593,B,Yeah.
8594,B,"I don't think you, uh,"
8595,A,You have health insurance?
8596,B,"Yes,"
8597,B,I do.
8598,A,Through your company?
8599,B,"Uh, through my company,"
8600,B,yes.
8601,B,"But I have been in a situation, uh, recently where I was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year"
8602,B,and my wife developed cancer.
8603,B,We didn't have any insurance.
8604,A,"Oh, my goodness."
8605,B,And it was a go to Parkland type situation.
8606,A,That's must have been hard
8607,A,How was your care at Parkland?
8608,B,"Uh, because it was a life threatening situation, it was very good."
8609,B,"Uh, as it, as it turned out one of the top, uh, people, or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at Parkland."
8610,A,"But, yet, Parkland is not free, either."
8611,B,"No,"
8612,B,"it's not free,"
8613,B,"but, uh, It's, it's a situation that because I didn't have any insurance and I was on unemployment, it was paid by the county."
8614,A,Is it affordable?
8615,A,So you did have a good experience.
8616,B,I had a bad experience as it turned out.
8617,B,"Uh, I was fortunate that there was Parkland."
8618,A,"Is your wife better, I hope?"
8619,B,"Uh, no she passed away."
8620,A,I'm real sorry.
8621,B,That's all right.
8622,A,Sure. *listen; is this a question?
8623,B,That happens.
8624,A,"It does happen,"
8625,A,but it's very sad.
8626,B,"Yeah,"
8627,B,"but in any event, uh, I'm in favor of national health. If I had to vote for it."
8628,A,Well so am I.
8629,A,"Actually, uh, I'm a pediatrician"
8630,B,"Oh, is that right?"
8631,A,"and I feel very strongly about, uh, children, and, uh, developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year. Where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most."
8632,B,Uh-huh.
8633,B,Uh-huh.
8634,A,"So, uh, I'm really quite active in trying to, uh, be proactive at least for children's issues."
8635,A,"It's very complex, very complicated,"
8636,A,"but, uh, I strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization, glasses, hearing aids basic health benefits."
8637,B,"Well, I, when I grew up and"
8638,B,"I grew up in south central Kansas, uh,"
8639,B,"we had,"
8640,B,"and my mom worked for the health department, the county health department"
8641,B,"and we had x-rays every year,"
8642,B,"we had a dentist come to our school and, uh, check our teeth once a year at least."
8643,B,"Uh, we had all our flu shots taken care of, our measles, mumps, rubella and all that other stuff."
8644,A,Um.
8645,B,"And, uh, when my children were growing up, we didn't have that."
8646,B,"We had to pay for it, which I wasn't opposed to paying for it."
8647,B,"I had the money to pay for it,"
8648,B,but I'm sure that there were people that don't.
8649,A,"Well, and the costs have, so much has gone up so much."
8650,A,"The cost of immunizations for example, uh, and just the legal the legal benefits, uh,"
8651,A,"that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily, et cetera."
8652,B,Uh-huh.
8653,A,"So, well, I don't know,"
8654,A,"it's, it is interesting,"
8655,A,"in case you didn't know, Texas leads the nation in uninsured children."
8656,A,Thirty-one percent of all Texas children do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid.
8657,B,Did not know that.
8658,A,"So, uh, one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care."
8659,A,And I work in the children's Parkland system
8660,A,and it's pretty overwhelming to me.
8661,B,Uh-huh.
8662,A,"But, uh, it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county."
8663,B,"Okay,"
8664,B,so now what are your opinions on recycling?
8665,A,"Well, I definitely think that we need to start recycling."
8666,A,"I think it has got to be an individual responsibility until,"
8667,A,"I think if we wait, uh, which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it is going to be to late."
8668,B,Yeah.
8669,A,I have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand.
8670,B,"Yeah,"
8671,B,I have heard that too.
8672,A,"And that is not too far away,"
8673,A,but I don't know how it is there.
8674,A,It is very difficult here even if you care like I do to do much.
8675,A,"I take, my paper,"
8676,A,I can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store
8677,B,Uh-huh.
8678,A,and I can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them
8679,A,and there are some fire stations I can take newspapers to
8680,A,and that is very inconvenient cause I have to wait until I have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile.
8681,B,"Well see, I started saving newspapers"
8682,B,and I would take a ton of them
8683,A,Uh-huh.
8684,B,"and, uh, that's, I can't remember where I went to take them,"
8685,B,but they wouldn't take them.
8686,A,Yeah.
8687,A,It is real hard to find a spot
8688,A,"and then, I don't know if you note, even doing that, the amount of trash we throw away is incredible"
8689,A,bottles
8690,B,Oh I know.
8691,A,glass
8692,A,"that cannot be, it could be recycled,"
8693,A,"but there is no place to,"
8694,B,There is no really recycling facilities.
8695,A,No.
8696,A,"We have a pilot program in Arlington going on I think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as, the trash as they put it out."
8697,B,I think that is a good idea.
8698,A,And I think that is what it is going to have to come to. Where we are just forced to.
8699,B,"Besides, well like a law or whatever."
8700,B,that's how it is in New York isn't it.
8701,A,Yeah.
8702,A,"I think so,"
8703,A,"just because they have to. You know,"
8704,B,Uh-huh.
8705,B,And you get ticketed if you don't do it right.
8706,A,"Right,"
8707,A,uh-huh.
8708,A,"And I think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the,"
8709,A,"it's, It's trouble for me to do what I do"
8710,B,Yeah.
8711,A,"I mean, I am willing to do it"
8712,A,"but,"
8713,B,Plus you have to have a place to store all of it
8714,A,Yeah.
8715,B,and see I live in an apartment.
8716,A,Yeah.
8717,A,It is very difficult.
8718,A,Like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers
8719,A,"and, so, I don't know."
8720,A,I think there needs to be more places
8721,A,and also I have a real strong opinion.
8722,A,"In Iowa, the state I am from uh, I believe it has gone up to a dollar now."
8723,B,Uh-huh.
8724,A,"Every time you buy a container, no matter what it is, whether it is glass, whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever, you pay ten cents for it"
8725,B,Yeah.
8726,A,and then you take it back to the store
8727,A,and you get it back.
8728,B,"Uh, so that way it kind of forces you to recycle."
8729,A,You are forced to.
8730,A,"And, uh, you also don't see the litter there."
8731,A,"People just,"
8732,B,"Yeah,"
8733,B,that's true.
8734,A,It makes it worthwhile to take it back
8735,A,"and I've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian,"
8736,A,I don't know if you've tried it
8737,B,"Yeah,"
8738,B,I have seen them.
8739,A,"and they have on the it's five cents, that they pay five cents"
8740,B,Uh-huh.
8741,A,"and it even shows the states that,"
8742,B,That take them back.
8743,A,Yeah.
8744,A,"Well, some of them are five, some are ten cents."
8745,A,I am looking at it right now.
8746,B,Is Texas one of them?
8747,A,Texas is not one of them see.
8748,A,"So, I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass."
8749,B,Yeah.
8750,B,"No,"
8751,B,I don't think that there is enough being done.
8752,B,"Now, I work at J C PENNY at their corporate headquarters."
8753,A,Uh-huh.
8754,B,"And we have a paper recycling program that, uh, is company wide"
8755,B,and I do the recycling for that.
8756,A,Do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper.
8757,B,Yeah.
8758,A,Good.
8759,A,Because there is a lot of waste there isn't there.
8760,B,Yeah.
8761,B,And I know there is a lot of computer paper that you can't use.
8762,A,Right.
8763,A,Right.
8764,B,"But, uh, we use to have, uh,"
8765,B,"I mean, I don't even remember how much money that they've, uh, I mean, the money that they've made from the recycling program."
8766,B,They have donated it to charities.
8767,A,Right.
8768,B,I mean they have made a substantial amount of money from it.
8769,A,Yeah.
8770,A,Something else I think we do can do is support companies that encourage
8771,A,"like, I have decided Downy Fabric Softener now has where you can buy a little carton"
8772,B,Yeah.
8773,A,you add
8774,A,"well, I image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later,"
8775,A,but I am going to stick with Downey because they were first.
8776,B,Yeah.
8777,A,And I want them to have my business.
8778,A,And I think packaging could be done much better.
8779,A,There is so much plastic.
8780,A,"But,"
8781,B,"Well I know,"
8782,B,you see some of the stuff
8783,B,"and then when they come out with the new things, you are like, well why didn't you think of that before."
8784,A,Yeah.
8785,A,Yeah.
8786,A,And I think that it's just people have got to be aware.
8787,A,"Unfortunately, there are a lot of people that just don't care"
8788,A,and they don't want to think about it.
8789,B,"Yeah,"
8790,B,that's true.
8791,A,"And, uh, I just look at it, I don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something."
8792,A,"You know, I want to feel like I at least tried."
8793,B,Yeah.
8794,A,And I don't know.
8795,A,It just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it.
8796,A,Then we will be forced to.
8797,A,It may be too late.
8798,B,"Do they not ever, I mean, I don't know that much. Do they not ever burn trash or anything like,"
8799,A,Very little.
8800,A,"That's another thing that,"
8801,A,"see there were no,"
8802,B,"Then, that's pollution."
8803,A,I know Amway.
8804,A,I use a couple of things from Amway that it says this is burnable material.
8805,A,"Well, that doesn't do me any good because I don't have any place to burn it."
8806,B,"Yeah,"
8807,B,I know.
8808,B,I guess you run into the pollution factor.
8809,A,Yeah.
8810,A,"And then just like the glass bottles, that it says on the bottle I can get ten cents, but not in Texas."
8811,B,Yeah.
8812,A,And there is no place I can take glass to.
8813,B,"Uh,"
8814,A,"So, I still throw away a lot of glass."
8815,B,It is really sad.
8816,A,Yeah.
8817,A,And then the packaging thing really grips me.
8818,A,You buy some
8819,A,"and it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic,"
8820,B,"Well, uh, I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in, in specific, uh, very specific in this, uh, very specific examples such as, uh, transportation workers, as in, uh, air traffic controllers, bus drivers and that kind of thing."
8821,A,Well.
8822,B,"Um, I don't really think that it's, uh, too many,"
8823,B,"I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say, well, we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're, uh, you know, worthy of working for us."
8824,B,"I really don't see that that's a very, very valid, uh, thing for a company to say,"
8825,B,"and I, personally, I don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body."
8826,A,"Yeah,"
8827,A,"uh, I guess I basically agree that, uh,"
8828,A,do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs?
8829,A,I mean suppose they found out some other way?
8830,B,"Well, I think, I think we, I think the problem here is, is that a, a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs."
8831,A,Yeah.
8832,B,"There's too many cases where it can, you know,"
8833,B,"there can be false positive results, and that, that sort of thing."
8834,B,"I don't think there's any definitive, you know,"
8835,B,"okay this person is taking drugs,"
8836,B,so we don't want him here.
8837,A,Yeah.
8838,B,"Uh, like I said, some industries, though, I think it'd be very necessary,"
8839,B,I wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I'm flying in an airplane.
8840,A,Yeah.
8841,B,"But, uh, I, I just, I find it to be pretty offensive that, that it's such a, a big deal."
8842,B,"I mean, if your employer's not going to trust you"
8843,B,"or, you know, it,"
8844,B,"I just, I think it's a whole trust issue."
8845,B,I just can't see it.
8846,A,"But, have you ever been in a situation where you, you were drug tested"
8847,A,"or,"
8848,B,"Uh, yeah,"
8849,B,I have been.
8850,A,Yeah.
8851,B,"I.  I mean, I was very offended by, by the whole process."
8852,A,"I once too,"
8853,A,so.
8854,A,Yeah.
8855,B,"I mean it's very humiliating,"
8856,B,"and, I mean, I'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs,"
8857,B,"but I, uh, I am totally against that sort of a, uh,"
8858,B,"I mean it's, it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want to look at your urine before I'm going to talk to you."
8859,A,Yeah.
8860,A,"I had it during a job interview,"
8861,A,"and I just thought it was dumb of the company, at a point where they were trying to convince me to, to want to work for them to do this,"
8862,B,Right.
8863,A,"and I'm just like, well, uh, I'm not even going to think much about it if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before you've gotten to know me."
8864,B,Yeah.
8865,B,Right.
8866,B,Right.
8867,B,"That's, that's basically my opinion on it, right there, is that it's just, you know,"
8868,B,"I did, I, I was in the same sort of situation as,"
8869,B,it was a job interview
8870,B,"and then you had a physical, where you were drug tested,"
8871,B,"and it's,"
8872,B,"I just,"
8873,B,"and I know people who have been drug tested and who have not, you know, been hired by a corporation which, uh, you know,"
8874,B,I really.
8875,B,"The other side of it is, is, besides its being an invasion of personal privacy, as in my, it's my bodily fluid"
8876,B,"and I don't really want you to look at it, or or something pretty basic like that,"
8877,A,Uh-huh.
8878,B,just to the fact that I don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they're not at work.
8879,B,"I mean, during the eight hours, during the day, when they're supposed to be there, I think they have every right to say this is, these behaviors are acceptable and these are not,"
8880,B,"but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work, I find that to be fairly offensive also."
8881,A,"Yeah,"
8882,A,"well like you say, I mean, if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt, then really what people ought to be doing, I mean, the, the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors."
8883,B,Right.
8884,B,Right.
8885,A,"And, I mean, if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem, then they'll notice it for other reasons."
8886,B,That's exactly right.
8887,A,Yeah.
8888,B,"And also I just think it, it gets a lot,"
8889,B,"I'm a big, uh, supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies,"
8890,B,"and I think that it just moves down along a line that, that I really would find bad if, if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work, you know,"
8891,B,"there's already talk of people,"
8892,B,"well, we're not going to hire you if you smoke."
8893,B,"Well, you know, I, I can see how they can say in the work place we, you don't want them to smoke,"
8894,B,"but when somebody leaves work, I don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all."
8895,A,"Well, do you think it's, should be illegal for an employer to do this"
8896,A,"or,"
8897,B,"Uh, I really think it should be, except as I've mentioned twice now, in the specified industries or, or jobs, because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times."
8898,A,Yeah.
8899,B,"And other than that I think, I do not think it should be allowable."
8900,B,"I think it should be illegal for them to, to want to do that."
8901,B,"It should, it's kind of the big brother syndrome,"
8902,B,"I mean, I just,"
8903,B,anything like that just kind of scares me.
8904,A,"I tend to, to view it,"
8905,A,"even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that, I sort of want to defend an employer's rights as opposed to an uh, in addition to an individual's rights,"
8906,A,"but an employer, really, I think, has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to"
8907,B,Right.
8908,A,"and if they say they don't want smokers, I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that."
8909,B,Right.
8910,A,"Uh, and I don't really,"
8911,B,Okay.
8912,A,"Okay,"
8913,A,"I thought it was supposed to give a recording,"
8914,A,"but anyway, uh, well, I do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for, for my wife and for me"
8915,A,"and uh, I, embarrassed to say, it's pretty trivial."
8916,B,Uh-huh.
8917,A,"All we, all I do is, uh, keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month,"
8918,A,but I doubt I do it more than three times a year.
8919,B,"Uh-huh,"
8920,B,do you use a computer?
8921,A,"And,"
8922,A,"No,"
8923,A,"I work with them all day,"
8924,A,"I'm in computer science,"
8925,A,yet I I do everything on paper
8926,B,Oh.
8927,B,Uh-huh.
8928,A,"Uh, I don't even use a calculator for the stuff I'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers."
8929,B,"Yeah,"
8930,B,"mine is really simple, because I got all our bills paid off when, uh, he was a Marine,"
8931,B,he went to Saudi Arabia
8932,B,"and while he was gone I got all of our bills paid off,"
8933,B,"so really the only bills I have is rent, utilities, insurance you know,"
8934,A,Uh-huh.
8935,B,"so they come in,"
8936,B,"I pay them,"
8937,B,"and that's it you know,"
8938,B,"that's about the extent of it, you know."
8939,A,Yeah
8940,A,"that,"
8941,B,I don't really have this major budget or anything.
8942,B,"I just really, I'm real thrifty."
8943,B,"I take care of, you know, two children and me and uh, just real careful with the money, you know. What little we have"
8944,A,Uh-huh.
8945,B,"so, that's what I do."
8946,A,"Yes,"
8947,A,it's pretty straightforward.
8948,A,It's
8949,A,"I can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making you know, fancy budgets."
8950,B,No.
8951,A,"It seems like if you're getting to that level, you're not in real good control."
8952,B,Uh-uh.
8953,B,"You know, I mean, I, I, I've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt, you know,"
8954,A,Uh-huh
8955,B,you buy something on credit
8956,A,Uh-huh.
8957,B,and you pay twice as much for it when you get done. You know
8958,A,Yeah.
8959,B,"so,"
8960,A,"Actually, I mean, I like using credit cards for everything, but just paying off the bills because that way it's a record of everything"
8961,B,Uh-huh.
8962,A,and I don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month.
8963,B,"I don't have too many, I don't have too many weaknesses,"
8964,B,"but I found out a credit card was one of them. You know,"
8965,A,Uh.
8966,B,"it's so much easy, easier, you know, if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person,"
8967,B,"it's like, oh, it's on sale,"
8968,B,"let's go grab it, you know"
8969,B,"so, uh, and if you don't have the money, then use a credit card,"
8970,B,"so, I got rid of them credit cards. You know."
8971,A,"Yeah, I guess if that's if that's a weakness, that's a good thing to do."
8972,B,"Yeah,"
8973,B,that was my weakness
8974,B,"It wasn't bad,"
8975,B,"I mean, I didn't have like thousands of dollars, you know, and like that,"
8976,B,"just, I just learned that that wasn't for me, you know."
8977,A,Uh-huh.
8978,A,Sure.
8979,B,"So, but I, self-employed, you know,"
8980,B,"I have my own little cleaning business type thing,"
8981,B,"so, uh, I keep,"
8982,A,Do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that
8983,A,"or,"
8984,B,"No,"
8985,B,"it's not hard,"
8986,B,"I just keep it in a notebook and write down what I've made and, uh, you know, what it's going to have to go for that month"
8987,B,"and you know, it's not that, not that hard. Not at all."
8988,A,Uh-huh.
8989,A,"Well, that's good to know."
8990,B,"So, I always do my own income tax, you know."
8991,A,Yeah.
8992,B,Do you?
8993,A,"I don't understand the idea of paying somebody to, to do it."
8994,B,Huh?
8995,A,It seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it.
8996,B,"all you got to do is read a book, I mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go."
8997,A,"I,"
8998,A,"Yeah,"
8999,A,just the form.
9000,A,Yeah.
9001,B,"I mean, it seems absurd that people will pay, you know, some bucks just to get someone to,"
9002,A,"Yeah,"
9003,A,and a lot of them.
9004,B,it's dumb
9005,B,"I guess if you had some really complicated stuff,"
9006,B,"but I don't,"
9007,B,"so, I don't mess with it."
9008,A,Yeah.
9009,B,"But, I don't use a calculator either, you know"
9010,A,"I, I don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer, too much stuff like that because I want to make sure that, that I, I keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on."
9011,B,"I don't, I don't have that that many, you know, things to add up"
9012,B,"so,"
9013,A,I know too many people who use a calculator
9014,A,"if they make a mistake, they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention."
9015,B,"Oh, yeah."
9016,A,"And,  And it seem,"
9017,B,"And we have a,"
9018,B,I bank at N C N B here
9019,B,"and they have a number that you can call in,"
9020,B,"and I always call in and, like, once every other week or so"
9021,B,"and I will, uh, check off what checks have cleared"
9022,B,"and,"
9023,A,Yeah.
9024,B,Do you do that?
9025,A,We have the same thing.
9026,B,You do too?
9027,A,Yeah.
9028,B,"And I always check them off and, you know, check my balance and my book and, you know, because I always want to know exactly what I have, you know."
9029,A,Sure.
9030,B,I do that real often.
9031,B,"I do that,"
9032,B,"so anyway,"
9033,A,"Okay,"
9034,A,"so, what are, what are your views on capital punishment?"
9035,B,I have ambivalent feelings because I don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is.
9036,B,"But, on the other hand, it is very, very expensive to maintain,"
9037,B,"you know, Texas has one of biggest criminal justice systems in the country."
9038,A,Yes.
9039,B,And it's eating us alive budget wise
9040,B,"and, uh,"
9041,A,So are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state?
9042,B,"Yes,"
9043,B,"we do practice capital punishment,"
9044,B,"but the nature of the, uh, courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed."
9045,A,"Yes,"
9046,A,that's similar to Georgia.
9047,B,Yeah.
9048,B,"And then, I was reading in the paper just this morning, it's interesting because I had forgotten, I guess, that I wrote this little topic down, that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them. Because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know."
9049,A,"That's probably true considering,"
9050,A,Yes.
9051,A,"Yes,"
9052,A,"uh, I guess in a way that, it, it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if,"
9053,B,"Well, I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people. You know, who would see it."
9054,A,Yes.
9055,A,"Right,"
9056,A,that would be the intent of it.
9057,B,"Yeah,"
9058,B,but I'm not sure how successful that is.
9059,A,"Well, I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner, if there weren't so many  appeals."
9060,B,"Quicker  maybe,"
9061,B,yeah.
9062,A,"Yeah,"
9063,A,"if, if the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely, possibly capital punishment,"
9064,B,Uh-huh.
9065,B,"What, what kind of work do you do?"
9066,A,"Uh, I'm a research engineer,"
9067,A,"I work, uh, with Georgia Tech."
9068,B,"Um, well, see, I'm a school principal."
9069,A,Um.
9070,B,Elementary school.
9071,A,Yes.
9072,B,And in a very poor section of town with predominantly Anglo kids.
9073,B,And I see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do
9074,A,Um.
9075,B,"and, see, I'm afraid I think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people, that,"
9076,B,"I mean, course, you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there"
9077,A,Uh-huh.
9078,B,"but I think we would make a bigger investment in kids,"
9079,B,"we'd have fewer decisions to make. Down the road, you know."
9080,A,"Um, that's probably true,"
9081,A,"but I guess there's other factors that,"
9082,B,"Oh, yeah."
9083,A,"But, pumping more money into the school system is a good thing,"
9084,B,Well I'm not talking about just in the school system.
9085,A,"but it's not going to,"
9086,A,"Oh, I see."
9087,B,"See, I'm talking about,"
9088,B,"like, in, in,"
9089,B,"uh, I'm afraid I think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared."
9090,B,"Uh, I know the institutions don't work that well,"
9091,B,but a bad day because I all these kids through my office.
9092,B,I have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids.
9093,A,Uh-huh.
9094,B,"Five hundred of them are good, solid kids"
9095,B,and I have the same thirty-seven in my office every day.
9096,A,Um.
9097,B,And a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible.
9098,B,Some of them in the penal system.
9099,A,So that's a difficult situation.
9100,B,"And, you know, you just see those kids going down the road."
9101,B,"Now, not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment,"
9102,B,"but some of them have already been in youth centers. And that kind of thing,"
9103,A,Um.
9104,B,"and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals,"
9105,B,"and I'm not talking about necessarily in the school system,"
9106,B,I'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action.
9107,A,Uh-huh.
9108,B,"I think that's one reason we have problems in schools, uh,"
9109,B,"and some of them are our problems,"
9110,B,"but a lot of it's because everything society wants, we are supposed to do."
9111,A,Uh-huh.
9112,B,But that's another subject
9113,B,"but,"
9114,A,"Well, that's probably true."
9115,B,"Anyway, I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has, making a decision what to do with them."
9116,A,"Um, yeah,"
9117,A,I guess that's not an easy solution.
9118,A,"There's, there's no easy solution for that."
9119,B,Uh-huh.
9120,B,"I don't, I don't know that there is an easy solution,"
9121,B,"but if you could find a way to prevent some of it, and I'm not sure what it would be. It would be money better spent than,"
9122,A,Uh-huh.
9123,B,do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard?
9124,B,That's true.
9125,A,"I'm sure it is,"
9126,A,yeah.
9127,B,"Statistically, that's true."
9128,A,"Um, yeah,"
9129,A,"I don't, I don't,"
9130,A,certainly capital punishment isn't going to solve a lot of problems
9131,B,Uh-huh.
9132,A,"but,"
9133,B,Are you for it?
9134,A,"Uh,"
9135,B,I'm for it in  in some cases.
9136,A,I guess I am  for certain
9137,B,Yeah.
9138,A,"yeah,"
9139,A,in certain crimes.
9140,B,What kind of crimes would you use it for?
9141,A,"Uh, premeditated murder. Crimes of that nature, I think should definitely,"
9142,B,Uh-huh.
9143,A,any mass murderer type individual.
9144,B,"I, I would consider it for sexual abuse of children, on going. You know, not one instance, but perpetual abusers of children."
9145,A,Um.
9146,A,Uh-huh.
9147,A,"Well, you always have castration"
9148,B,"Well, you know, somebody elected that recently."
9149,A,"Yes,"
9150,A,I read about that
9151,B,"And all the civil rights people are up arms about it, you know."
9152,A,Uh-huh.
9153,B,"But, uh,"
9154,A,Okay.
9155,A,"Well, um, I used to work in a day care center."
9156,B,Uh-huh.
9157,A,"I worked in, um, in all the different areas of the day care center"
9158,A,"and it is, they can be deceiving to people."
9159,A,"I did not work there long because I couldn't handle the, the treatment that the children got,"
9160,A,"and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three, um, centers,  all over, you know, the, um, city"
9161,B,Uh-huh.
9162,A,"and they would, um, be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left."
9163,B,Yeah.
9164,A,"So, um, I think you need to make, you know, if you do, do day care centers, you know you should make frequent checks and, um, to check in on them when they're not expecting it."
9165,B,Yeah.
9166,A,"Because they do, do things differently when you're not around,"
9167,A,so.
9168,B,"Well that,"
9169,B,I know
9170,B,"the things that we kind of looked at is, is you want to see how many teachers you have. And, and how many kids they have and how they break it up."
9171,A,Uh-huh.
9172,A,Right.
9173,B,"Because we had, we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in."
9174,A,Uh-huh.
9175,B,"It, it was a really good one,"
9176,B,"and in fact, it worked out for us because my wife, we kind of bartered."
9177,B,My wife did artwork for them
9178,B,"and then, you know, so we got our day care free."
9179,A,Uh-huh.
9180,B,But they didn't have enough teachers
9181,B,"and,"
9182,A,"Well, this one was set up good."
9183,A,"I mean they had two teachers to every room. Um, sometimes three."
9184,B,Uh-huh.
9185,A,"And they had a good system like so when you walked in, everything looks cool."
9186,B,Uh-huh.
9187,A,The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough.
9188,A,They did not show them care to these small children who are being left.
9189,B,Uh-huh.
9190,A,"Um, they,"
9191,A,one time I picked up this little boy who was crying
9192,A,"and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other. You know,"
9193,B,Huh.
9194,A,he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up.
9195,A,"And I said, no,"
9196,A,"this child was crying and needed some comfort, you know,"
9197,B,Yeah.
9198,A,what is your problem.
9199,A,"So, um,"
9200,B,"Did, did they separate them by age group?"
9201,A,Yes.
9202,B,"Because I'd think, you know, I think that's one thing that was important."
9203,A,Right.
9204,A,"They did, they had like, um, the, the crawlers, the babies that didn't walk in one room. The ones that were starting to walk in one room."
9205,B,Uh-huh.
9206,A,"Then they had like the, um, three, three year olds, upper fours, lower fours, upper fives, lower fives. You know, just like that."
9207,B,Yeah.
9208,A,"You know, they really did separate them well."
9209,B,"it sound,"
9210,B,"yeah,"
9211,A,It was just the teachers themselves.
9212,A,Right.
9213,A,"But,"
9214,A,"yeah,"
9215,A,"that they're not,"
9216,B,"Affectionate people that they're, they're kind of  may be parents themselves or something."
9217,A,Yeah.
9218,A,"Their system,"
9219,A,Right.
9220,A,"But their, but their system was, was great"
9221,A,"but, um, the, you know, the caring just wasn't there."
9222,B,Uh-huh.
9223,A,The one woman that taught that did the babies. I worked with her
9224,A,and she was fabulous.
9225,B,Uh-huh.
9226,A,"She loved them babies,"
9227,A,and she loved them and cared for them.
9228,A,"But, um, every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and, um, you know, would make me a nervous wreck,"
9229,A,"so, you know."
9230,B,Yeah.
9231,B,"I, I, I think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D's and all that kind of thing and, you know, know all the technical stuff,"
9232,B,"but if they don't reach out and touch the kids, then that doesn't do any good."
9233,A,"Yeah,"
9234,A,"these kids are just in a day care center all day and, uh, with no, any type of emotional, you know, getting love, getting care,"
9235,B,Yeah.
9236,A,"they're just there. You know. Going through this routine,  which is lousy."
9237,B,Yeah.
9238,B,"The other, the other group that we had was kind of interesting."
9239,B,"The other one we went to the, it was a husband and wife team"
9240,A,Uh-huh.
9241,B,and we knew them from other associations
9242,B,"but, uh, it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one,"
9243,B,"and I think, you know, she would, she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff, you know,"
9244,B,"but he was actually the more, um, the more, uh, what, demonstrative type. The more loving"
9245,A,Uh-huh.
9246,B,"he would, you know, laugh with the kids and play with the kids"
9247,B,"and and it was kind of interesting to see that, that it was actually the man in the group that, that did that side of it."
9248,A,Uh-huh.
9249,A,"Yeah,"
9250,A,you don't see that much.
9251,B,"Yeah,"
9252,B,so they had a really nice balance.
9253,B,We liked that one.
9254,B,"In fact, it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something,"
9255,A,That's cute.
9256,B,"but they also did, they also did some of the teaching things"
9257,B,"and then they had, um, you know,"
9258,B,"obedience, obedience was important."
9259,A,"Yeah,"
9260,A,that has to be with a day care center.
9261,B,"And you know so they, you know, they used, uh, oh, I think they used the,"
9262,B,"you probably heard where, you know, where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself."
9263,A,I've never heard of that.
9264,A,"That's, that's a new one,  on me."
9265,B,"And it's, it's one,"
9266,B,"Uh, I can't remember what they call it actually"
9267,B,but you just stand them in front of a clock
9268,B,"and, you know, it has a second-hand that goes around."
9269,A,Uh-huh.
9270,B,"And they have to stand there,"
9271,A,"Um, what's our topic?"
9272,B,Taxes.
9273,A,Taxes.
9274,B,Do we pay too much?
9275,A,Right.
9276,A,Right.
9277,A,Um
9278,B,"Well, do we?"
9279,A,What do you do?
9280,B,"Um,"
9281,A,"I guess that,"
9282,A,I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in.
9283,B,"My tax bracket is, is pretty high up there."
9284,B,"I pay the, I generally pay the maximum tax bracket."
9285,A,Uh-huh.
9286,B,"And, uh, I think that we're paying too much"
9287,B,because I don't have any children.
9288,A,Right.
9289,B,And I pay a lot of property taxes.
9290,A,"Oh, sure."
9291,B,"I don't have any, um, I don't, you know, I don't use an awful lot of city services."
9292,B,"It, it, you know it's like I have to work I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes."
9293,A,Uh-huh.
9294,A,Uh-huh.
9295,A,Right.
9296,B,"And, um, there's so many people who want a, a of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is"
9297,A,Uh-huh.
9298,B,"and I just,"
9299,B,"sometimes, many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes."
9300,A,Right.
9301,B,How about you?
9302,B,Do you pay too much?
9303,A,"Uh, well, no,"
9304,A,I can't really complain.
9305,A,"I'm a student, um,"
9306,A,"and I I work as a co-op at, uh, Georgia Tech Research Institute."
9307,A,"And, uh, I'm going to get back most of what I earned, I mean most of what I pay in taxes"
9308,A,"and, uh, and, uh,  one of my parents is still claiming me."
9309,B,"Well, when you  when you go out into the, uh, when you go out into the working world it, it changes quickly."
9310,A,Huh?
9311,A,Uh-huh.
9312,A,I'm sure
9313,B,"Um, you look at your paycheck"
9314,B,"and you go, oh, my gosh where did it all go"
9315,B,"Um, what kind of, what kind of,"
9316,B,"uh, well have you pay a lot of in"
9317,B,have you been out working and then gone back to school
9318,B,"or are you, did you go directly from high school into, into college?"
9319,A,"I went,"
9320,A,"well I did work, um, just very for some time"
9321,A,"but I didn't make enough money to really make,  too much of a difference."
9322,B,To worry about it.
9323,A,Right.
9324,B,"Have you, have you been active in, in politics trying to, concerning this?"
9325,B,Have you like worked on political action committees or something like that?
9326,A,"No,"
9327,A,"no,"
9328,A,I haven't.
9329,B,"I, uh, I haven't done any of that type of work myself."
9330,A,Uh-huh.
9331,B,"Um, but every once in a while when I hear up here at, at, uh, in D C area, um, one of the radio stations has been talking about the, the Congress,"
9332,B,"um, Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there, you know,"
9333,B,"there's a bank that they all bank with,"
9334,B,and I guess it went defunct recently.
9335,A,Uh-huh.
9336,B,"And one of the Congressmen has, has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks."
9337,A,Huh.
9338,B,"And we, we the taxpayers float him a loan for all all those bad checks,  no interest, no repayment schedule."
9339,A,Oh.
9340,A,Really?
9341,B,"And, um, it's causing quite a stir up here,  because we're so close to D C anyway."
9342,A,Uh-huh.
9343,A,Uh-huh.
9344,B,It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur.
9345,A,"Oh, sure."
9346,B,"Um, I, I, I think we pay too much."
9347,B,"And I've, I look at my paycheck"
9348,B,"and I make,"
9349,B,"well, let's see."
9350,B,They take out in state and federal taxes
9351,A,Uh-huh.
9352,B,I think I pay forty-two percent.
9353,A,Wow.
9354,B,"Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government,"
9355,B,and then they charge me sales tax
9356,B,"and they charge me gasoline taxes,"
9357,A,Uh-huh.
9358,A,taxes.
9359,B,"and they charge me all these others,"
9360,B,and it's just too expensive.
9361,A,Uh-huh.
9362,B,I can't believe that
9363,B,"I, I'm just thankful that I don't get all the government that I pay for."
9364,A,Huh.
9365,B,You know what I mean?
9366,A,Yeah.
9367,B,"Do you, have you used, um, student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government?"
9368,A,"No,"
9369,A,"no,"
9370,A,I haven't.
9371,A,"Uh, I, uh, my father pays for my, my schooling, my tuition."
9372,A,"So, uh, I'm, I haven't made use of that."
9373,B,What are you studying down there?
9374,A,Physics.
9375,B,Physics.
9376,A,Uh-huh.
9377,B,"Oh, that sounds like a fun, fun field."
9378,A,Everybody says that
9379,B,Scientific.
9380,A,Huh.
9381,B,Heavy science.
9382,B,"Are you like in the particle, particle research or anything like that"
9383,B,"or is it more, um, applied physics?"
9384,A,"Um, I haven't, I haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet."
9385,A,"Actually, um, the, the degree I'm getting is physics."
9386,A,There's a different one for applied physics
9387,A,so I guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied.
9388,B,Okay.
9389,B,"Well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's, come rolling towards, whatever it's rolling toward."
9390,A,I doubt about that.
9391,A,"Are, are, is America, I mean are we pretty, pretty steep compared to most countries?"
9392,B,"Actually, I don't think we are."
9393,A,"No,"
9394,A,I don't think so either.
9395,B,"Um, like, like Europe,  um, England. I know the taxes are a lot higher."
9396,A,Uh-huh.
9397,A,Uh-huh.
9398,A,Uh-huh.
9399,B,But they do have socialized medicine and things like that.
9400,A,Yeah.
9401,B,"And, um, I know I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that, um, they're talking,"
9402,B,or maybe it was on the
9403,A,I don't think anybody pays too little.
9404,B,"No,"
9405,B,I would tend to agree very highly.
9406,B,I think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it.
9407,A,Do you get hit up for local taxes there?
9408,B,"Yeah,"
9409,B,we sure do.
9410,B,"Here in Indiana we pay, uh, we pay county income tax, state income tax,"
9411,B,"we pay five percent sales tax,"
9412,B,"uh, you name it, they tax it."
9413,A,"Oh, so you get the whole smorgasbord."
9414,B,That's right
9415,B,"we,"
9416,A,"Well, I, I actually live in New Hampshire tax free or die. Uh-huh"
9417,B,Uh-huh.
9418,B,Right.
9419,B,"Which is probably pretty nice,"
9420,B,but I'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high.
9421,A,"No,"
9422,A,actually there's no sales tax in New Hampshire either.
9423,B,There's no sales tax either?
9424,A,"No,"
9425,A,"what there is, is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything."
9426,B,Uh-huh.
9427,A,"The only problem is I work in Massachusetts,"
9428,A,so they they hit me up for the five percent there.
9429,B,Right.
9430,B,Taxachusetts
9431,A,"Yep,"
9432,A,"but, it,"
9433,A,"well, you know, we,"
9434,A,"it's only a state tax here, no local."
9435,B,Uh-huh.
9436,A,got a five percent sales tax.
9437,B,Right.
9438,A,"But, uh, the problem is that so I'm paying state tax even if I don't live here."
9439,B,Right.
9440,A,"But, at least on things like stock options and things like that, they don't tax me."
9441,B,Uh-huh.
9442,A,So that's not too bad.
9443,B,"No,"
9444,B,"I, uh, I really think that, here in Indiana at least we pay a, a whole, uh, just too much tax."
9445,B,"I worked in a factory, uh, last summer"
9446,B,"and, on the average, I was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes"
9447,B,and I don't feel that I really get a whole lot of return from that.
9448,B,"I mean, I don't utilize all, you know, it really, any government welfare services."
9449,B,"Of course, I drive on the roads"
9450,B,"and I, you know, went to the schools and stuff,"
9451,B,"but I really feel that, that I'm just getting overtaxed."
9452,A,"Oh, I, I mean, I, I'd consider twenty percent lucky because just on, I mean, you know, when you figure out just on feds, you know, I actually hit the thirty-one bracket  this year, which was no fun."
9453,B,Uh-huh.
9454,B,No
9455,B,"that's, that's not any fun."
9456,A,"Right,"
9457,A,"and also, you know, then you figure out seven or eight percent for F I C A which is taxes where"
9458,B,Uh-huh.
9459,B,Right.
9460,A,"most people forget about them, because you've you know, you can't always get your F I C A back at the end of the year."
9461,B,Right.
9462,A,"But, so, you know, and then, you know, like a five percent surtax, I'm paying forty percent tax."
9463,B,"Yeah,"
9464,B,which is just outrageous
9465,B,"and a lot of it,"
9466,B,"and if you look at the way the government is run these days, it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste."
9467,A,"Yeah,"
9468,A,"well, I, I mean, I think there's some people, there, certainly are some things where you need infrastructure"
9469,A,"and you need you you know,"
9470,B,Right.
9471,A,"things government does better, you know,"
9472,A,"I government does a better space program than you're going to get out of private individuals,"
9473,B,Right.
9474,A,"but, you know, I think, you know, you look at things like, you know, tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way"
9475,B,Right
9476,A,"or, You know, and, and just tremendous amounts of, you know,"
9477,B,"That's right,"
9478,B,got to keep those farmers happy.
9479,A,"so much of it, is now just going to service debt or you know, is going in, into, into programs that, you know,"
9480,B,Uh-huh.
9481,A,"yeah,"
9482,A,"they are, they are a fat."
9483,A,"You know, I think the military is really fat."
9484,A,"I think that a lot of the, the H E W services, although they're providing necessary services, have too much fat in them."
9485,B,Right.
9486,B,there is just way too much bureaucracy
9487,B,"and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running, keep the paper shuffling around instead of real, you know, good programs."
9488,A,"You know, like we,"
9489,A,"Yeah,"
9490,A,"I mean, we, we spend a fortune for things like V A hospitals"
9491,A,"and, you know, then you look at how well they're managed, you know,"
9492,A,"I don't think we're getting our money's work out, worth out of there."
9493,A,"I think it's all going into, into bureaucrats."
9494,B,"Right,"
9495,B,and a lot of it's feeding that.
9496,B,"Just, I just, I really, especially in the election year, I mean, I'm really thinking a lot about this, the economy and questions like that and, and just the whole,"
9497,B,"it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy, uh, the government goes and our, our whole economy in general"
9498,B,and our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens
9499,B,"and especially when you've got the Bush administration who has increased government expenditures, uh, beyond what any other President since World War Two has done"
9500,B,"and yet he supposedly,"
9501,A,"Well, between him and Reagan,"
9502,A,yeah.
9503,B,Right
9504,B,"right,"
9505,B,yeah.
9506,A,great
9507,B,"I mean, I just read something that, two thirds or three quarters, I'm not exactly sure of our national debt are, was created during the Reagan Bush era  who are supposedly fiscally conservative."
9508,A,"Oh, oh, yeah,"
9509,A,"they think,"
9510,A,"Oh, yeah,"
9511,A,and then they go I'm not
9512,A,"Congress, they're the fault for it."
9513,B,Right
9514,A,"But, you know, the other thing is, it's tricky, though,"
9515,A,"because like in New Hampshire, they say, oh, all right, let's cut the military budget."
9516,B,Right.
9517,A,"Well, yeah,"
9518,A,"then, you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire"
9519,B,Uh-huh.
9520,A,"you lose,"
9521,A,"Connecticut goes,"
9522,A,"so, you know, it's like, you know, it's very tricky to balance off, because then you hurt, you know,"
9523,A,"if the, if the, if people lose their jobs, then they become a load"
9524,A,and they're not contributing taxes.
9525,B,That's right.
9526,A,"So, you know, it's, it's very hard to say, you know, this is what we should cut."
9527,B,"Yeah,"
9528,B,"it's really,"
9529,B,"that is the,"
9530,B,"especially that defense, cuts in the defense is really a Catch twenty-two double whammy, because like you say, if you cut defense, well, that's great,"
9531,B,"that's going to lower our national expenditures,"
9532,B,but then you're going to have people on welfare
9533,B,and they're not  putting taxes in.
9534,A,Who aren't contributing.
9535,A,"Right,"
9536,A,yeah.
9537,B,"So that's, that's really,"
9538,B,"it's,"
9539,A,"And, uh, in our,"
9540,B,I'm glad I'm not the one who has to come up with these policies.
9541,A,Right.
9542,A,"But, what's very funny is in our town meeting they were"
9543,A,"this, this guy had, both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which, unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution for our local town to do it to, uh, have you, have people line item their taxes."
9544,B,Uh-huh.
9545,B,Right.
9546,A,They say I want to pay for this and this and this and this and this.
9547,A,"Course, the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they don't use."
9548,B,That's right.
9549,A,Yeah.
9550,A,"the one will take,"
9551,A,"uh, okay,"
9552,A,"let's see,"
9553,A,"I guess, uh, I can start."
9554,A,"I'm actually, we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing."
9555,B,Are you really?
9556,A,Yeah.
9557,A,"Uh, so I'm looking at, uh, something larger than what we have."
9558,A,"We've got, like, an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and a, uh, an eighty-nine Horizon."
9559,A,"So, I'm looking for something, uh, littler  bigger,"
9560,B,"Uh-huh,"
9561,B,which are both kind of small.
9562,A,yeah.
9563,A,"Uh, so we were thinking mini van for a while"
9564,A,"and, uh, we're looking at, uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans as well."
9565,B,Uh-huh.
9566,B,Are you looking for an American car
9567,B,"or, you open to buying foreign cars?"
9568,A,"Uh, I don't really have a preference either way I guess. You know,"
9569,B,Uh-huh.
9570,A,"it's, you know, it,"
9571,A,I guess the American cars had a bad reputation
9572,A,but I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had.
9573,B,Uh-huh.
9574,B,Right.
9575,B,"Personally, I have a Japanese car right now,"
9576,B,and I really like it a lot.
9577,B,"Uh, I think the Japanese really build good cars"
9578,A,Uh-huh.
9579,B,"and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole, uh, you know, buy American, keep American auto workers working right now,"
9580,B,"but I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our, uh, car manufacturers have for a while."
9581,A,Yeah.
9582,B,"If I were to buy another car, I would be, uh, I would be partial to buying another Japanese car,"
9583,B,"but I would also look at American cars,"
9584,B,"but when I bought the car that I bought now, I did that also"
9585,B,and I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product.
9586,A,"Yeah,"
9587,A,"I mean, even if it's just details, it seems like, uh they, you know,"
9588,B,"So, if I were,"
9589,B,Right.
9590,A,I
9591,A,there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal
9592,A,and you have to take it back every once in a while.
9593,A,"It's clearly just a, a design problem there."
9594,B,"Right,"
9595,B,it is.
9596,B,"Uh, I'm kind of,"
9597,B,"right now,"
9598,B,the next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car.
9599,B,I would really like to have a sports car.
9600,B,"Uh I don't really, I don't have a family,"
9601,B,"so I don't need a, a mini van or such to, uh, haul people around in."
9602,A,Uh-huh.
9603,B,"So I'm looking for more a, a two passenger car that, uh,"
9604,A,"Oh, like a Miata or something like that?"
9605,B,"Well, I like the Miata,"
9606,B,but I don't like it enough to buy it.
9607,B,"I would buy something,"
9608,B,"actually the, the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon, which is an American car."
9609,A,Um.
9610,B,"But, uh, something along that lines."
9611,B,"Uh, because I have a, an economy car right now, which is okay,"
9612,B,"but uh, I think I, I'd like to move on to something a little better."
9613,A,Yeah.
9614,A,interesting.
9615,A,"Yeah,"
9616,A,"I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for, you know, size and safety, and then mileage."
9617,B,Right.
9618,A,"Probably,"
9619,B,Right.
9620,A,"Uh,"
9621,B,"That's,"
9622,B,"when I bought the car that I bought, I was looking for mileage,"
9623,B,"and I was looking for, uh, dependability and something that was going to last a long time. I was that I would get a, for the money that I was going to spend, that I would get a return that was, that was worth that money."
9624,A,Yeah.
9625,B,"So,"
9626,A,Yeah
9627,A,"I I think in terms of computer terminology, I look at, you know, price performance and things like that.  And then a little bit at life expectancy, I guess,"
9628,B,"Right,"
9629,B,exactly.
9630,A,"but it, you know depends on what you, what you pay initially."
9631,B,Yeah.
9632,A,"But, you know I've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger."
9633,B,That's right.
9634,A,Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage
9635,B,Uh-huh.
9636,A,and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton.
9637,B,Uh-huh.
9638,A,"It's, you know,"
9639,A,"we, we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles,"
9640,A,"but uh, the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it,"
9641,B,Uh-huh.
9642,A,"so, But, uh,"
9643,B,Okay.
9644,B,"Uh, I've had, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think,"
9645,B,"and, and they were okay."
9646,B,I had a Pontiac once
9647,B,"and, and I never had a problem with it,"
9648,B,"but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point"
9649,B,"and I, I had driven it a few times"
9650,B,"and I really did not feel that it, that I would buy a Dodge just from,"
9651,A,Um.
9652,B,"well, actually, I had a, uh, a Dodge Omni at one point"
9653,A,Uh-huh.
9654,B,"and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car."
9655,A,Yeah.
9656,B,"So, I guess you'd have to say, if I was looking, I would definitely be looking for a foreign car."
9657,A,That's interesting.
9658,A,"But,"
9659,A,"yeah,"
9660,A,"it, it's hard to beat some of the,"
9661,A,"uh, like, I guess, in particular, we're looking at a, like a ninety-one Corsica, uh, buy back at a, they say G M sponsored auction,"
9662,A,"but I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after, you know, it's, after they've used it for six months and put you know, twelve or fifteen thousand miles, on it"
9663,B,Uh-huh.
9664,B,Right.
9665,A,"and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you,"
9666,B,Which is a good deal.
9667,A,"Yeah,"
9668,A,"because I guess, uh,"
9669,A,"I mean, well, ninety-twos, granted, but the new ones, you know"
9670,B,Uh-huh.
9671,A,"fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot,"
9672,B,Right.
9673,A,so all the depreciation has been taken off
9674,A,"and, the dealer comes out okay you know,"
9675,B,Yeah
9676,B,"that,"
9677,A,"don't what kind of, I don't know what G M corporate, kind of hit the, I don't know what kind of hit they take on it,"
9678,A,but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it
9679,A,"and So, but, uh, I don't know,"
9680,B,"Yeah,"
9681,B,I'm sure they did.
9682,A,we keep looking at that mini van.
9683,A,"It's just, you know,"
9684,A,"we can get a, like a Caravan for, twelve, five"
9685,B,Uh-huh.
9686,B,Right.
9687,A,but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now.
9688,A,"But, uh, uh, it's interesting,"
9689,A,"but, uh, I don't know,"
9690,A,"if, if, uh, it seems to be,"
9691,B,"Well, Julie, uh, are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with, uh, special care for elderly?"
9692,A,"Well, I don't know."
9693,A,My grandfather is ninety-two years old.
9694,B,Uh-huh.
9695,A,And he is still living by himself.
9696,A,My grandmother died a couple of years ago
9697,A,"But he doesn't want to, to move away."
9698,A,He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm.
9699,B,Uh-huh.
9700,A,And he recently had to have an operation
9701,A,but he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home.
9702,B,"Is he able to, uh, still do everything himself pretty well?"
9703,A,"Well, he was until this operation."
9704,A,He has arthritis.
9705,B,"Oh, yeah."
9706,A,And now I don't really think he's doing that well.
9707,A,"And my, a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him."
9708,A,And I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot.
9709,B,Yeah.
9710,A,"But, uh, my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three."
9711,B,Uh-huh.
9712,A,"And, uh, died six weeks after they put him in the home."
9713,B,Yeah.
9714,B,And I'm sure that kind of thing would influence your grandfather's feelings.
9715,B,"Because, uh, I you know, I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of, do they still have some of their life left."
9716,B,"And  and, for, for, I'm sure, a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over"
9717,A,Uh-huh.
9718,B,and I'm just here for the rest of the stay
9719,B,"And so I, you know, I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home, it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs."
9720,B,Yeah
9721,A,Uh-huh.
9722,B,they have can look after a lot of things
9723,B,but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore.
9724,B,"Uh, I know my, none of my grandparents were in a nursing home."
9725,B,They generally were able to have someone care for them at home
9726,B,and they died
9727,B,"But they were all, goodness, younger than your grandparents"
9728,B,Like they were in their eighties. That type of thing
9729,B,"Uh, but I did, uh, you know, I guess,"
9730,B,"uh, when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to do, take care of themselves physically. Uh"
9731,A,But I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job.
9732,B,"And that's, that's difficult part."
9733,B,"Because I think what they often get used as is, uh, almost like a very high level or long-term care for, uh, similar to a hospital."
9734,A,Uh-huh.
9735,B,"Uh, I know, like here in Saskatchewan, we have our hospital care the care actually for the older people graded in level, in four levels."
9736,B,"And a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care. Generally are not able to look after themselves to very, to a very great extent, physically"
9737,B,"Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's Disease or those or, or physical and mental handicaps. Uh, you know, where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind Even though  it may be minimal"
9738,A,Uh-huh.
9739,B,"And, uh, but I think that it can be helpful in that, uh, it gets people the level of physical care they need. Uh,"
9740,A,"But I don't, I mean"
9741,A,"at least, I mean I think some nursing homes do that."
9742,A,"But I think a lot of nursing homes really, uh, are guilty of neglect."
9743,B,Yeah.
9744,B,"I and I think it happens more in areas where it's, uh, I guess, uh, a broad social medical system where, uh, you know, there's government medical care and that kind of thing."
9745,B,If it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals
9746,B,"and, and I guess that's sort of my lack of understanding."
9747,B,"I think that a majority of the places in the U S, uh, you know, there is some government aid available,"
9748,B,but the majority is to the availability of the individual to pay
9749,A,Uh-huh.
9750,B,"And, uh, if you're not able to look after yourself, then you have to rely,"
9751,A,"Recently graduated from high school. Meaning like, uh, you know, three or four years ago."
9752,A,"I'm a senior in, in, uh, college now."
9753,B,Uh-huh.
9754,A,"And, uh, I can't really talk too much about the problems with, uh, public education in detail because the school system I went to was, uh, really superb even though it was a public school  system."
9755,B,Really?
9756,B,Yeah.
9757,B,"I feel that my, uh,"
9758,B,I'm a junior in college now.
9759,B,"And  I go to Tech, Georgia Tech?"
9760,A,Oh.
9761,A,Okay.
9762,A,Yeah.
9763,B,"And I,"
9764,A,"I got a friend who goes there, by the way"
9765,A,"I want to talk to you about that afterward,"
9766,A,okay.
9767,B,Okay
9768,B,"Uh, I've,"
9769,B,"the high school I went to was, uh, was a good one also."
9770,B,"And I, well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools."
9771,B,"Because the one I went to was, you know, I'm sure a, a lot nicer than, you know, a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta."
9772,A,Yeah.
9773,A,Yeah.
9774,A,"was a, a, it's more or less a suburban school system?"
9775,B,Yeah.
9776,A,Yes.
9777,A,"That, that was true for mine too."
9778,A,"Uh, although I I'm sure to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity,"
9779,A,"but I don't think, I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it."
9780,A,"You know, I  think that, uh, I mean I know that in my town, you know, most of the, most of the parents, they're valued education."
9781,B,What
9782,A,"And, uh  you know, and so the students were, you know, to some extent, motivated to learn."
9783,B,"Yeah,"
9784,B,that's true.
9785,A,I mean  know
9786,B,Yeah.
9787,B,And I'm also
9788,B,"I mean, in the, in those places where, uh, like the economy is really bad, they might, you know, be more tempted to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, you know, money to put food on the table and stuff like that. More than they would you know, in areas where they"
9789,A,"Yeah,"
9790,A,that's true.
9791,A,"But but, uh, I think, I mean even more than that, even, I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know?  Which it I mean it sounds like, uh,"
9792,B,Uh-huh.
9793,B,Yeah.
9794,B,That's true.
9795,A,"now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, uh, they have of these, uh, sort of mandatory tests if you have to take before you get  a diploma."
9796,B,Right.
9797,A,"But, uh, but, uh, certainly before that, there were people that, you know, would graduate from high school and could barely read."
9798,A,"Uh, and that's just sort of inexcusable"
9799,A,"and you can't really,"
9800,A,"I, I, I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen. You know, except maybe to someone whose, you know, really badly learning, uh, disabled or something."
9801,B,Yeah.
9802,A,But these people obviously weren't.
9803,B,"That's hard for me to say since I didn't, I didn't really grow,"
9804,B,"well when I went to elementary school it, it wasn't in a great area"
9805,B,"but I still, I mean, I learned to read, started learning to read when I was in kindergarten, you know."
9806,A,Yeah.
9807,B,"So I guess I can't really I can't say what it would be like to, uh, grow up in a really oppressed region"
9808,A,Yeah.
9809,A,Yeah.
9810,B,"You know, I guess the whole, the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people."
9811,A,Yeah.
9812,A,"And I think that's almost a bigger factor, than anything else probably."
9813,A,"I mean, I don't, I think you know, people just,"
9814,B,"So, I guess the problem is the, the thing to do is to try to, uh, to get some kind of motivation to learn"
9815,B,"and,"
9816,A,Yeah.
9817,A,"And, again, I don't, I mean"
9818,A,"got know the, you know, how qualified, I mean,"
9819,A,"I think it'd be interesting to, you know, to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. Uh, you know, sort, sort of maybe from elementary through, uh, high school.  You know, just sort of to get a feel for what it's like."
9820,B,Uh-huh.
9821,B,Yeah.
9822,B,Uh-huh.
9823,A,I think that'd be an interesting experience.
9824,A,"But, uh, I haven't done that"
9825,B,"No,"
9826,B,"I, I can't say that I have either."
9827,B,"But, uh,"
9828,A,"But I do, I do think that, uh, I mean, public education in general I think can work."
9829,A,And I think it's a good thing.
9830,B,Yeah.
9831,B,"I've, I've heard some, I mean I've heard statistics and things that, that compare a public education to a private education. I mean within like, within the same, uh, income groups."
9832,A,Yeah.
9833,B,"If you compare the, like the people that could have, that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that, you know, the people that, uh, did send their kids to private  schools."
9834,A,Yes.
9835,B,"I think they compare you know, fairly well."
9836,A,Yeah.
9837,A,Yeah.
9838,A,"I mean, I don't, I honestly don't really think I could have, you know, done much better than I did in the school system I was in. mean"
9839,B,Yeah.
9840,B,"I, I, I, my schools, I mean, there,"
9841,B,I have a lot of
9842,B,"once, once it seemed I got into high school, they had a lot of, uh, accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that."
9843,A,Yeah.
9844,B,"That, I mean, that makes a big difference"
9845,B,"cause I wondered when they're taking classes with, uh, with people that are really, are interested in the, the subject and stuff like that."
9846,A,Yeah.
9847,A,"I mean, and and in the,"
9848,A,"once you junior high, uh, start junior high, starting in eighth grade all the way through high school, there were four levels."
9849,A,"Well, no,"
9850,A,"I guess it in junior high, it was still three."
9851,A,"Then in high school it changed into four levels of, uh, of instruction in the major subjects. Uh, which,"
9852,B,Uh-huh.
9853,A,"I mean, actually I think that works pretty well."
9854,A,"and that, that makes,"
9855,A,Okay
9856,B,How are you?
9857,B,You want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget
9858,A,Yeah.
9859,A,"Well I, I, I feel like, uh, I am from Mars."
9860,A,I mean I'm fifty years old
9861,A,"and, uh, I've been divorced for, um, eighteen years."
9862,A,But I've two kids and all.
9863,A,"But I, uh, I, I've never had a budget"
9864,A,"and I don't, uh, do any planning"
9865,A,"and I don't know,"
9866,A,"I don't, uh, uh, I don't have a long-term financial plan."
9867,A,I don't try to control my expenses.
9868,A,"But I'm, I'm glad you're a stranger."
9869,B,That sounds kind of like me.
9870,A,"But, really, I'm, I happy, I, I, well I'm curious how other people live."
9871,A,"Uh, so maybe we should start with you"
9872,A,What do you do?
9873,B,About the same thing.
9874,A,Really?
9875,B,Yeah.
9876,A,Oh.
9877,A,Maybe they're going to arrest us both.
9878,B,I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children
9879,B,"and, uh, we live from hand to mouth"
9880,B,"We hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not, then we due for the next month."
9881,A,Wow.
9882,B,A couple of times we've tried some things
9883,B,and they worked
9884,B,but I'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it.
9885,A,Uh-huh.
9886,B,"The best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and, uh, took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope"
9887,A,Yeah.
9888,B,and when the envelope was empty then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area.
9889,A,Uh-huh.
9890,B,And that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent.
9891,A,Uh-huh.
9892,B,"It was just that when that was empty, you knew you were out of money."
9893,B,And we did that pretty successfully for about three months
9894,B,and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope
9895,B,and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do.
9896,A,"Huh. The, uh,"
9897,A,"I had a part-time job around, oh gosh, fifteen years ago, seventy-six,"
9898,A,"and, uh, uh, this was a sort of a career shift at the time"
9899,A,and so I was willing to take a half time job to do that.
9900,A,"And I actually did,"
9901,A,"my bank account would, uh,"
9902,A,"I'd, I, I kept bouncing checks, just at the end of the month"
9903,A,"but I, I had miscalculated."
9904,A,"I, well I didn't keep a balance"
9905,A,It's one of the problems this very
9906,A,I never had to in the past.
9907,A,"I always kept plenty of money in my checking account,"
9908,A,"but when you're only earning half the salary. Even though I wasn't spending much money, I sometimes I sometimes would just,"
9909,A,things would get to tight.
9910,A,"Uh, and sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet"
9911,A,"and every time I, uh, I spent money, I mean cash mostly, I would, uh, write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning."
9912,B,Uh-huh.
9913,B,Uh-huh.
9914,A,But I would forget to write the things down
9915,A,"and it, that I, I don't know if I ever went as far as three months or not in keeping that kind of data."
9916,A,I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever.
9917,B,"I even find now like with the automatic tellers, I'll go take money out of that"
9918,A,Yeah.
9919,B,and then I forget to take that out of my checking account.
9920,A,Uh-huh.
9921,B,"And, uh,"
9922,A,Yeah.
9923,B,"So I, I, I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and I figure that, so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there."
9924,A,Uh-huh.
9925,B,And I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make.
9926,A,Uh-huh.
9927,A,"The, uh,"
9928,A,"I, I have to say that,"
9929,A,"let's see, at this point on, I don't run out of money."
9930,A,"Uh, and it, uh,"
9931,A,"and I don't, I mean"
9932,A,"someday, if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have"
9933,A,"and I, I, I think my strategy if, if I may, is to, is to not spend money."
9934,A,I mean I don't have expensive tastes.
9935,A,I don't go out.
9936,A,"I mean I buy a car,"
9937,A,"well the last car I got rid of I'd had,"
9938,A,it was nineteen years old.
9939,B,Yeah.
9940,A,people were embarrassed for me.
9941,A,"I mean it was, it was a good car"
9942,A,"and,"
9943,B,it still running.
9944,A,"Oh, it was great."
9945,A,"My, my mechanics loved it because it was an old, it was a sixty-five Buick"
9946,A,and it just wouldn't stop.
9947,A,"Uh, and it,"
9948,A,"I, I just didn't feel the need for a new car."
9949,A,It isn't like I couldn't afford one.
9950,B,Uh-huh.
9951,A,"Uh, and now, I mean I, I don't, uh,"
9952,A,I tend to eat expensive food.
9953,A,I mean I don't mind buying a good steak
9954,A,"but for me, I only do that every week or, without even, I mean, maybe once a month."
9955,B,Yeah.
9956,A,"I mean you buy a, a tenderloin steak, it costs outrageous, like twelve dollars a pound."
9957,A,"You buy a, a, less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars."
9958,A,"To me, I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that."
9959,B,Not very often
9960,A,"But, but I'm just, I'm just saying as a single person, that's, that's a drop in the bucket."
9961,A,"And so if you're extravagant on how you buy food, it doesn't add up. If you're buying, I mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants, which I don't care to go to."
9962,B,That's right.
9963,A,"So, so that's, I think, one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that I don't have, I don't, I don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it, because I'm not interested in that expensive thing."
9964,B,lot
9965,A,You want to go first?
9966,B,"No,"
9967,B,you can start
9968,A,Okay.
9969,A,"Uh, one of the things they talked about was, uh, did we, what do we think about a judge making the decision?"
9970,B,Uh-huh.
9971,A,And I really don't agree with that
9972,A,"I think that the trial by jury is better, uh, you know, than having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible."
9973,A,"I don't think that they could be objective in every case, every time."
9974,B,Right.
9975,A,you know what I mean?
9976,B,Right.
9977,B,"There's, there, this topic is kind of mute. Uh"
9978,A,Yeah.
9979,B,"there, there's no way."
9980,B,"We, we couldn't survive in a in a juror in a trial system without a jury."
9981,A,Right.
9982,B,"Uh, one man can never be, one man, one woman can never be objectionable in every case."
9983,A,That's it.
9984,B,"Uh, every person has their opinions"
9985,B,and that's why jury selection is often very difficult. Uh.
9986,A,"Well, I, I feel the other thing too, uh,"
9987,A,"they were saying, uh, you know, what new ways could could it, you, you know, change the system."
9988,A,"I, I really think that, uh, we spend a lot of time, uh, going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal,"
9989,A,"I mean, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught, you know, point blank in the crime. There's, uh, no question"
9990,B,Right.
9991,A,it's beyond a reasonable doubt.
9992,A,"You know, all these things."
9993,A,"I mean, you know, we've gone through this over and over again."
9994,B,Right.
9995,B,They shouldn't allow an appeal.
9996,A,"And it can go on for ten, twenty, years."
9997,B,Yep.
9998,A,"I, I think this is a little ridiculous."
9999,B,Uh-huh
10000,A,I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.
10001,B,"Oh, that's right."
10002,B,I work for a law firm
10003,A,"I, I'm serious."
10004,A,And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining.
10005,B,Right.
10006,A,"You know, if someone is"
10007,B,Well plea plea bargaining is a different story.
10008,A,Well.
10009,B,Plea bargaining is something completely different.
10010,B,"That, that actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up."
10011,A,"Well, I know."
10012,A,That's what I'm saying.
10013,A,"But I think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard."
10014,A,"I mean, you know, people who commit, uh, crimes that they,"
10015,A,I don't know how it works exactly
10016,A,"but  you know, they get lesser sentences"
10017,B,Right.
10018,A,"and I understand that the jails are full of people, you know, uh  and that they have to do something."
10019,B,Right.
10020,A,"But, I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it."
10021,B,Huh.
10022,A,you know what I'm saying?
10023,A,"That we don't have, uh, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment."
10024,B,Right.
10025,A,"And, uh I, I think they should."
10026,B,We do
10027,A,"I, and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people"
10028,A,"and, uh, you know, all"
10029,B,Right.
10030,A,"they, they're caught dead to rights."
10031,A,"I, I just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life"
10032,A,"and if, they should pay for it with their life."
10033,B,Right.
10034,B,"When you're saying as far as the appeal, uh, procedure was concerned."
10035,A,Yeah.
10036,B,"We just have the case,"
10037,B,"I'm, I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry."
10038,A,Uh-huh.
10039,B,"Uh, his last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up"
10040,A,"Oh, really."
10041,B,"So, I mean, his appeal was denied"
10042,B,and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession.
10043,A,"It, uh,"
10044,A,Yeah.
10045,B,"But, uh, that was absurd"
10046,B,"There is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence."
10047,A,"I know that, that"
10048,A,Uh-huh.
10049,A,"And, I don't know."
10050,A,"Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better?"
10051,B,"Well, uh, the, the only I can, I you know,"
10052,B,"the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of."
10053,B,"Uh, like I said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd."
10054,B,There's no way that could work.
10055,A,"Oh, yeah."
10056,A,"I, I, I don't agree with that at all."
10057,B,"Uh, but,"
10058,A,Imagine the guilt that person would have.
10059,A,I mean  burned out.
10060,B,"Oh, exactly."
10061,A,"There's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself."
10062,B,Exactly.
10063,B,Right.
10064,A,"If you had to do something like that, day after day."
10065,B,No one would want the job
10066,A,No.
10067,A,Not really.
10068,B,"Uh, and, you know, like I said, the, you know, everyone has their opinions about every case."
10069,A,"Well, do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like,"
10070,B,Oh yeah.
10071,B,"I, I feel that everyone is, everyone is, uh, entitled to a trial by jury."
10072,B,"That, that, that right"
10073,A,"I mean, supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you."
10074,B,"Well, I mean, were there witnesses?"
10075,A,"In other words you're saying that, you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were."
10076,B,Right.
10077,B,Right.
10078,B,"That you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case."
10079,A,Yeah.
10080,B,I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
10081,A,Yeah.
10082,B,"and you, you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances"
10083,A,"Well, I, I,"
10084,B,"Okay, Mary."
10085,A,Yes.
10086,B,"Um, the, uh, the latest one I've seen, uh, had to do with a, uh, uh, the, uh, basically a manhunt, um,"
10087,B,"and it was, uh, it was called MANHUNTER, actually."
10088,B,"Uh, the, uh, the guy, uh, apparently had a, a, mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people. Uh, just, uh, kill them with, with as much blood and, and guts as possible."
10089,A,"Oh, how awful"
10090,B,"It was true, it was truly awful."
10091,B,"It was not one that I picked,"
10092,B,"but, uh, uh, it, it did show some, some, uh, some interesting things about the F B I"
10093,B,"because they were the, the, uh, the characters trying, trying to get him were F B I people"
10094,B,"and, uh, uh, of the, of the few good things that were in it, it did show, uh, a lot about the F B I. About the training, and, and how they go through training and how they try to, to develop, uh, uh, a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that."
10095,B,"And it was, uh, uh, it was pretty telling about the, the, the F B I and their procedures."
10096,A,I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction.
10097,B,"Yeah,"
10098,B,"I, I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, uh, going, I guess."
10099,A,"Yeah,"
10100,A,"well, they keep it rather secretive,"
10101,A,yes
10102,B,"Yeah,"
10103,B,yeah.
10104,A,"Well the most recent movie I saw, uh, I'm afraid was, uh,"
10105,A,"well two, two of them actually."
10106,A,"Uh, the RAIN MAN was one."
10107,B,Oh that was great one.
10108,A,"Wasn't that fabulous,"
10109,A,"and, and DRIVING MISS DAISY."
10110,B,"Oh, I loved it."
10111,B,"You know, I haven't seen that one yet,"
10112,B,and I need to go see it.
10113,A,"Oh, you need to see that."
10114,B,Yeah.
10115,A,That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people. Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black
10116,B,Uh-huh.
10117,A,and this all took place in the South.
10118,B,Oh my.
10119,A,"And, uh, normally never the twain shall meet."
10120,B,"You bet, especially in the South."
10121,A,"Yes,"
10122,A,"right,"
10123,A,"and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie."
10124,A,The acting was phenomenal.
10125,B,"Well as, it, as I recall it got some Academy Awards, didn't it."
10126,A,"Oh yes,"
10127,A,Jessica Tandy won best actress
10128,A,"and, uh,"
10129,B,"Oh yeah,"
10130,B,that's right.
10131,B,"It, it might have one best picture, too."
10132,A,Yes
10133,A,"it did,"
10134,A,yes
10135,A,it did.
10136,B,Yeah.
10137,A,"Just as RAIN MAN, uh, with Dustin Hoffman, uh, that, that was tremendous and Tom Cruise."
10138,B,"That was,"
10139,B,"yeah,"
10140,B,"I, I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of, uh, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman,"
10141,B,"but, uh."
10142,A,"Yes,"
10143,A,"uh, oh, that was, that was, uh, what the, much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman."
10144,B,"Yeah,"
10145,B,"it must have been great just being with him on, on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his, for his lines and all that stuff."
10146,A,Yeah
10147,A,"and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati. Which is just forty-five miles from, from where I am, where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton."
10148,B,Oh.
10149,B,"Is, is the Kmart there?"
10150,A,"Oh, we do have Kmart here,"
10151,A,you better believe it.
10152,A,Isn't there a Kmart everywhere?
10153,B,"That was, that was so funny,"
10154,B,"he had to,"
10155,B,or was it Kmart.
10156,A,Yes.
10157,B,He had to buy his underwear at Kmart.
10158,A,"Right,"
10159,A,right
10160,A,yeah.
10161,B,That was hilarious.
10162,B,"The, the, I guess the, the first, the first, uh, scene in that movie that really got my attention, uh, concerning the, the disease and all that was when he, uh, dropped the, the, uh, the toothpicks,"
10163,A,Oh yes.
10164,B,and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image.
10165,A,"Yes,"
10166,A,yes.
10167,B,Unbelievable.
10168,A,"Well, you know there are people, uh, referred to as savants also, uh, who can do most phenomenal things"
10169,B,Yeah.
10170,A,and everyone feels they are totally retarded.
10171,B,"Yeah,"
10172,B,"because that's the way they, they might seem outwardly,"
10173,A,That's right.
10174,B,"but, boy there's a lots going on in there"
10175,A,It's amazing
10176,B,"Yeah,"
10177,B,yeah
10178,B,"and I, the, the, I think the, the best thing about RAINMAN was the, uh, the way that they put together the, the real awfulness of the, of the, of the disease, only,"
10179,A,Yes.
10180,B,"an, and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it, you know,"
10181,B,"and, and, and you need to, to work with it, uh, you know, certainly on, on a daily basis but then then again work with it toward a good end. Not, not toward winning in Las Vegas, for example."
10182,A,Yes
10183,A,"and the,"
10184,A,"Right,"
10185,A,well the warmth that developed between them
10186,A,"and again it, I think was a picture of relationships."
10187,B,Yeah.
10188,A,"Again the relationship, uh, between the two, uh, that, uh, never would have occurred, uh, by accident."
10189,B,"Right,"
10190,B,right.
10191,B,"I was, uh, I was so impressed with that movie"
10192,B,I saw it three times.
10193,A,Did you.
10194,B,"I can, I can tell you, oh, so much about that movie, just because it, it really rang, uh, rang a lot of my, uh, my personal background."
10195,B,"I, I have a, a brother myself that's, that's older"
10196,B,"and, uh, he's not, you know,"
10197,B,"nothing, nothing, of course, serious is wrong with him"
10198,B,"but, uh, but we have gone through these, these lapses of, of a relationship, somewhat, sometimes,"
10199,A,Yes.
10200,B,"and then, you know, uh, for, for, for no real, you know, direct reason, I guess, uh, we, we get into, uh, uh, a really good relationship for a while and then, you know, back and forth"
10201,B,"so I, I was really able to, to relate to the, the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers."
10202,B,That was neat.
10203,A,Uh-huh.
10204,A,"Well that's tremendous,"
10205,A,"that, it's good because it does make you think, about your own family."
10206,B,"Yeah,"
10207,B,a lot.
10208,A,And see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother.
10209,B,Uh-huh.
10210,B,"No question,"
10211,B,"he, the, he was, he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that."
10212,B,He likes the bang them up and shoot them up things.
10213,A,Uh-huh
10214,B,"And, and, uh, it, it was like pulling teeth to go get him to, to see it"
10215,B,"but, uh, oh boy. He was, uh, uh, he, he gave the, the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN."
10216,B,"I mean he certainly didn't,"
10217,B,"he only saw it one time,"
10218,B,"and he didn't go back for more,"
10219,B,"but, uh, he, he said he enjoyed it"
10220,B,"and, and,"
10221,A,Well he at least saw it one time
10222,B,"Yeah,"
10223,B,"yeah,"
10224,B,"and, and he really,"
10225,B,"I don't know,"
10226,B,"he, he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway."
10227,B,But he but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this
10228,B,"I'm like, oh, come on."
10229,A,Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is.
10230,B,Yeah.
10231,A,"He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, uh, uh, with the kinds of problems that he had."
10232,B,And to make it believable.
10233,A,Yes.
10234,B,"I mean I was, I was believing it,"
10235,B,I don't know about any body else
10236,B,"but I was, it was great."
10237,A,"Well, I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them."
10238,B,He did great.
10239,A,"Well it's just, uh, been delightful talking with you."
10240,B,"Yeah,"
10241,B,"yeah,"
10242,B,you take care up there
10243,B,"and, uh, let's hear it for the summertime."
10244,A,"Absolutely,"
10245,A,"I'm ready for it,"
10246,A,but they're predicting some more snow for our direction.
10247,B,"No,"
10248,B,oh no.
10249,B,"Oh well, take care."
10250,A,Take care now.
10251,A,"Bye, bye."
10252,B,"Bye, bye."
10253,A,Where do you get most of your news?
10254,B,"I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour,"
10255,B,and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends.
10256,A,"Where, where are you?"
10257,B,I'm in Dallas.
10258,A,"Oh, yeah."
10259,B,Are you in Dallas also?
10260,A,"No,"
10261,A,I'm in San Antonio.
10262,B,"Oh, really,"
10263,B,okay.
10264,A,I get my news from a combination of sources.
10265,A,I take the paper every day
10266,B,Uh-huh.
10267,A,"and I read it on the way in to work on the, in a carpool."
10268,B,"Oh, really."
10269,A,Uh-huh.
10270,A,"And, uh, and I watch the, uh, actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work."
10271,A,"And then, you know, usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news."
10272,B,Uh-huh.
10273,B,"I normally find that uh, I'm probably the most, um, news hungry of my friends,"
10274,B,"so I don't, we don't normally talk about the news at lunch."
10275,B,"I, I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend, simply because I used to get it during the week"
10276,A,Uh-huh.
10277,B,"but, um, I would always end up arriving at work late, because I would always end up skimming the headlines, spending too much time, reading it in the morning."
10278,A,Yeah.
10279,B,"So I have to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work."
10280,B,"Um, the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television"
10281,A,Uh-huh.
10282,B,and I enjoy that quite a bit.
10283,A,Yeah.
10284,A,"Um, one of the women that I work with, her husband is Iranian."
10285,B,Uh-huh.
10286,A,So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch.
10287,B,"I will admit I work with, uh, someone who's Iranian,"
10288,B,and he definitely has a very different slant on the news.
10289,A,Uh-huh.
10290,B,"He's very, very skeptical of the news media,"
10291,B,and I will admit I'm reasonably skeptical also.
10292,B,"But he's, I don't know, uh, he's much, much more so."
10293,B,"It's sort of interesting though, because he does bring a, a much, um, different perspective with all the Gulf goings on, um."
10294,B,"He was always speaking in terms of, you know, American imperialism reasserting itself."
10295,B,"Um, I suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country."
10296,A,Uh-huh
10297,A,"Well I, I, uh, I like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize."
10298,B,Uh-huh.
10299,B,"True, um,"
10300,B,"the,"
10301,A,I understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably doesn't.
10302,B,"They, um, tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story."
10303,A,Uh-huh.
10304,B,They will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time.
10305,B,"Sort of like the, uh, what is that, A B C's NIGHTLINE."
10306,A,Uh-huh.
10307,B,"Well, I guess they only normally stick with just the one, um, story."
10308,B,"But they, they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories."
10309,A,"They don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in, in every little town."
10310,B,"No,"
10311,B,no.
10312,B,It's very much national interest news.
10313,A,Yeah.
10314,B,"A lot of times they end up, um, with these panels of experts"
10315,B,"and they go back and forth, where everyone's giving some opinions"
10316,B,"and sometimes that,"
10317,B,"I don't know the value of that, because I saw plenty of jokes and, and, um, oh, editorial cartoons about all the retired generals, making a living during the, the Gulf War."
10318,A,I've been getting a kick out of those lately.
10319,B,Uh-huh.
10320,A,"Although, um"
10321,A,"I'm only twenty-five,"
10322,A,so I've never actually been through a period of war
10323,B,Uh-huh.
10324,A,and I don't know anyone in the military
10325,A,"and I don't have a lot of background knowledge in, uh, military strategy and, and weaponry, and, and all that kind of stuff."
10326,A,And I thought the generals were very interesting.
10327,A,"Now when they started to speculate, I, I saw that for what is was, and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on."
10328,B,Uh-huh.
10329,A,"But I thought they were interesting,"
10330,A,"and, and they shed some light on what was going on for me."
10331,B,I will admit it's interesting.
10332,B,I'm twenty-six.
10333,B,So I don't have any more experience in that than you.
10334,B,"Um, it, it, it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind, you know,"
10335,B,"there were some that were screaming for air power,"
10336,B,there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it.
10337,A,Uh-huh.
10338,B,"And they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world, which I suppose just about everyone does,"
10339,B,"but these guys had a, a, uh, national soap box to stand on and, and express this view."
10340,A,"You know, one of the best television news shows that I saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on A B C,"
10341,A,and it was for children
10342,B,Uh-huh.
10343,A,"and it was hosted by Peter Jennings,"
10344,A,"and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio,"
10345,A,and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions.
10346,A,"And they, they had all their correspondents in the different areas, in Saudi Arabia, and Israel, and, and all."
10347,A,"They had them all, uh, on,"
10348,A,I don't know what you'd call it other than on line.
10349,A,They had them all on hold
10350,B,Uh-huh.
10351,A,"and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer, they would cut to that person,"
10352,A,and that person would answer the question.
10353,A,"It was just very informative and interesting,"
10354,A,"and, uh, I was real impressed at how A B C handled, uh, translating, the war for children."
10355,B,Uh-huh.
10356,B,"Yeah,"
10357,B,"I didn't see anything like that, although I did, uh,"
10358,B,"I guess one thing that I found sort of interesting,"
10359,B,"this is getting a little off the topic,"
10360,B,"but there was a, a, a big push with the local T V stations to have little hot lines with counselors to, to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children."
10361,A,Uh-huh.
10362,B,I thought that was a really unusual thing.
10363,A,"And our local H E B stores here,"
10364,A,"I don't know if it's H E B statewide or whatever,"
10365,A,"but they have videos that, uh,"
10366,A,"I don't know if they still have them,"
10367,A,"but they were free rental, videos, that had something to do with the war."
10368,B,Uh-huh.
10369,A,"Uh, it was,"
10370,B,with the children's aspect?
10371,A,Right.
10372,A,"It was something for children, that they, they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and, uh, getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing."
10373,B,Uh-huh.
10374,B,I suppose that is a valuable service.
10375,B,"Again not having, uh, lived through another war, I don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of,"
10376,B,or if that was a new concern with people.
10377,A,"Well back during the Viet Nam conflict that no one will, will have the guts enough to call a real war"
10378,B,Uh-huh.
10379,A,"uh, the, that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal."
10380,B,That's true.
10381,B,That's true.
10382,A,So I don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news.
10383,B,"And spot in the probably more importantly, one that lasted short enough that, that people's interest didn't flag too badly."
10384,A,Yeah.
10385,A,"I tell you what,"
10386,A,"the first three days, I was glued to the television."
10387,B,I will admit the same thing.
10388,B,"And I, would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer"
10389,A,"And I,"
10390,B,"and they would run these extended two, three hour versions of the program"
10391,A,Yeah.
10392,B,"and I, I was just, I was horrified and fascinated by what I was seeing."
10393,A,I tell you what.
10394,A,"The uh, the war spot in"
10395,A,"let's see, was it a Wednesday or Thursday?"
10396,A,"Must have been Thursday, uh,"
10397,A,"and Friday night I was, I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning, sitting, right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open."
10398,B,Uh-huh.
10399,A,"Because I was watching C N N,"
10400,A,"and they would, they would switch back to one of their Israel bureaus,"
10401,A,"and the people would be standing there in gas masks,"
10402,A,"and you'd be hearing the sirens,"
10403,A,"and it was just,"
10404,A,I was amazed.
10405,B,Uh-huh.
10406,B,"I, I didn't have that experience."
10407,B,"I, I don't have cable"
10408,A,Oh.
10409,B,"so I, I'm pretty much limited to P B S, which I thought, I thought they did a very good job."
10410,A,Uh-huh.
10411,B,"Um, I've got one question for you."
10412,B,I you say you take the newspaper.
10413,A,Uh-huh.
10414,B,"Um, I, I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting."
10415,B,"We've got the one fairly, well, relatively weaker paper, the TIMES HERALD, and then the MORNING NEWS, which has a very strong subscription."
10416,A,Uh-huh.
10417,B,Does San Antonio
10418,B,"you said San Antonio, right?"
10419,A,Uh-huh.
10420,B,"Do you have just one paper,"
10421,B,or do you have several?
10422,A,No.
10423,A,"There are two,"
10424,A,and they're pretty close.
10425,A,"Uh, the one that I picked is more similar in format to the newspaper,"
10426,A,I grew up near Houston
10427,B,Uh-huh.
10428,A,"and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck,"
10429,A,"and the one I picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as I was growing up. I mean, the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff."
10430,B,Uh-huh.
10431,A,"It's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over,"
10432,A,"and I enjoy,"
10433,A,the comics are better in this newspaper.
10434,A,This newspaper has the far side and the comics that I enjoy
10435,A,and the other one has some weird ones that I've never heard of.
10436,A,"So,"
10437,B,"I, I actually take both newspapers on the weekends."
10438,A,Do you?
10439,B,"I figure I'm only taking on the weekend,"
10440,B,and I can afford that.
10441,A,Yeah.
10442,B,"I, I find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better,"
10443,B,"but I sort of have a liberal political slant,"
10444,B,"and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly conservative editorial, um, outlook."
10445,A,"And my, My fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers."
10446,B,I get the TIMES HERALD just to balance that out a little bit.
10447,A,"He takes both San Antonio papers, an Austin paper, both Houston papers,"
10448,A,"I guess he takes seven, the San Marcos paper and the New Braunsfel paper,"
10449,A,"but he's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University,"
10450,A,so he's getting all the sports sections.
10451,B,Uh-huh.
10452,A,"And, so, you know, he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that go unread ..."
10453,A,I guess I don't really have a problem with capital punishment.
10454,A,"I'm not really sure what the exact, uh, specifications are for Texas."
10455,A,"I know that they, uh, have capital punishment for certain crimes,"
10456,A,"and that's probably the way I feel about it is, is, uh, it kind of depends on the crime that's committed."
10457,A,"My belief all my life, I guess, has been that, that if you take someone else's life, then you automatically giving up, uh, yours in place of it"
10458,A,"But I don't,"
10459,A,seems to be a lot of controversy about that
10460,B,Yeah.
10461,B,"Uh, uh, I tend to agree with you, uh, you know,"
10462,B,"probably pretty similar views on it,"
10463,B,"but that's, that's one of the things I don't, don't understand is, is so much of the controversy"
10464,B,"because, uh, you know, I, I do also, myself, believe in capital punishment, uh,"
10465,B,"uh, you know, it, it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the State when they so callously and usually so, you know, without even thinking or without any concern, uh, you know, end somebody else's life, and in a lot of cases several people's lives."
10466,A,That's true
10467,A,"I guess, well, there's, there's probably two or three different types of, of views as far as the controversy goes."
10468,A,"I can see where if a life was taken by accident or, uh, I don't know what you'd call it, not premeditated or, I guess primarily by accident, uh, there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for,"
10469,A,"but I lean towards, if it's premeditated or if it's, uh, kind of a habitual or, or a habit that, uh, a tendency that people, uh, may get into, then I guess I don't really have a problem with it"
10470,B,"Oh, yeah."
10471,B,"Yeah,"
10472,B,"that's, that's kind of the way I feel."
10473,B,"If, if you've got a guy who's, who's been to trial and has been in and out of jail, you know, basically a, a three time loser for the twelfth time, you know, and he goes out and kills somebody, he's not going to be reformed,"
10474,B,"he's not going to get any better, you know,"
10475,B,"it's, it's not going to, it's just not going to get any better."
10476,B,"And, and the only thing, you know,"
10477,B,"a lot of people have the opinion that, you know, don't, don't have capital punishment,"
10478,B,but give them life in jail
10479,B,"and, you know, I could go along with that, if, if I could be assured that it would be their natural life in jail and not parole after ten, or twelve years."
10480,A,Yeah.
10481,A,"Yeah,"
10482,A,"I think that's what aggravates a lot of people, is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty,"
10483,A,and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months.
10484,B,Uh-huh.
10485,B,"Yeah,"
10486,B,"it's, it's just our criminal system is just so, I guess, overloaded,"
10487,B,"but the, you know, the, the problem is not so much with the prison system, you know,"
10488,B,"I mean, because the, the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws,"
10489,B,"and the prison system are just, you know,"
10490,B,"they're trying to cope with them,"
10491,B,"but you know, the thing about capital punishment I, you know,"
10492,B,"a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent, uh, to, to future crime,"
10493,B,"and the way it is now, it's not."
10494,A,No.
10495,B,"Because, you know, you,"
10496,B,if like
10497,B,"the State of Texas, for example, may, uh, you know, may execute somebody twice a year."
10498,B,"You know, that's, that's no kind of deterrent because we, we've got literally hundreds of people on death row, and, and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row,"
10499,A,Right.
10500,B,"and that's, that's certainly no kind of deterrent,"
10501,B,"and I would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it, it's not a terrent, a deterrent, because it's not."
10502,A,"No,"
10503,A,it's not.
10504,A,"You think of your chances of getting the death penalty after uh, committing a crime are really pretty slim right now."
10505,A,"And you can, probably spend, uh, a lot of time, uh, or maybe eventually, uh, just waiting it out,"
10506,B,"Oh, yeah."
10507,B,Uh-huh.
10508,A,"and that's where a lot of aggravation comes, I think, is, is, uh, these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process,"
10509,B,Uh-huh.
10510,A,"they may spend years,"
10511,A,"and, you know, the last I heard it was costing ten, twenty, thirty thousand dollars a year, uh, to keep these guys waiting."
10512,B,"Yeah,"
10513,B,"it, it's amazing."
10514,B,"There's, uh, there's a girl I work with, our secretary, as a matter of fact,"
10515,B,"her, her father was murdered, her father and three other guys up here in Sherman."
10516,B,"And the, uh, the guy, that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death, you know, he's been on death row for like eight years."
10517,A,Yeah.
10518,B,"And, you know, this, this was her father, uh, you know, that, that got killed, you know, just cold-blooded murder, him and three other people,"
10519,B,"and, but still, for some reason, you know, this, this guy's sentence has not been carried out, you know,"
10520,B,"he's sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people,"
10521,B,"and the State still can't bring itself to, to execute, this guy."
10522,A,"To, yeah, to carry it out."
10523,A,It sort of takes the justice out of the justice system.
10524,B,"It does,"
10525,B,"it really does, you know."
10526,B,"She, and they have to go back, uh,"
10527,B,"occasionally, you know, she has to write letters to the parole board and, you know, lawyers,"
10528,B,"and just, just ever so often she mentions, well, she's got to do something else, you know, write another letter, or do something."
10529,A,Yeah.
10530,B,"It's just,"
10531,A,It should be over and done with.
10532,B,"Yeah,"
10533,B,"yeah,"
10534,B,"you know, she should be getting on with her life, you know, getting, getting that part behind her,"
10535,B,"but yet, it's, it's kind of tied to her the way it is now."
10536,A,"Yeah,"
10537,A,it is.
10538,A,"And she winds up being a, a victim, day after day after day."
10539,B,Yeah.
10540,B,"Yeah,"
10541,B,right.
10542,B,"A victim,"
10543,B,"not only of, indirectly of the crime, but also indirectly by that, indirect involvement."
10544,A,Right.
10545,B,"It's just, it's, it's ridiculous."
10546,A,"She, She's an emotional victim"
10547,B,Yeah.
10548,B,"Yeah,"
10549,B,"it, it's terrible, you know"
10550,B,"and,"
10551,A,"And, you know, the, like you say, the cops are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work, basically go out the window."
10552,B,Yeah.
10553,B,"Oh, that,"
10554,B,"oh, man, I, I couldn't be a cop for that, for that very reason, you know, because they do."
10555,B,"The, the criminal gets right back out"
10556,B,"and, you know, the cop's just got to go back and, and do his thing all over again, because so many of the crimes are, are done by repeat offenders."
10557,A,"Yes,"
10558,A,they are.
10559,B,"It's,"
10560,A,"Well, that's about five minutes,"
10561,A,"so unless you've got something else, well,"
10562,B,Yeah.
10563,B,No
10564,A,It's a pleasure talking with you.
10565,B,"All right,"
10566,B,"Ron, we'll see you later."
10567,A,"Okeydoke,"
10568,A,good-bye.
10569,B,Bye-bye.
10570,A,Okay.
10571,A,Tell me about your home.
10572,B,"Well, it's an older home."
10573,B,It was made back in the early sixties.
10574,B,It's a pier beam house.
10575,A,Huh-uh.
10576,B,"Got three bedrooms, one bath and that just makes me scream."
10577,A,That's pretty tough
10578,A,What area do you live in?
10579,B,I live in Houston.
10580,A,"Oh, okay."
10581,A,I see.
10582,A,Is that pretty typical for your area?
10583,B,"Well, for the neighborhood I'm in,"
10584,B,"yeah,"
10585,A,Yeah.
10586,B,"This is one of the more established neighborhoods,"
10587,A,Huh-uh.
10588,A,That sounds real interesting.
10589,A,I live in a suburb of Dallas
10590,A,"and, uh, I live in the basic three bedroom, two bath home."
10591,A,"So, at least, I have two bathrooms."
10592,A,"That's not so bad,"
10593,A,"but, uh, it's pretty typical for the area, as well."
10594,A,"Uh, I've always been interested in older homes, personally."
10595,A,"So, I think you can end up doing more with them, it seems like."
10596,A,What about yard space?
10597,A,"Do you have lot of, a big lot, or anything like that?"
10598,B,The whole lot I'm sitting on is roughly half an acre.
10599,A,"Oh, I see."
10600,B,"About half of that, about a quarter acre of that, I've got a garden."
10601,A,Huh-uh.
10602,A,"Oh, that's nice."
10603,A,"Because I have just like a very small, you know, those basic tract houses, like that."
10604,A,We have a very small yard
10605,A,"and, um, I do have garden,"
10606,A,"but it's extremely small,"
10607,A,"but, uh, it seems like, though, for your area that, that is sort of different."
10608,A,"In a big city like that most houses, I would think, would be sort of like what we live in. Just a you know, basic tract house."
10609,B,"Well, in the, uh, newer neighborhoods and development communities, the houses are so close together,"
10610,A,Yeah.
10611,B,if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow.
10612,A,That's exactly right.
10613,A,That's the way we are.
10614,A,"We have, uh, one thing we have that we really enjoy here, is we have a hot tub in the back."
10615,A,"So we have, we have quite a few parties,"
10616,A,"and uh, seems like everyone that lives around us, ends up, you know, hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone."
10617,A,"So, uh, that's true"
10618,A,"that is one thing that I don't enjoy about it, is the houses are too close together."
10619,A,"But, uh, you know, it's fine for now,"
10620,A,"hopefully, eventually, we'll move in a larger home."
10621,A,The only thing that I don't like also is the rooms are so small.
10622,A,"You know, it's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that,"
10623,A,so.
10624,A,Are your rooms in your house bigger since it's a sixties home?
10625,A,"Because it seems like then, that they built the homes much larger"
10626,A,is that true?
10627,B,Yeah.
10628,B,And they've got better closet space.
10629,A,Yeah.
10630,B,new houses that I've seen.
10631,A,Yeah.
10632,A,Yeah.
10633,A,That's really it.
10634,A,That's a plus.
10635,A,At least we do have like three walk-in closets here.
10636,A,"So that's, that's maybe not so typical,"
10637,A,"but, uh,"
10638,B,It helps a bunch.
10639,A,Yeah.
10640,A,"It really does, except when you have to fill them up"
10641,A,and then you get those Visa bills in.
10642,A,And
10643,B,Yeah.
10644,A,"So anyway, um, anything else about the area, about, um,"
10645,A,"you know, can you compare yourself to any thing around there."
10646,B,Most of the neighborhood I'm in is pretty typical.
10647,B,This whole neighborhood was built between sixty and sixty-five.
10648,A,Yeah.
10649,A,"So it's, it's,"
10650,B,"Everybody has got a pretty good size yard,"
10651,A,Yeah.
10652,B,"I mean, I got probably the biggest,"
10653,B,"if not the biggest yard, I've got pretty close to it,  in the entire neighborhood."
10654,A,Yeah.
10655,A,That's nice.
10656,A,That is nice.
10657,A,"But, you know, too, the only bad thing, too, is that then you have to keep up, you know,"
10658,A,"you have to,  the yard to deal with"
10659,B,"Well, I,  I enjoy that though."
10660,A,"and,"
10661,A,Do you.
10662,A,"You must have more time than, than I have."
10663,A,I'm sitting out here right now.
10664,A,We had this terrible rain
10665,A,and I'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten
10666,A,and it seems like
10667,A,"now that's, that's,"
10668,A,"I almost wish I was in an apartment or something. You know,"
10669,B,It's rained
10670,A,Yeah.
10671,A,"Well, um, I don't know, do we just terminate this or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time?"
10672,A,Do you know?
10673,B,"No,"
10674,B,"we can,"
10675,B,"after you go to somewhere between five and ten minutes, they'll get a little master recording  this."
10676,A,Okay.
10677,A,Okay.
10678,A,"Well, can you tell me anything else about the house"
10679,A,Are you working on it?
10680,A,"I mean, do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation?"
10681,B,Yeah.
10682,B,"This entire neighborhood, everybody keeps the places up real nice."
10683,A,Yeah.
10684,A,"That's, that's nice."
10685,A,"Yeah,"
10686,A,"the town that I came from is, uh, is a, uh, older town,"
10687,A,"it like,"
10688,A,"the typical, the typical homes there are like, you know, early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds,"
10689,B,Wow.
10690,A,and I renovated a house there
10691,A,and that was so much fun.
10692,A,"I mean, there, if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy-five to hundred years old, you know, you're just nobody, practically"
10693,A,"And that was really, that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline"
10694,A,"and, uh, was considered typical for that area."
10695,A,"So, uh, it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that's just, you know, a very square little box"
10696,A,"and, you know, there's not a whole lot you can do with it."
10697,A,"But, uh, anyway,"
10698,B,Living in the city has some advantages.
10699,A,Yeah.
10700,A,That's true.
10701,B,"If given the choice, I'm getting out."
10702,A,"Oh, really."
10703,A,"Well, I have lived in a small town for, you know,"
10704,A,"this, this town was like less than ten thousand people"
10705,A,and it was about sixty miles south of Dallas.
10706,A,"And, you know, I didn't move out of there until I was, you know, twenty-seven"
10707,A,"and that was just, you know,"
10708,A,so I love the big city
10709,A,"You know, I had lived in a rural area for, for so long"
10710,A,"so I've enjoyed it,"
10711,A,"but, uh, it can, it can get kind of tough."
10712,A,Its like a rat race sometimes.
10713,B,That's just something I'll never adapt to.
10714,B,"I don't, I don't want to be a part of the rat race."
10715,B,I want to be basically just kind of left alone.
10716,A,Yeah
10717,B,"If I want to sit around and mess with my garden, I'll mess with my garden,"
10718,A,Yeah.
10719,B,"if I want to work in the flower beds,"
10720,A,Yeah.
10721,A,It sounds like you enjoy working outside as well.
10722,A,"I, I,"
10723,B,Very much.
10724,A,yeah.
10725,A,I really do enjoy that.
10726,A,But I haven't planted anything yet
10727,A,"or, you know, I usually have gotten flowers coming out the"
10728,A,"but I, I haven't done that, yet."
10729,A,I've had finals this week.
10730,A,"So, uh,  you know, I'm just kind of trying to, trying to stick in with that,"
10731,B,Huh-uh.
10732,A,"but, uh, since that's over with now, maybe I can, I can get this yard in shape."
10733,A,Do you do a lot of gardening?
10734,B,"Uh, landscaping is more, than the gardening,"
10735,A,Yeah.
10736,B,"the I've got my beans, peas,"
10737,A,Yeah.
10738,B,"I've got some onions out,  tomatoes,"
10739,A,Yeah.
10740,B,I'm not real sure what they're going to do this year.
10741,A,I never have much luck with tomatoes.
10742,A,"I do plant a lot of beans, because it seems like, the, uh, bugs get on them so easily"
10743,A,"and I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that,"
10744,A,"so, the only thing that I use is soap."
10745,A,"I water, you know, spray the plants, because they say, supposedly, that will keep the bugs off them."
10746,A,"But, uh, I don't have luck with that tomato plant,"
10747,A,so I hate to spray them with anything.
10748,A,"Um, what do you do?"
10749,A,Do you have any tips you could give me?
10750,B,"Um, my favorite one is putting on the, um, tomato plant is to put, uh, dust,"
10751,A,Yeah.
10752,A,Yeah.
10753,B,"and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time,"
10754,A,That's true.
10755,A,That's true.
10756,A,My dad is a farmer
10757,A,"so, I've heard him talk about that forever."
10758,A,"I guess it works,"
10759,A,"but, um, you have to really wash your vegetables after that"
10760,A,so it won't make you sick.
10761,A,Let's see what else do you do to your house?
10762,B,"Well, I've done some rewiring on it."
10763,A,Yeah.
10764,B,"Eventually, if we stay here, I'm going to have to rewire the entire house."
10765,A,"Oh, really."
10766,A,"Do you plan on like adding any rooms or,"
10767,A,you have enough space
10768,A,you could probably do that.
10769,A,"Or is it,"
10770,B,I've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on.
10771,A,Yeah
10772,A,"I would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms,"
10773,A,that's tough.
10774,A,"Do you not, like, have a half bath."
10775,B,Not even a half bath.
10776,A,Yeah.
10777,A,Yeah.
10778,A,That's rough.
10779,A,The house that I used to live in had one bath and a half.
10780,A,And that was even just with two people.
10781,A,That was a pain.
10782,B,"The only thing that saves it, with the schedule I work and the schedule my wife works, we're getting ready to go to work at totally different times. So that. It's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning."
10783,A,That's good.
10784,A,Really.
10785,A,That could account for a lot of marital problems I think
10786,A,You get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom
10787,B,It doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on
10788,B,"and,  you're both fighting over the mirror."
10789,A,No.
10790,A,That's right.
10791,A,It does not make for a happy situation.
10792,A,That's true.
10793,A,"Well, do you have any children?"
10794,B,I've got one.
10795,A,One child.
10796,A,And they enjoy where they're living?
10797,B,"We'll,"
10798,B,he's nine months old.
10799,A,"Oh, so he doesn't know, right."
10800,A,"I guess, he's a big help out in your garden."
10801,A,Right.
10802,B,He likes to dig around a little bit.
10803,B,"His mother comes in and says, why did you let him play in the dirt,"
10804,B,I guess he's enjoying himself.
10805,A,That's right.
10806,A,"It's healthy,"
10807,A,why not.
10808,A,Yeah.
10809,B,"He was eating the dirt,"
10810,B,I wouldn't worry about it.
10811,A,No.
10812,A,It won't hurt them.
10813,A,"I was a big dirt eater, supposedly, when I was a child"
10814,A,and I turned out okay
10815,A,"so, don't worry about it."
10816,A,Just let him enjoy himself
10817,A,"So you think that you want to move away from the big city, uh?"
10818,B,"Well, that's what I've always,"
10819,B,I was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people.
10820,A,Yeah.
10821,A,So you're just the opposite from me.
10822,A,"You want to go back to that, uh,"
10823,B,"After we got married we moved, ended up moving to the Houston area."
10824,A,Yeah.
10825,A,Yeah.
10826,A,So are you from Texas?
10827,B,Yeah.
10828,A,You are.
10829,A,"So it's not, you know,"
10830,A,that's true
10831,A,"Houston, in itself, is a pretty tough place."
10832,A,"Okay,"
10833,A,I'm back on.
10834,B,Okay.
10835,A,"Um, you say you watch evenings mostly?"
10836,B,I watch evenings because I work all day.
10837,B,I used to watch daytimes.
10838,A,Uh-huh.
10839,B,"Um, mainly like ALL MY CHILDREN, that kind of thing."
10840,A,"Oh, so ..."
10841,B,"And then sometimes OPRAH and sometimes DONAHUE,"
10842,B,but now it's mainly evenings.
10843,A,Do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there?
10844,B,Yes.
10845,A,Which ones?
10846,B,"I tape THIRTY SOMETHING, and L A LAW."
10847,A,Oh.
10848,B,Those are the two I like the best.
10849,A,"Oh, two they're going to change."
10850,A,"Well, one they're taking,   off."
10851,B,I know.
10852,B,"It's going to be history, I know."
10853,A,I don't know what's going to
10854,A,"yeah,"
10855,A,we like L A LAW.
10856,B,Uh-huh.
10857,A,"We don't watch THIRTY SOMETHING,"
10858,A,but that's kind of young for us.
10859,A,My husband and I are grandparents.
10860,B,"Oh, well. Well ..."
10861,A,"So we don't watch, uh, that type of show,"
10862,A,but we like L A LAW.
10863,A,"We like, that."
10864,B,Uh-huh.
10865,A,"We're just,"
10866,A,"I'm sorry they're breaking the team up, because we liked all the ones that were on there."
10867,B,I know.
10868,B,I'm amazed.
10869,A,I'm not sure I like the new ones too much.
10870,B,Huh-uh.
10871,B,"I'm surprised that, I was surprised at the ending of, you know, with all the funny things happening and different things."
10872,A,"I just wonder if, if, uh, they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show, since it's gone on for so long,"
10873,A,"it looks like, it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show."
10874,B,Uh-huh.
10875,B,Uh-huh.
10876,B,I know.
10877,A,"Of course, I guess that's not bad."
10878,A,Alan Alda did it on MASH.
10879,B,I know.
10880,B,Isn't that funny?
10881,A,It hasn't hurt him at all.
10882,A,"So do you, do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour?"
10883,B,"Oh, I don't usually like stuff that continues."
10884,B,"That's why I'm surprised I like those two shows, because usually I like, you know, stuff that just ends sort of, that you just, you don't have to, have watched, you know."
10885,A,"In one hour, like QUANTUM LEAP."
10886,B,Yeah.
10887,B,"I mean, you don't have to ..."
10888,A,That's one of our favorites
10889,B,Yeah.
10890,B,"You don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow,"
10891,B,"so, you know, I usually don't like that."
10892,A,"Right,"
10893,A,"which they do at the beginning of the season, to grab your attention. You know,"
10894,B,Uh-huh.
10895,A,that's always a bummer too.
10896,B,I know.
10897,A,Sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one.
10898,B,Uh-huh.
10899,A,"We, we do that sometimes."
10900,A,"I, I guess I'm, I'm not into real heavy stuff."
10901,A,L A LAW is about the heaviest thing I watch.
10902,A,"I, I'll, mostly I'm into it for relaxation,"
10903,B,Yeah.
10904,A,so I like things like GOLDEN GIRLS or CHEERS
10905,A,"or, uh, Monday night is real good with me, you know, MAJOR DAD and, and, uh, NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, and, uh,"
10906,A,"oh, what's that one with Burt Reynolds?"
10907,A,"That type of show is what we what, uh, we watch."
10908,B,Uh-huh.
10909,A,"We generally just stay on one channel all, for all of Monday night, just to watch those."
10910,A,"Just some of the times they're continued,"
10911,A,but mostly they're just little vignettes.
10912,A,A new one we found we really like is that DINOSAURS.
10913,A,Have you seen that?
10914,B,Huh-uh.
10915,A,"That is, it's, it's really funny."
10916,A,"They use like animated,"
10917,A,"it's not like a cartoon,"
10918,A,"but it's like dummies and things, that are used,"
10919,B,Uh-huh.
10920,A,"and, uh, it's really, um,"
10921,A,and robots probably.
10922,A,"But there's always a, a moral to each story."
10923,B,And what night is it on?
10924,A,"Well, we watched it,"
10925,A,"the times we've seen it, it's been like on or, excuse me, Friday night."
10926,A,"Uh, but it's,"
10927,A,we've only seen it a couple of times.
10928,A,"But it, it's real,"
10929,A,"the first one we saw, um, they were, it, it involved a tradition of when a person reaches seventy-five,"
10930,A,"and I can't remember what day they call it,"
10931,A,"but, but, uh, the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff"
10932,B,"Oh, great."
10933,A,"Anyway Anyway, it, it goes on, you know,"
10934,A,"and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all,"
10935,A,"and then when it comes time for him to throw her over, well, the, the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her."
10936,B,Oh.
10937,A,"And she said no,"
10938,A,"you can't do, you know,"
10939,A,"he ran her out, was running to in a wheelchair to hide her,"
10940,A,"and she said, ""You can't do that."""
10941,B,Huh.
10942,A,"""This is tradition."
10943,A,"This is what old people are supposed to be, thrown over the, the cliff."""
10944,A,"And, uh, he said, ""I don't understand."""
10945,A,"It's, it's real funny that they give the teenagers the, as the one that questions, uh, the, what's going on."
10946,B,Uh-huh.
10947,A,"And, uh, in the end of, uh, the son-in-law, when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff, uh, the the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says, ""No, you can't do it,"" and then, and then, uh, ""Oh, well, we've got to do it. It's tradition,"""
10948,A,"and the son was, you know, ""Why?"""
10949,A,"And so, in, in the end he doesn't throw her over,"
10950,B,Uh-huh.
10951,B,"Oh, he doesn't."
10952,A,"and, of course, the town thinks he's just terrible, because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it."
10953,A,"And then we saw one where this, there was a teenage, when a teenage boy comes into his manhood,"
10954,A,"they call it the night of the howling, or something like that,"
10955,B,Uh-huh.
10956,A,"and they all go out and howl, you know"
10957,A,"And, and the son refused to do it."
10958,A,"He, he did,"
10959,A,he thought it was not ...
10960,B,So he didn't go howl?
10961,A,"No,"
10962,A,"he wouldn't go howl,"
10963,A,"so all the, all the people that worked with the father ostracized him"
10964,B,"Oh, how funny."
10965,A,It is.
10966,A,"It, it, it's, it's real interesting to watch the show,"
10967,A,"and, and the relationship between the family is, is really now, now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them."
10968,B,Huh.
10969,A,"So it's,"
10970,A,"our, our grandson, our oldest grandson is the one that, that got us to watching it."
10971,A,"But it really is, it moves real fast."
10972,A,"It's a real short,"
10973,A,"and there's always, like I say, a moral to it"
10974,A,"and,"
10975,B,"It's just a half hour,"
10976,B,or is it hour?
10977,A,"Well, half hour."
10978,B,Oh.
10979,A,"That, that's all there is to it."
10980,A,"And, and, uh, they ..."
10981,B,"There's not many half hour shows,"
10982,B,"it seems like that,"
10983,A,"Yeah,"
10984,A,"it, it, they, they're trying to liken the, the father in there of the teenage son to like JACKIE GLEASON SHOW. Uh, the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth,"
10985,B,Uh-huh.
10986,A,"and I guess maybe there are some parts of that,"
10987,A,but I didn't really see that in there.
10988,A,"But what I've read about it, they talk about that."
10989,A,"But anyway, we've, we've enjoyed that,"
10990,A,"and, and, uh, I guess mostly I, I like the news shows too, the news magazines, like SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY, TWENTY or PRIME TIME LIVE or something like that, you know, all, all of those shows, if I can do it,"
10991,B,"Yeah,"
10992,B,"no,"
10993,B,"I watch those if I,"
10994,A,"but my husband likes to watch, um, old movies, especially war movies, or, or, uh, sports, which I'm not,"
10995,B,"Oh, see, I like sports."
10996,A,"No,"
10997,A,I don't.
10998,A,"Well, I, I do, I like ice skating"
10999,A,"and I like, uh, gymnastics, and some track and field,"
11000,B,Uh-huh.
11001,A,"but I, I,"
11002,A,and I'll watch snippets of baseball games
11003,A,"and I, I just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing."
11004,B,Uh-huh.
11005,A,"And I don't ever, no matter what's on, I don't ever just sit and watch T V."
11006,A,"I'm usually either doing dishes,"
11007,A,"or I may be sewing,"
11008,A,"or, you know, I always have, or letter writing,"
11009,B,I know.
11010,A,"or I may be working around in the room somehow,"
11011,A,"but I don't, I don't ever just sit and,"
11012,A,"I, that's something that comes from your old age, you know."
11013,B,"No,"
11014,B,I don't sit.
11015,A,Idle hands are the devil's workshop
11016,B,I know.
11017,B,Who has time?
11018,B,"I don't have time to sit, I know."
11019,A,No.
11020,A,"It's, it's, uh,"
11021,B,That's why I don't get to watch that much.
11022,B,"I mean, I, watch nine o'clock"
11023,A,Right.
11024,B,"I do okay, because the kids are all in bed,"
11025,B,"but before that, I really, there's not much time."
11026,A,Right.
11027,B,Or like at six thirty I'll watch WHEEL OF FORTUNE or something like that.
11028,A,"Right,"
11029,A,"well, our,"
11030,A,"yeah,"
11031,A,"if our if our grandchildren are with us, that's, they have to watch that."
11032,A,We don't watch it unless they're here
11033,B,Uh-huh.
11034,B,"No,"
11035,B,I like that.
11036,B,"No,"
11037,B,"I'll watch, game show kind of stuff"
11038,A,"But they, uh,"
11039,B,"but, Yeah."
11040,A,"It's, it's, um, oh,"
11041,A,"and, you know, the, the kids will get you started on stuff like AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS."
11042,A,We've wound up sending in one.
11043,A,That's something I didn't think that we'd ever do
11044,B,Did you send one?
11045,A,Yeah.
11046,A,My oldest grandson pulling his tooth.
11047,A,"He's, he's, he wouldn't let us pull it,"
11048,B,How funny.
11049,A,"and I mean, it, it got to the point he was eating a pear here,"
11050,A,"and he bit into it,"
11051,A,and it was just hanging by a thread.
11052,A,"And I, and I'd tell him, you know, it's getting ready to fall out,"
11053,A,"and he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open, hoping it would because he wouldn't let anybody pull it."
11054,A,"And he he wound up pull,"
11055,A,So do you have P C
11056,B,I have a personal computer at home.
11057,B,It's an A T compatible.
11058,B,I don't use it very much any more.
11059,B,I used to use it quite a bit.
11060,A,Uh-huh.
11061,B,I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal.
11062,B,"I do some P C stand alone work on it,"
11063,B,and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame.
11064,A,Uh-huh.
11065,B,What about you?
11066,B,Do you own a computer?
11067,A,"Um, well I sort of own a computer."
11068,A,"We have two P C at home,"
11069,A,but neither one do we really own. Um.
11070,B,Are you leasing them?
11071,A,"No,"
11072,A,"both of them are sort of work related,"
11073,A,"and,"
11074,B,Loaners from work?
11075,A,"Yeah,"
11076,A,"that's the nicer way, right."
11077,B,Do you work for T I?
11078,A,"No,"
11079,A,no.
11080,A,"Um, I, actually I'm doing consulting right now because I just had a baby,"
11081,A,"and my husband's working at Bell Labs,"
11082,A,"but he's really from France,"
11083,A,and these computers actually are from France.
11084,B,What brand are they?
11085,A,One of them's a Compaq
11086,B,Uh-huh.
11087,A,it's a three eighty-six
11088,B,I'm jealous.
11089,A,"and the other is actually a I B M P C compatible,"
11090,A,"it's a three eighty-six,"
11091,A,"I guess it's twenty-five,"
11092,A,"yeah,"
11093,A,three eight six twenty-five C maybe
11094,A,"I don't know,"
11095,A,no we don't have the
11096,A,we decided not to get the which is actually another loaner one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing
11097,A,"and,"
11098,B,What kind of consulting do you do?
11099,A,"Um, well, I actually do some work, working at M I T and at NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington,"
11100,B,Uh-huh.
11101,A,and then I worked for Dragon Systems for a while.
11102,B,What kind of work do you do when you're consulting?
11103,A,"Um, well, it depends,"
11104,A,"it's very different in the different places,"
11105,A,"but,"
11106,B,Is it programming related?
11107,A,"Yeah,"
11108,A,yeah.
11109,A,"Program related, research related,"
11110,A,"and I work in the speech field,"
11111,A,"and I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech,"
11112,B,Uh-huh.
11113,A,"and I do that type of stuff typically for other people,"
11114,A,"and we, like here we use the P C to do that."
11115,A,Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that.
11116,B,Word processing.
11117,A,"Well, more, uh,"
11118,A,"do you know Latek? Word text processing,"
11119,B,No I'm not familiar with that.
11120,A,"so I don't, I don't use, I mean,"
11121,A,"you can call it word processing,"
11122,A,but I don't usually use a word processor to do it
11123,B,Uh-huh
11124,A,and we don't have too much standard software.
11125,A,"Like I haven't bought, we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all."
11126,A,So we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that.
11127,A,"We use it more for just writing programs when we need to or, um, doing research, looking at the speech signal and then doing writing, and also as a just as a terminal,"
11128,A,and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that.
11129,B,"So, you've got, you've got a modem in it then."
11130,A,"Uh, neither one has a modem,"
11131,A,but we have a modem.
11132,B,At home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them?
11133,A,"Neither one,"
11134,A,Right.
11135,B,"Uh, and so it's an external modem."
11136,A,"Yeah,"
11137,A,we have
11138,B,"I got, when I got mine I had an internal modem in it"
11139,A,Uh-huh.
11140,B,"I used it, uh, quite a bit when I was, uh, uh, looking at, uh, information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in a, in Fort Worth"
11141,A,Uh-huh.
11142,B,"but, uh, went out of town for a while,"
11143,B,"and, and sort of got off the, uh, bulletin board and off of my micro completely"
11144,A,Uh-huh.
11145,B,"and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without, uh, even without using it on the computer,"
11146,B,"I could turn a computer on,"
11147,B,it'd start squawking.
11148,B,So I finally opened up the box and took it out.
11149,A,So that was it.
11150,B,I think that's the thirty second warning.
11151,A,"Oh, I didn't hear it."
11152,A,"Do you hear, the, the beep in the background."
11153,B,Yes.
11154,A,"Oh, that's a, an ambulance or something going on here, I think."
11155,B,Okay.
11156,B,"Where, Where are you,"
11157,A,I haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually.
11158,B,"and, uh,"
11159,A,In Manhattan.
11160,B,Are you at home now?
11161,A,"Yeah,"
11162,A,I'm at home.
11163,B,So you've got a lot of traffic noise real close.
11164,A,Uh-huh.
11165,A,"So it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal I mean, because there's a lot of background noise that, you know, people can hear."
11166,A,So it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up.
11167,A,"Um, yeah,"
11168,A,"and often times that,"
11169,A,"I can't talk on can't do this much later than now, between sort of like six, five thirty and six thirty or something like that, because the traffic outside, they honk the horn so loud I can't even hear the phone call."
11170,B,What time is it now where you are?
11171,A,"Uh, about twenty after four."
11172,B,So you're an hour ahead of where I am.
11173,B,I'm in Central Central time zone.
11174,A,"Okay,"
11175,A,yeah
11176,A,we're Eastern.
11177,A,"And, um, what did, did you ever try using like Prodigy or any of those systems?"
11178,B,"No,"
11179,B,I haven't done that.
11180,B,"Uh, I know someone who has,"
11181,B,"and, and she's, uh, very, uh, pleased with it."
11182,B,"She told me some of the things you can do,"
11183,B,"and it's just a, a very handy tool to have."
11184,A,Uh-huh.
11185,B,"Yeah,"
11186,B,and you can do a
11187,B,it makes things very convenient.
11188,B,"You can save a lot of money, too. Certainly cut down on long distance charges if you, if that's what you have in mind."
11189,A,"Uh-huh,"
11190,A,"yeah,"
11191,A,"I've never tried using that,"
11192,A,I don't know too much about it.
11193,A,"What about,"
11194,A,"have you, did you use commercially available software"
11195,A,"or,"
11196,B,"I have, I have used Lotus."
11197,B,"I have used, uh, Word Perfect"
11198,A,Uh-huh.
11199,B,"uh, I,"
11200,B,not heavy use.
11201,B,"I've used, uh, D Base"
11202,B,"and, uh, I've used a substantial amount of shareware."
11203,B,"Um, I haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job."
11204,B,I've been through three classes
11205,A,Uh-huh.
11206,B,and I have a great deal of respect for it.
11207,A,Uh-huh.
11208,B,"Um, I haven't done much word processing work with my job."
11209,B,I do some
11210,A,Uh-huh.
11211,B,"and I,"
11212,B,and the D Base work I've done was strictly class related.
11213,A,"I've never used D Base, um,"
11214,A,but I've heard both good things and bad things about it.
11215,B,"Well, it's probably the granddaddy of most, uh, data base management systems."
11216,A,Uh-huh.
11217,B,It's got some pretty strong competitors.
11218,B,"Some of them have reviews that are better than D Base,"
11219,B,"so, I, I think by now, it's a matter of, uh, personal taste."
11220,A,"Yeah,"
11221,A,people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use.
11222,B,I can understand that very easily.
11223,B,"I've used, I've had a class on, um, R Base and also in Paradox"
11224,A,Uh-huh.
11225,B,and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base.
11226,A,Uh-huh.
11227,A,Do you think you D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more.
11228,A,Or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days?
11229,B,"Um, I wouldn't say compatible, but certainly comparable."
11230,A,"But, uh"
11231,A,"yeah,"
11232,A,"I didn't mean compatible,"
11233,A,I meant comparable.
11234,A,My brain is going to mush.
11235,B,Uh-huh.
11236,A,And what do you work on at T I?
11237,B,I'm a computer programmer on the I B M main frames.
11238,A,Uh-huh.
11239,A,Uh-huh.
11240,B,"I do, uh, mainly business data processing."
11241,A,Uh-huh.
11242,B,I also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility.
11243,A,Uh-huh.
11244,B,"Um, sometimes I get called late at night at home because there's a production problem,"
11245,B,"and that gives me the opportunity to, uh, come in to work and fix it, if I can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone."
11246,A,Right.
11247,B,"Um, I also, uh, handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected,"
11248,B,Okay.
11249,A,"Um, well I guess first of all I, I could have asked that before."
11250,A,Do you have children?
11251,B,No.
11252,A,No.
11253,A,Okay.
11254,A,"Because I, I didn't know if that would make a difference  in how you felt."
11255,B,Yeah.
11256,A,"Um, what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two,"
11257,B,I think it's a good idea.
11258,B,"I think everybody should, should, uh, put in their time so to speak for the, for the good of the, the nation and for the good of themselves."
11259,A,Yeah.
11260,B,"I think it's, uh,"
11261,B,"would everyone grow up and mature and, and realize what this country's all about."
11262,A,"I just, um,"
11263,A,"I guess that's my, that's something that my family has always believed strongly in,"
11264,A,"and, uh, I had opportunities in high school, to work in some programs, um"
11265,B,Did you?
11266,B,something Oh!
11267,A,"and, and I agree with what you said that it's, uh, it benefits the person doing it  so much I don't think they realize"
11268,B,Uh-huh.
11269,A,"and I, uh, I, I think it gives you a better perspective, on life"
11270,A,"and, uh, it gives you a little bit, uh, more a glimpse of the, the real world"
11271,A,"and  and it would certainly help the country, too, uh."
11272,B,Yeah.
11273,B,Really
11274,B,"Yeah,"
11275,B,"I think that's probably like, uh, quite a few things that, that the kids, uh, maybe not so much nowadays but used to  go through, you know,"
11276,A,Yeah.
11277,B,"they, just, they were, they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do."
11278,A,Yes.
11279,A,Yeah.
11280,A,"Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um,"
11281,A,"my first, when I first thought of it, I thought it, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful."
11282,A,"And then, I wondered if people were unwilling"
11283,A,"but, but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long."
11284,A,"Um, but I do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um, they, do still have opportunities."
11285,B,Uh-huh.
11286,B,"Yeah,"
11287,B,that's probably true  You know
11288,A,"But, I, I think that's a small, uh, number could,"
11289,B,"but even, even through those groups, do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to?"
11290,A,"No,"
11291,A,"um, not since, um, not as much as I remember growing up."
11292,A,"And that was something, uh, I think in the fifties and sixties, um, seemed more common in the last two decades."
11293,B,Uh-huh.
11294,B,Yeah.
11295,B,I think that's probably true.
11296,A,"But,"
11297,B,"I think it's probably more true, still in the, in the smaller communities then in the larger cities."
11298,A,Yeah.
11299,A,Yeah.
11300,A,"Where, uh, where abouts do you live?"
11301,A,What part of the country?
11302,B,"Well, I live in Richardson right now. Which is just,"
11303,A,"Oh, okay."
11304,A,We're in Plano
11305,A,so we're not far apart.
11306,B,Right.
11307,B,"Yeah,"
11308,B,okay.
11309,A,"One of the calls I'd gotten before was, uh, down to Austin"
11310,A,"and, and I know, a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest"
11311,A,so I know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area.
11312,B,Yeah.
11313,B,"Gosh,"
11314,B,I hadn't even thought about it being out of the area
11315,B,but you're right.
11316,B,Yeah.
11317,B,I grew up in a real small town in Florida.
11318,A,Oh.
11319,B,I mean a real small town
11320,B,"And, uh, I think it was just"
11321,B,"of course it was back in the, in the fifties"
11322,B,and I think it was real prevalent back then.
11323,B,"I I think people thought more of others than they do now. You know, as far as doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits from it."
11324,A,Yeah.
11325,A,"Well,"
11326,A,"and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back. Um, if we've lost some of that"
11327,A,"and it, it seems in the last decade or two, um, that's true,"
11328,A,"maybe that's a way,"
11329,A,"if, if young people had to do it um, maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things I always thought was a wonderful part of our country. Um,  is helping others"
11330,B,Uh-huh.
11331,B,"Yeah,"
11332,B,I do to.
11333,B,I do to.
11334,B,"I'm not sure that, that today's kids would go for it though."
11335,B,I think you would have to start younger.
11336,A,Yeah.
11337,B,"I, I don't know how young you'd have to go"
11338,B,"but I think by the time they're, oh, early teenagers anyway, I think it's too late now. At least around here."
11339,A,"Yeah,"
11340,A,"I think, uh, I think it does help, um, even preschoolers, you know"
11341,A,"they're, um, things even just starting around the home.  You know"
11342,B,Right.
11343,A,little ones can do a little bit to help the family.
11344,B,Uh-huh.
11345,A,"And, and just watching the parents do things too, um, it can start a pattern."
11346,A,"There's always something, no matter how young,"
11347,A,and then that helps develop that attitude.
11348,A,"Um, I guess I would really like to see this happen with families more."
11349,A,"You know, I think this is certainly a possible way, um, to handle it"
11350,A,"but I wish,"
11351,A,that's something that I think that has been lost in families
11352,A,and I think that's a good place to start again.
11353,B,Yeah.
11354,B,"I think it has to start in the families first because if you don't do it for, for your own immediate family, you're sure not going to do it for anybody else."
11355,A,Yeah.
11356,A,"And I do think, um, the schools,"
11357,A,"if you're trying to do something, even with food drives"
11358,A,"and, uh, sometimes what Richardson and Plano both,"
11359,A,I mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is.
11360,B,Uh-huh.
11361,A,"I mean, that's, uh,"
11362,A,"gosh I'm sure, not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas"
11363,A,"and, uh  it's,"
11364,B,That's probably true.
11365,B,That's probably true.
11366,A,"I know our church youth group, uh, starts with projects young"
11367,A,but they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia  area every year.
11368,B,Uh-huh.
11369,A,They've done this for fourteen years now.
11370,B,"Oh, that's great."
11371,A,"Um, and it is, it's, uh,"
11372,A,"and they've also see that there's, there's a different way of life and those families are really close."
11373,A,"Some of the things, that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there"
11374,B,Uh-huh.
11375,A,"and, uh, it really,"
11376,A,every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed
11377,A,and it's changed their perspective.
11378,A,"And, and that's just the two weeks during, during the summer."
11379,B,Uh-huh.
11380,A,"So, if two weeks, uh, could have that kind of effect I would  think, uh,"
11381,B,"Well, that's, that's great."
11382,B,"I'm glad that there are still some areas that, that get the youth involved in that sort of thing."
11383,A,"Well that's,"
11384,B,"Like I said, I think it does,"
11385,B,even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference  in their attitudes
11386,A,Yes.
11387,B,Well
11388,A,"Well, I guess, um,"
11389,A,did you have anything else?
11390,B,"No,"
11391,B,no
11392,B,I guess that's about all.
11393,A,Okay.
11394,B,Okay.
11395,A,"Well, I enjoyed talking with you."
11396,B,"Well, good talking with you."
11397,A,And I hope you have a good evening.
11398,B,You too.
11399,A,Thanks.
11400,B,Okay.
11401,A,"Bye,"
11402,A,bye.
11403,B,Bye
11404,B,Okay.
11405,B,"Do you, have you ever had to put your children in, child care, Mary Dell?"
11406,A,Oh yes.
11407,A,I'm an old experienced hand.
11408,A,"I started back when it wasn't, stylish to do that at all."
11409,A,My daughter that's seventeen now I worked even when she was a baby.
11410,B,Uh-huh.
11411,B,Oh.
11412,A,And I had private care for both my daughters until they were two
11413,A,"and then I was really lucky to have put them in a, Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist, right off  of Walnut Hill and Preston."
11414,B,Uh-huh.
11415,B,Uh-huh.
11416,A,And it was a wonderful environment.
11417,A,"I, I just wish all kids, if they have to be put in day school, could have that kind of place"
11418,B,Uh-huh.
11419,B,I see.
11420,A,"So, it worked well."
11421,B,Oh.
11422,A,How about you?
11423,B,"Well, I have, uh, a nine year old and a six year old"
11424,B,"and neither one of them has ever been in in, uh, day care for the reason of, of me working"
11425,A,Uh-huh.
11426,A,Uh-huh.
11427,B,"but, uh, they both went through preschool."
11428,A,Yeah.
11429,B,"And, uh, we've just been real lucky  I think, anyway. To not,"
11430,A,Uh-huh.
11431,A,It's not hard to find anything that's part-time.
11432,A,So many of the churches have really strong  preschool and children's day out
11433,B,"Right,"
11434,B,like half day programs.
11435,B,Uh-huh.
11436,B,Uh-huh.
11437,A,"but, it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little"
11438,A,and this is one of the few churches that did it.
11439,A,There were a couple downtown Dallas
11440,A,"but they were so, seemed, cold and impersonal,"
11441,A,I just couldn't hack it.
11442,B,Uh-huh.
11443,A,"And what I liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there when Cheryl was two, which was fifteen years ago, many of them are still there today."
11444,A,So there  was real continuity.
11445,B,Oh.
11446,A,She went back as a teenager
11447,A,and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there.
11448,B,"Oh, my gosh."
11449,A,"So, it, it was really neat."
11450,A,But it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love
11451,A,"and  she just kept good people and  real cheerful place, lots of arts and crafts,"
11452,B,Uh-huh.
11453,B,Oh my goodness
11454,A,and I'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that.  That if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff.
11455,B,Right.
11456,B,Right.
11457,B,Yeah.
11458,B,Uh-huh.
11459,B,"Yeah,"
11460,B,"that is, uh, a big drawback I think in that, in the, uh, public schools out here. You know, to,"
11461,A,Uh-huh.
11462,B,you're lucky to have an art teacher
11463,B,"and if you do you get them once a week or something, you know."
11464,A,Or pay for it after school.
11465,A,Our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman
11466,A,and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art
11467,A,"and   you know, I willingly did it"
11468,B,Oh is that right?
11469,B,I had no idea.
11470,A,"but I thought, this makes me angry."
11471,A,This is something that ought to be in the schools  rather than some of the other stuff they do.
11472,B,Oh my goodness.
11473,B,"And with our budget cuts, I'm sure  that's not going to not going to change anytime soon."
11474,A,Yeah.
11475,A,"Well that's the only way they're. Yeah, well, that's the only way they're going to be able to do it."
11476,A,And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that.
11477,B,Oh my goodness.
11478,A,"So, in some ways I think the, the day schools do serve those purposes."
11479,B,Yeah.
11480,B,That's true.
11481,B,"Well even the preschools, you know they get so much of that in preschool"
11482,B,"and then when they hit kindergarten, you know, it's like wham  Culture shock."
11483,A,Yeah.
11484,A,Yeah.
11485,B,"It's just,"
11486,A,Put the colors away
11487,B,"Yeah,"
11488,B,yeah.
11489,B,Get the computers out
11490,A,Which is too bad.
11491,B,"and, you know."
11492,A,Uh-huh.
11493,B,hard.
11494,A,Uh-huh.
11495,B,It's so difficult for them.
11496,B,"Um, did you have your children, did you say in home, in, in, private care,"
11497,B,was that in your home or in someone else's home?
11498,A,Until they were two.
11499,A,Yeah.
11500,A,"Yeah,"
11501,A,both times they were at our house.
11502,B,Uh-huh.
11503,B,So you were able to have somebody come there.
11504,A,And that was hard too.
11505,A,"I, I lucked out with really good people both times"
11506,A,but I know so many people that are never able to find that
11507,A,"and I'd practically give my paycheck away to do it,"
11508,A,so
11509,B,Yeah.
11510,B,Yeah.
11511,B,Did you have a nanny
11512,B,or did you have someone  that lived in with you?
11513,A,Yeah.
11514,A,"Well no,"
11515,A,she didn't live with us.
11516,A,"Uh, the first one was an, elderly lady who was putting a, a daughter through nursing school  just purely on baby-sitting money."
11517,B,Oh.
11518,B,Oh my goodness.
11519,A,And she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night.
11520,B,Uh-huh.
11521,A,And she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had  because both our parents are dead.
11522,B,Yeah.
11523,B,Oh.
11524,A,"So that, that was a plus from  that respect as well."
11525,B,Oh gosh.
11526,A,And then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her.
11527,B,Uh-huh.
11528,B,Uh-huh.
11529,A,"So,"
11530,B,"I have, uh,"
11531,A,I just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center.
11532,B,Uh-huh.
11533,B,"I was just listening to a program this morning,"
11534,B,"oh well, I guess it was on the HOME SHOW,"
11535,B,"but they were talking about, uh, a new, uh,"
11536,B,oh I can't even think of the name of it.
11537,B,I was halfway listening while I was painting
11538,A,Uh-huh.
11539,B,"Um, it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children"
11540,A,Uh-huh.
11541,B,"and they've now moved it to Washington, D C"
11542,B,"and the, the doctor that was on there, the pediatrician said, you know, I can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care   and leaving them there."
11543,A,Yeah.
11544,A,Oh that would be hard.
11545,B,"You know, so, um,"
11546,A,"Well, they give a lot more leave."
11547,A,"I work at N C N B now,"
11548,A,"and our benefits for maternal and, and parental care and even for elderly people are, are really expanding."
11549,B,Uh-huh.
11550,A,"We have more options now then we did when I, my kids were born,"
11551,A,"with being able to take off full-time longer of, you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time for   up to six months."
11552,B,Uh-huh.
11553,B,"Oh boy, that's great."
11554,A,It's really neat.
11555,A,"I've, I've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week"
11556,A,"or they've, you know, whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint."
11557,B,Uh-huh.
11558,B,Uh-huh.
11559,A,We try to work it with their hours.
11560,A,"And that helps because you don't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say  okay, I never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again."
11561,B,Yeah.
11562,B,Right.
11563,B,Right.
11564,A,And the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals.
11565,A,"I've,"
11566,A,"of course it's too late for me so  I've, I've not tried them to see how effective they are"
11567,B,Yeah
11568,A,but  I think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
11569,B,Uh-huh.
11570,B,Uh-huh.
11571,B,"God, it's amazing"
11572,A,"And for our age group it's too late, too little, too late."
11573,B,Right.
11574,B,Right.
11575,A,"But I, I do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work."
11576,B,Uh-huh.
11577,B,Uh-huh.
11578,A,Two income families I think are here to stay.
11579,B,"Well and I would think, you know, since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do you know, the, the people that work in big business have families"
11580,A,Uh-huh.
11581,A,Right.
11582,B,they have children.
11583,A,Yeah.
11584,B,"So, it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and  working"
11585,A,Oh sure.
11586,B,"and, uh,"
11587,A,You retain employees and keep them longer.
11588,A,"That's, that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that  they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces"
11589,B,Uh-huh.
11590,B,Uh-huh.
11591,B,Right.
11592,B,Right.
11593,B,Right.
11594,A,"So, I, I hope it helps."
11595,A,It seems to help the new mothers  not have to come back full-time.
11596,B,Oh that's good.
11597,A,because that's hard.
11598,B,That's good to know.
11599,B,"I have a couple of friends that, have, have found the, uh, you know, a a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age."
11600,A,Uh-huh.
11601,A,Uh-huh.
11602,B,And they
11603,B,"usually, you know, you'll find a, a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home"
11604,A,Uh-huh.
11605,B,"and my future, future sister-in-law's mother does that too, full-time."
11606,A,"Well in Plano though the problem is, you find,"
11607,A,and this is what I found with Emily.
11608,A,"I, from the time she started first grade, I wanted her out in Plano area."
11609,B,Uh-huh.
11610,A,And I kept finding neighbors and friends
11611,A,and they'd move.
11612,B,Oh.
11613,A,She ended up being in a different home every year.
11614,B,Too transit.
11615,B,Uh-huh.
11616,A,And I finally decided I didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move.
11617,B,And her surroundings.
11618,A,"So this year I, I tried Kinder-Care"
11619,A,"and, then she's old enough to"
11620,A,Okay.
11621,A,"Well, let's see,"
11622,A,"well, we keep our paper, paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and, glass and, uh, plastics"
11623,A,"and, uh, we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full."
11624,A,I guess we collect milk cartons and whatever other plastics are acceptable.
11625,B,"Are you in the part of town where, uh, they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling?"
11626,A,"No,"
11627,A,"no,"
11628,A,I didn't think that anybody had those at all yet.
11629,B,"Well, maybe they don't."
11630,B,"I, I know that was supposed to be in May"
11631,B,"and I couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was, was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were."
11632,A,Right.
11633,A,"Well, no,"
11634,A,"I haven't seen any,"
11635,A,"so I, I thought that it all, had all been delayed several times."
11636,A,So I have no idea what they look like
11637,A,"and, I'm kind of anxious to see them."
11638,B,"Yeah, That's going to be interesting because it's, uh, we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is uh,"
11639,B,"I look at our big green containers,"
11640,B,"and I say, well, they work fine"
11641,B,and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors
11642,B,"but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh,"
11643,A,"Oh, right."
11644,B,it will be interesting to see how well that works
11645,B,"and I am, I'm glad the community is doing it."
11646,B,"Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people."
11647,B,"Uh, I don't know if, where you grew up in your, what you saw back, uh, years ago,"
11648,B,"but for me the thing that strikes me is I, uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass"
11649,A,Right.
11650,A,Right.
11651,B,"and you got a nickel or dime, which in that time was a lot of money, when you returned them."
11652,B,Pop bottles all had a deposit on them.
11653,A,Oh.
11654,A,"Oh, of course."
11655,A,"That, they did."
11656,A,"You know actually, we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles"
11657,B,Oh.
11658,A,and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house.
11659,B,Uh-huh.
11660,A,You could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed
11661,B,Yeah.
11662,A,and so you just put the empty ones back out there
11663,A,"and he took them away and put, you know, put another gallon of glass, glass bottle in there."
11664,B,Yeah.
11665,A,"So, uh, yeah,"
11666,B,"So, uh, you know, I look back at, at, uh, my childhood"
11667,B,"and I'd say, you know, they were doing things then that we should be doing now"
11668,B,"and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're, we're, uh, kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this, uh, throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies."
11669,A,"Right,"
11670,A,"right,"
11671,A,"it would be nice, it would be nice to see it take a good turn here."
11672,A,It seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away
11673,A,"so I hope that this time it, it stays."
11674,A,"Just, To see stacks and stacks of newspapers just to the trash is just amazing."
11675,B,Yeah.
11676,A,"So, uh, you know, we, when we go dump, actually when we go dump our things, oh, we collect newspapers, too, and then take them,"
11677,A,"seems like there's a pretty well, there's a pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics"
11678,B,Uh-huh.
11679,A,so that's kind of encouraging.
11680,A,"I didn't know, you know, I didn't know if we started to do that."
11681,A,I didn't know what to expect.
11682,B,"Yeah,"
11683,B,"well I'll have to say I'm, I'm, the only one I'm good at at this point is the newspaper. Uh, taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans uh, getting rid of those,"
11684,A,Right.
11685,B,"but on the plastic, I have, uh, I don't have any habits there yet"
11686,B,"and I'm, guess I'm waiting for the city to, to push me in that direction"
11687,B,"but, But, it just seems like on the larger scale that, you know, the, we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things"
11688,A,"Well, I guess they will shortly."
11689,A,"I, uh,"
11690,B,"and I think if, uh, if we just start to put, you know, the nickel deposit on things, like, uh, was the case years ago that, uh, it would have more immediate effect, uh, than,"
11691,B,because I remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money
11692,A,"Oh, right."
11693,B,and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window
11694,B,"and so outside my little town, we would, uh, go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something."
11695,A,Yeah.
11696,A,Right.
11697,A,"Do you know, I saw in Tom Thumb yesterday, I saw the return to the, uh, the small Coke bottles."
11698,B,Yeah.
11699,A,And I don't know if there's a deposit on those or not.
11700,B,"I,"
11701,B,"well that's interesting because,"
11702,B,"they're back to glass, you're saying?"
11703,A,"They were glass, they were the glass, uh,"
11704,A,"well, let's see,"
11705,A,"they'd be, I don't know, maybe ten ounce or six ounce or ten ounce. Sort of a small size, sort of a small size and, and we, anyway we just, we didn't stop and look them, look at them a long time"
11706,B,Uh-huh.
11707,B,Yeah.
11708,A,"but, and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down, you know, uh sort of, sort of a basket type thing."
11709,B,Uh-huh.
11710,B,The carton. The paper carton.
11711,A,"Right,"
11712,A,"right,"
11713,A,"so, I hadn't seen that in a long time."
11714,B,Yeah.
11715,B,"Well, I mean the,"
11716,B,"you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do, we were doing"
11717,B,"and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons, the wood uh, racks which now, basically, you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold, uh, twenty-four bottles."
11718,B,"And, and, uh, uh, I'm not really say going back to good old days,"
11719,B,but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now.
11720,A,"Yeah,"
11721,A,"yeah,"
11722,A,"well,"
11723,B,"Well, it will be interesting to see how, over the next year, this all works out because, like on the, uh, grass, I'm, I know your husband, uh, doesn't really like the paper sacks."
11724,A,"No,"
11725,A,he doesn't like the paper sacks
11726,A,"and, uh, but he, but, you know, he likes to pick the grass up, too."
11727,A,"He doesn't, Doesn't,"
11728,B,Yeah.
11729,B,"I'm the, I'm the same way because otherwise, uh,"
11730,B,"oh, I'm, I generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays and Neal, uh, Neal's a person who says, I like to pick it up"
11731,B,"but I don't believe in throwing it into the, uh, the landfill,"
11732,B,"so I have my compost pile,"
11733,B,"but most of us don't have the, uh, sufficient, lot size to, uh, to do that."
11734,A,"Right,"
11735,A,right.
11736,B,"Uh, so I'm glad the city's willing to take that on."
11737,A,That's nice.
11738,A,"I guess they dump it the same place,"
11739,A,I wonder where they dump that.
11740,B,"Well, there's someplace, you know,"
11741,B,"if it's,"
11742,B,"because really, when I look at what my grass does in, in actually about twenty-four hours, uh, knowing what the farmers do in rural areas, they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally, uh, composts or stores"
11743,B,"and, uh, so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it"
11744,B,"and it will naturally decompose uh,"
11745,B,so you just have to kind of keep in separated
11746,B,"and then, uh, who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into,"
11747,B,but it's certainly usable material.
11748,A,"Yeah,"
11749,A,"yeah,"
11750,A,"well they must, they must keep it separate if they have this date in."
11751,B,Uh-huh.
11752,A,"They have this day now, that it's, you know, separate from the other trash pick up."
11753,B,Right
11754,B,"But, I, the thing I don't understand about that is, like when,"
11755,B,"it's one thing to send grass there,"
11756,B,"but I've trimmed trees and other things which, uh, end up being something that, clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly,"
11757,A,No.
11758,A,"Okay, well, um,"
11759,B,What kind of music do you like?
11760,A,"I, um, I was thinking about it for a long time,"
11761,A,and I like basically almost every form of music and type of music.
11762,A,"Um, I don't have a whole lot of dislikes."
11763,A,"I, um, like jazz, um, especially the blues,"
11764,A,"and, uh, I like, uh, a lot of the, uh, of course the classics, um, everything back from Bach and, and Beethoven and Chopin and, um, just in general everything."
11765,B,Uh-huh.
11766,A,"Um, I enjoy, uh, a lot of the, the modern forms, um, uh,"
11767,B,"Do you like, like rock and those kind of things punk even."
11768,A,"Right,"
11769,A,right.
11770,A,"Uh, well, that gets,"
11771,A,"some of the punk, um, when I was in high school, that was, uh, one of the big things, was punk music,"
11772,A,"and, uh, a lot of it is, has a lot to say, or some of it has a lot to say, the music does, the lyrics do,"
11773,A,"but the, the actual,"
11774,B,"I don't think they have a whole lot to say, even"
11775,A,"Uh, well, it, it's, it's, it really expresses some of the opinions of, of the people who enjoy the music"
11776,B,"Yeah,"
11777,B,I guess.
11778,A,"um, but as far as a musical art form, I just don't see a whole lot of art to it"
11779,B,Uh-huh.
11780,A,Um.
11781,B,Do you like rap?
11782,A,"Um, some of it, um,"
11783,A,it depends.
11784,A,"I like, uh, the rap, the two types of rap I like, or I enjoy to listen to, and one is the, the rap that is just funny, um,"
11785,A,and they usually do a lot of satire
11786,B,Yeah
11787,A,um.
11788,B,that kind I kind of like.
11789,A,Right.
11790,B,"Some of it is kind of pointless,"
11791,A,"Right,"
11792,A,"the monotonous the monotonous,"
11793,B,yeah.
11794,A,no
11795,A,"that's not,"
11796,A,"I don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about, well, I'm better than you, and blah, blah, blah."
11797,B,Uh-huh.
11798,A,I don't like that.
11799,B,"Yeah,"
11800,B,yeah.
11801,A,"I like the funny, satire,"
11802,A,"and then some of it is, some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in urban society."
11803,B,Yeah.
11804,A,It really does.
11805,A,"It talks about, um, race relations and police relations"
11806,A,"and, um, that, that"
11807,B,I guess I don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times.
11808,A,Uh-huh.
11809,B,"Um, I'm, with you though,"
11810,B,I like classical
11811,A,Uh-huh.
11812,B,"um, I don't like to listen to it all the time, but, um, some of the time, anyway."
11813,B,"I like easy listening, just kind of, you know,"
11814,B,I guess I don't care much for rock and roll any more.
11815,B,"I used to like it all right,"
11816,B,but I don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason.
11817,B,"Um, let's see."
11818,B,"Country western, uh, I'm not quite as big on that."
11819,B,"Some of it's okay, uh"
11820,A,"Yeah,"
11821,A,"that's, that's about my opinion of that"
11822,B,yeah
11823,A,"It's, it's okay, um,"
11824,B,"Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess,"
11825,B,so
11826,A,"Um. The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is is, doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it"
11827,B,Yeah.
11828,A,"the, one country and western song sounds like every other, country and western"
11829,B,"a lot of them, sound, uh, really similar,"
11830,B,yeah.
11831,A,"and so the, the musicians don't get to really get into their music."
11832,A,They just play a certain number of chords
11833,B,Yeah.
11834,A,"the drummer plays a certain beat,"
11835,A,and you have a country and western song
11836,B,Um.
11837,A,"and,"
11838,B,"Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess."
11839,B,"They don't really,"
11840,B,"has kind of the same sound over and over,"
11841,B,and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are
11842,A,Um. Right.
11843,B,"you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them, too."
11844,A,Yeah.
11845,A,"And I can't say that I like a lot of the modern, the very, very modern, uh, rock and roll,"
11846,B,Yeah.
11847,A,"but I, I definitely, I really enjoy the fifties, the sixties and a lot, some of the seventies rock and roll"
11848,B,Yeah
11849,B,earlier things.
11850,A,"and, uh, I really enjoy, especially the sixties ..."
11851,A,Hello?
11852,B,Hi.
11853,A,"Hi,"
11854,A,my name is Leslie.
11855,B,"Hi,"
11856,B,I'm Jennifer.
11857,A,And where are you from?
11858,B,Pennsylvania.
11859,A,"Oh, nice,"
11860,A,"I'm from Dallas, Texas."
11861,B,"Oh, really?"
11862,A,"Yeah,"
11863,A,"so,"
11864,B,"Oh, that's neat."
11865,A,"Well, did you understand what this was for, you know, what it was for, what we,"
11866,B,"Uh, television shows?"
11867,A,Yeah
11868,B,"Sure,"
11869,B,that sounds good.
11870,A,Okay
11871,A,"I, I don't watch too many,"
11872,A,but we can try it.
11873,B,Okay.
11874,A,Are you ready to start?
11875,B,Sure am.
11876,A,"Okay,"
11877,A,just a minute
11878,B,"Okay,"
11879,B,I guess we're recording now.
11880,A,"Yeah,"
11881,A,okay.
11882,B,What are your favorite television shows?
11883,A,"Well, I don't really watch too many T V shows other than, uh, occasionally I'll, I'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here."
11884,B,"Oh, really?"
11885,A,"And, uh, so if, if there's no one else around, you know, it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something, I'll turn that on, but, uh, just for the, for the conversation factor, I think,"
11886,A,"but, and then I think I enjoy when I catch it, I don't even know what night it's on, but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes,"
11887,B,"Oh, I love that show."
11888,A,"Yeah,"
11889,A,do you?
11890,B,"Yes,"
11891,B,that is great.
11892,A,"Yeah,"
11893,A,it's fun.
11894,A,"And then there's a new one that started out that I've caught a couple of times called GOOD AND EVIL, I think."
11895,B,"Oh, I heard they just canceled that."
11896,A,"Oh, really?"
11897,B,I read in today's paper they just canceled that show.
11898,A,It is a real different one.
11899,A,"It's, uh, it's, it's different."
11900,A,I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.
11901,A,"But,"
11902,B,"Have you seen the show, it's, it's new this year, called HOME FRONT?"
11903,A,"No,"
11904,A,I haven't watched that.
11905,B,"Oh, it's, it's really good."
11906,B,"It's, uh, I think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven"
11907,A,Uh-huh.
11908,B,and it's set in post World War Two times
11909,B,and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through.
11910,B,It's really interesting.
11911,A,"Oh, yeah."
11912,B,It's kind of like a a nighttime soap opera type thing.
11913,A,Sounds neat.
11914,B,"It is, it's a good, it's really well written."
11915,A,Yeah.
11916,A,"Is that on, what what station?"
11917,B,"Uh, I don't even know, to tell you the truth"
11918,A,"Oh, okay."
11919,A,What other shows do you like?
11920,B,"Uh, I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE"
11921,A,"Oh, yeah."
11922,A,"Well, she comes on later"
11923,A,"and I usually have kids around so I don't end, end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it, I guess."
11924,B,Oh.
11925,B,"I did watch soap operas,"
11926,B,"but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore. Except when I'm home sick,"
11927,A,Yeah
11928,B,"and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?"
11929,A,That's right
11930,B,They're stupid
11931,A,Yeah.
11932,B,So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.
11933,A,Uh-huh.
11934,B,But not anymore.
11935,A,That can happen.
11936,A,"So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?"
11937,B,"Oh, uh, tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS."
11938,A,"Oh, that's always fun."
11939,B,"Yes,"
11940,B,I like that show.
11941,A,Yeah.
11942,B,"And if I can stay up late enough, I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then."
11943,A,"Oh, uh-huh."
11944,B,And right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live.
11945,A,"Oh, yeah."
11946,B,So
11947,A,Uh-huh.
11948,B,"It's exciting,"
11949,B,"we're winning,"
11950,B,so that's really exciting.
11951,A,"Yeah,"
11952,A,"well, I think,"
11953,A,"I also, course, like to catch the news during the evening hours"
11954,B,Uh-huh.
11955,A,"but, uh, it's a little tough because that's when I'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time."
11956,A,"So, usually I don't get a whole lot of news watching in."
11957,B,"Yes,"
11958,B,we watch C N N in morning while we're getting ready for the day and eating breakfast.
11959,A,Uh-huh.
11960,B,We'll catch our news that way.
11961,B,Watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like.
11962,A,"Yeah,"
11963,A,yeah.
11964,A,So what have you seen interesting on OPRAH WINFREY lately?
11965,B,"Lately, I haven't been catching it because of my work schedule."
11966,A,Uh-huh.
11967,B,"Uh, I can't remember the last time I saw it."
11968,B,It's been a while.
11969,A,"Yeah,"
11970,A,"well, I don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not"
11971,B,"I don't know,"
11972,B,"sometimes they come on and, and say."
11973,A,"Oh, that's right."
11974,B,"Well, today on C N N they were talking about something like this about, uh, learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing, helping them get a data base for words."
11975,A,"Um, yeah."
11976,B,It was really interesting.
11977,A,It is interesting.
11978,A,"So,"
11979,B,Do you work for Texas Instruments?
11980,A,"No,"
11981,A,"no,"
11982,A,"just, uh, doing this as a fund-raiser for our church."
11983,B,"Oh, that's nice."
11984,A,"Yeah,"
11985,A,"so it kind of makes it easy, you know, to do a little something for it."
11986,B,"Sure,"
11987,B,"because we, uh, we've talked to a lot of people from Texas, it seems,"
11988,B,"and we thought, well, maybe they work from, for Dallas,"
11989,A,All right.
11990,A,I think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight.
11991,B,"Which is movies,"
11992,B,correct?
11993,A,That is correct.
11994,B,Okay.
11995,A,Are you a movie buff?
11996,B,"Um, yeah."
11997,B,I don't like going to see them in the theaters
11998,B,"but outside of that, rent a lot,"
11999,B,watch them on T V mostly.
12000,A,"Well, I have a V C R"
12001,A,and I see most all of mine there.
12002,A,What have you seen recently that you enjoyed?
12003,B,"Uh, I don't know, um,"
12004,B,actually earlier tonight we were watching TO LIVE AND DIE IN L A.
12005,B,Have you seen that movie?
12006,A,"No,"
12007,A,I haven't.
12008,B,It's a kind of one of those psycho ones.
12009,A,"Now, I, I live alone."
12010,A,"Consequently, I don't like these psycho things."
12011,B,"Oh, it's not too bad."
12012,B,One of those cop thrillers
12013,B,"but,"
12014,A,"Oh, okay."
12015,A,Have you seen the
12016,A,"if,"
12017,A,do you have a V C R?
12018,B,"Yes,"
12019,B,we do.
12020,A,Have you seen the movie CLASS ACTION with Gene Hackman?
12021,B,"Uh, no,"
12022,B,I haven't yet.
12023,A,I saw it this weekend
12024,A,"and it is, uh, to me an outstanding movie."
12025,A,I thoroughly enjoyed it.
12026,A,"He is, uh, an attorney and his daughter is an attorney"
12027,A,and she has a suit against his company.
12028,A,"You know, it's one of those things."
12029,B,"Yeah,"
12030,B,"that,"
12031,A,But there's a lot of
12032,A,"well, it's just it's something that anyone can watch and enjoy."
12033,B,He's a good actor though.
12034,A,Beg your pardon?
12035,B,"Um, Gene Hackman's a good actor.  I think."
12036,A,"Yes,"
12037,A,he is.
12038,B,Do you see HOOSIERS?
12039,A,Yes.
12040,A,I've seen HOOSIERS.
12041,A,"Saw it just again the other night, for,"
12042,B,"Yeah,"
12043,B,"actually I, we saw her just the other night too."
12044,A,"Oh, did you?"
12045,B,Yeah.
12046,B,It's one of our favorite movies.
12047,B,"I, I live with, um, a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us."
12048,B,We've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months.
12049,A,"Have you seen the movie, um, CROSSING DELANCY?"
12050,B,Yeah.
12051,A,"Now, that's one I have watched, oh, six or eight times."
12052,A,I always feel so good when I get through with that movie.
12053,B,"Yeah,"
12054,B,I like those movies that you watch time and time again.
12055,A,I do too.
12056,A,DIRTY DANCING and CROSSING DELANCY are two of my favorite.
12057,A,"So, well what business are you in?"
12058,B,"I'm, I'm an electrical engineer."
12059,A,Oh.
12060,A,In New Hampshire.
12061,A,All right.
12062,B,I work in Massachusetts actually.
12063,A,"Oh, all right."
12064,A,Okay.
12065,A,So is everything going all right up there?
12066,B,"Um, it's only about, um, half an hour."
12067,B,I live on the border.
12068,A,"Oh, well that's that bad then."
12069,A,"Half an hour, we do that just going to downtown Dallas."
12070,B,That's right.
12071,A,"So,"
12072,B,See we live up in tax free New Hampshire and drive down to Massachusetts to work.
12073,A,That makes a lot of sense
12074,A,"But, um, we,"
12075,A,are you a native of that part of the country?
12076,B,"Yeah,"
12077,B,I grew up in New Hampshire.
12078,B,"It seems, southern town,"
12079,B,it's called
12080,B,"It's, I don't know, fifteen minutes from the border and five minutes from the main border. *main = Maine?"
12081,B,We live right in the corner.
12082,A,Oh.
12083,B,"That one little spot in New Hampshire, we have ten miles of coastline,"
12084,B,I live on one of that little ten mile spot.
12085,A,"Uh, sounds wonderful."
12086,A,Did you have damage this year with hurricanes?
12087,B,"Not up, um, where I live"
12088,B,but further down the coast in Massachusetts they got hit pretty bad.
12089,A,I happened to be in Nassau
12090,A,and we got the backlash of that thing.
12091,A,"And they had record high waves, thirty year high waves come in there,"
12092,A,and it was quite an experience
12093,A,so.
12094,A,"Well, what movies are you looking forward to seeing now?"
12095,B,"Um, well, I'm, I'm only twenty-seven years old"
12096,B,"so THE DOORS movie, that's out on video. I want to watch that."
12097,A,Okay.
12098,A,Have you seen GREEN CARD?
12099,B,That would be pretty good.
12100,B,"No,"
12101,B,I haven't seen that one.
12102,A,That's a real warm movie.
12103,A,"It, it really just turned out nicely."
12104,A,So I would recommend that if you have a chance.
12105,B,I'm in for it.
12106,B,We rent a lot of movies
12107,B,"so we, we often sit around and say, what movies should we rent?"
12108,B,And we don't know.
12109,A,"Well if you, if you can get GREEN CARD, go for it."
12110,B,"All right,"
12111,B,we'll try that one.
12112,A,"I have been working at, uh, as an accountant at the medical school here in Dallas"
12113,A,"and I have watched, uh, GROSS ANATOMY."
12114,A,Have you seen that one?
12115,B,"Yeah,"
12116,B,I did.
12117,A,Okay.
12118,A,And I don't know
12119,A,I can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students I see over at the medical school.
12120,A,But I hope you have a very Merry Christmas.
12121,B,You too.
12122,A,I'm looking forward to it.
12123,B,I think we're going to have a white Christmas up here just like the song says.
12124,A,"Well,"
12125,A,"Uh, well, uh, to begin,"
12126,A,"I guess, uh, space is, uh, real important, I think,"
12127,A,"so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time, I guess."
12128,A,So.
12129,B,"Yeah,"
12130,B,"I, I agree"
12131,A,Uh.
12132,B,it's definitely new frontier stuff.
12133,A,"So, uh,"
12134,A,"but, uh, I'm not too up-to-date on the space, on the space frontier,"
12135,A,"but, uh, I guess they're going, going pretty far into it now."
12136,A,"Um, Star Wars is not too far I don't think."
12137,A,"But, uh,"
12138,B,"I, I, I worked on some of it at T I once upon a time."
12139,A,"Oh, have you."
12140,B,Yeah.
12141,A,So what do you know about it.
12142,B,"Well, actually I'm, I, I'm quite versed lately."
12143,B,"I get on a computer network all the time,"
12144,B,"and people are talking about, about the current space program all the time."
12145,B,"They're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that, you know, are just like science fiction, you know,"
12146,B,"it's like they, take off, you know,"
12147,B,"and then they land, with the, with the, you know,"
12148,B,"the afterburners are going, you know, not like space shuttle landing, you know, gliding down, but straight down to the landing pad."
12149,A,Really.
12150,A,"Oh, my gosh."
12151,B,"Yeah,"
12152,B,it's called V C X or something like that.
12153,B,"Also called Delta Clipper, which is a decent name for something like that."
12154,A,Wow.
12155,A,"Well, I don't know."
12156,A,"You think you'd, you think you'd, uh, go up in space if you had a chance?"
12157,B,"Oh, yeah"
12158,A,"Do you,"
12159,B,I think I would.
12160,B,I think that'd be neat.
12161,A,"I think I would just sitting here talking about it,"
12162,A,"but if the time came, it'd be real nervous."
12163,A,"I'd be scared,"
12164,A,scared me worse than Six Flags roller coaster.
12165,A,That'd be pretty hairy.
12166,B,"Well, you know, I had a car, uh, uh, a tire come off of a car,"
12167,B,"so you know, I, like I know what it's like to"
12168,A,"Yeah,"
12169,A,imagine.
12170,B,Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home
12171,A,"Right,"
12172,A,right.
12173,A,"So, well, I guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff, now, wherever. And opening up those stations, whatever, filling them."
12174,B,"Yeah,"
12175,B,"they're talking about doing that again, too."
12176,B,Uh-huh.
12177,A,I don't know if we'll ever see that up there.
12178,B,Well at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years.
12179,A,"Oh, really."
12180,B,"Yeah,"
12181,B,"and they're going to put,"
12182,A,That's all beyond my imagination really.
12183,B,Yeah.
12184,A,"But, science fiction books,"
12185,A,"I mean, you look at the Jetsons, you know, cartoon show, and it's not too far fetched what, what they all had in those cartoons,"
12186,A,so you never know.
12187,B,"Oh, yeah,"
12188,B,yeah.
12189,A,"Any of that stuff from the Jetsons, from that cartoon, that you would never imagine would come, become possible, and now you, we have a lot of those,"
12190,A,"so,"
12191,B,Uh-huh.
12192,A,"So you never know what, what may occur,"
12193,A,"but as far as me seeing it, you know, I don't know"
12194,B,Yeah.
12195,A,"I don't know,"
12196,A,"but I think it's real vital important for the future, you know generations to come,"
12197,B,Uh-huh.
12198,A,so.
12199,B,"Yeah,"
12200,B,"I, uh,"
12201,B,"it's, it's, it's something definitely that, uh, you know,"
12202,B,"it's, it's, uh, got the extra little oomph of interest."
12203,A,Yeah.
12204,B,Uh.
12205,A,"I'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too, once it becomes, you know, like it's more possible,"
12206,A,"but when they start showing the drawings and all that, I'm sure, you know, when they,"
12207,B,Yeah.
12208,B,"Yeah,"
12209,B,"I wish, uh,"
12210,B,"like, uh, Boeing or McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy, uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial"
12211,A,Right.
12212,A,Uh-huh.
12213,B,"and they'd go up, you know, and do things"
12214,B,"and,"
12215,A,"So did they scratch those, uh, that Star Wars deal, you know, they one we was all worried about the ""they"" in this sentence should probably be a Russia and all that?"
12216,B,Oh.
12217,B,"No,"
12218,B,"it's still probably going,"
12219,B,"but I don't know whether, it, it, research will go on."
12220,A,"Yeah,"
12221,A,"but the economy the way it is all over, they probably cut back on on that, because it's not,"
12222,B,"Oh, yeah."
12223,B,"Well, they're, they're going to be cutting back so much on just, you know, the number of troops we've got in Europe and the number of troops we have here."
12224,A,Right.
12225,A,"Yeah,"
12226,A,"I know,"
12227,A,"and then,"
12228,B,"But, uh, Russia's still going to have missiles,"
12229,B,they're still going to be subs and things.
12230,A,"Yeah,"
12231,A,and we don't know who's handling them now
12232,B,Yeah.
12233,A,so that's a whole different story now.
12234,B,"Latest I heard it was just going to be Russia that, Russia itself that was going to have them."
12235,A,"Oh, really."
12236,B,"At least that was, you know, that's what everybody says."
12237,B,"Oh, yeah,"
12238,B,"yeah,"
12239,B,we want only Russia to have them.
12240,A,Uh-huh.
12241,B,"And now they're saying, Yeah,"
12242,B,"yeah,"
12243,B,"you're a republic,"
12244,B,"you don't want those,"
12245,B,you don't want those.
12246,A,"Some crazy hit man over there so, with those little republics or whatever"
12247,A,"they splitting it all up now,"
12248,A,"and one of them crazy crazy guys get a hold of it,"
12249,B,Uh-huh.
12250,A,you never know.
12251,A,"But that, the guy that's taken over for Gorbachev, he's supposed to be, he's supposed to be on our side, isn't he."
12252,A,Pretty much.
12253,B,One hopes.
12254,A,Uh-huh.
12255,A,I think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects
12256,A,"so,"
12257,B,Uh-huh.
12258,A,"But that way, you can't never tell that."
12259,B,Yeah.
12260,A,"Kiss some butt,"
12261,A,"but, but, uh,"
12262,A,"Well, Michael, what do you think about, uh, funding for AIDS research?"
12263,A,"Do you,"
12264,B,"Well, uh, uh, that's something I've thought a lot about."
12265,A,Uh-huh.
12266,B,"Uh, I, I work in a hospital."
12267,A,Uh-huh.
12268,B,And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years
12269,B,and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients.
12270,A,Uh-huh.
12271,B,"Uh, when they asked us did, did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, I think uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, my, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for."
12272,A,Yeah.
12273,A,Uh-huh.
12274,A,Uh-huh.
12275,B,I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with
12276,A,Yeah.
12277,B,"or I think they already would have by now, you know."
12278,A,Uh-huh.
12279,B,"And, uh, so I don't know if, if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now."
12280,B,"I think they're doing the, is as much research as they can possibly do, you know."
12281,A,Uh-huh.
12282,B,"And, uh, what about you?"
12283,A,"Well, I guess I'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now You know."
12284,B,I'm not either.
12285,B,I'm definitely not aware of how much.
12286,A,Yeah.
12287,B,"Uh, that's something I've never really kept up with at all."
12288,A,"Uh-huh,"
12289,A,yeah.
12290,B,"Uh, I don't,  I'm not sure, uh,"
12291,A,"I mean, I,"
12292,A,go ahead.
12293,B,"I know, uh, I've always thought more about the disease rather than the research,"
12294,B,you know what I mean?
12295,A,Uh-huh.
12296,A,Yeah.
12297,B,"And, uh, that sort of thing."
12298,B,"Uh, if, if we were talking about the money, uh, I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough, simply because I don't know that much about it. You know"
12299,A,Yeah.
12300,A,Yeah.
12301,A,"I mean, I, I can see that research is needed"
12302,A,"and, you know,"
12303,B,"Oh, yeah."
12304,A,Definitely.
12305,B,"I think so,"
12306,B,I think so.
12307,A,I mean it's becoming a major problem.
12308,B,Yeah.
12309,A,"But, uh. I guess the area that I think more about is I would like to see them focus on, uh, preventing it, uh in more, You know."
12310,B,Yeah.
12311,B,Yeah.
12312,B,"Well, that's true."
12313,B,"That's true because, uh, it's a, such an easily preventable disease."
12314,A,"Right,"
12315,A,"and I, I feel like just saying, uh, safe sex is not the answer."
12316,B,"Uh,"
12317,A,"It's it's, uh abstinence in certain cases"
12318,B,No.
12319,B,It's definitely not.
12320,A,and
12321,B,"That's true,"
12322,B,that's true.
12323,A,Yeah.
12324,B,"Uh,"
12325,A,"And, knowing, you know,"
12326,B,"Myself, uh, uh, I'm just recently, or about to, get a divorce"
12327,A,Uh-huh.
12328,B,"and, uh, course, I'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody I can or anything."
12329,A,Yeah.
12330,B,"But, it's sort of scary to find yourself single again, you know."
12331,A,Uh-huh.
12332,B,"And, uh, because you never know what's going to happen"
12333,B,"You don't know who you're going to come across, you know."
12334,A,Yeah.
12335,B,"Course, it's, it's not that I'm wanting to, I'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody I see."
12336,A,Uh-huh.
12337,B,But it's something you got to think about these days.
12338,A,Yeah.
12339,B,"A single person. You know,"
12340,A,Uh-huh.
12341,B,"and, uh, I mean, it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry."
12342,A,Yeah.
12343,A,Yeah.
12344,B,"And, uh,"
12345,A,I think for a lot of people it has.
12346,B,Certainly.
12347,A,"So,"
12348,B,Yeah.
12349,A,"So,"
12350,B,"But, uh, uh, I know that, uh, in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing to prevent, you know, so that, uh, the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything."
12351,A,Uh-huh.
12352,A,Drug addicts.
12353,A,Uh-huh.
12354,A,Yeah.
12355,B,"And, uh, I don't know,"
12356,B,I don't think that's a bad idea.
12357,A,Uh-huh.
12358,B,"I know it, uh, sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction"
12359,A,Yeah.
12360,B,It just sort of keeps that going.
12361,A,Yeah.
12362,B,"But, uh, I don't know,"
12363,B,"at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS, so far, cannot be. You know,"
12364,A,Uh-huh.
12365,B,"so, I don't know,"
12366,B,"that, I think that's,"
12367,B,"I'm not too much against the, the passing out of the free syringes myself."
12368,A,Uh-huh.
12369,B,"I don't know,"
12370,B,what do you think about that? It really is.
12371,A,"Well, yeah,"
12372,A,boy that's a hard issue
12373,A,It really is.
12374,B,It really is.
12375,B,They gave us a hard topic
12376,A,Yeah
12377,A,"I mean, I, I definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed,"
12378,A,"but as you say, uh, people, I mean, in the meantime,"
12379,A,"well someone who's not ready to give up drugs, uh, You know."
12380,B,Uh-huh.
12381,B,That's true.
12382,B,That's true.
12383,A,"If they're perpetrating the AIDS problem, passing that on to each other, then  you know,"
12384,B,Yeah.
12385,B,"You know, I guess if you consider the two problems, drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have to come first, I guess, as far as something to, to do about it."
12386,A,Yeah.
12387,A,Yeah.
12388,A,Uh-huh.
12389,B,"So, so I don't know."
12390,B,"Uh, course, there's so many things in the world where, if you solve one problem, you may be creating another you know."
12391,A,Yeah.
12392,B,"And, uh, so I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse. Which is the most important to solve at the time"
12393,A,Yeah.
12394,B,"and,"
12395,A,Uh-huh.
12396,B,I don't know.
12397,A,Yeah.
12398,B,"But, uh, but I've never looked into how much money they're spending."
12399,B,"I have, I have no idea."
12400,A,Uh-huh.
12401,B,And I know a lot of our tax money goes to that.
12402,A,Yeah.
12403,B,"But, uh, I really have never looked into it."
12404,B,I have no idea.
12405,A,"Yeah,"
12406,A,I haven't either.
12407,A,"I've heard, you know, uh different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough"
12408,B,Yeah.
12409,B,Yeah.
12410,A,"and, Mostly that's what I've heard,"
12411,B,"Right,"
12412,B,sure.
12413,A,"so I don't know,"
12414,B,Yeah.
12415,A,"And, yet, I know it's, uh, it sounds like big money to me"
12416,B,Yeah
12417,A,But it  probably takes  a lot.
12418,B,I think it is.
12419,B,I think it is.
12420,B,"Yeah,"
12421,B,"it does every,"
12422,A,"So,"
12423,B,"It seems to take more than, uh, for any little thing they do,"
12424,B,it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would. You know.
12425,A,Uh-huh.
12426,A,Yeah.
12427,B,"But, uh,"
12428,A,"Did you have any fear working in the hospital with that,"
12429,B,That's one thing I've never really feared.
12430,A,Uh-huh.
12431,B,"Uh, uh, I,"
12432,B,"a lot of the, my family, you know, they fear me working like that and, under some, some of those conditions,"
12433,B,"but, uh uh, I don't fear it at all."
12434,A,Uh-huh.
12435,A,Uh-huh.
12436,B,"Uh, I work in, in the operating room a lot"
12437,A,Uh-huh.
12438,B,"and, uh, and, of course, when"
12439,A,Hello?
12440,B,Hello.
12441,A,How you doing?
12442,B,Fine.
12443,A,"I'm Lee with, uh, uh,"
12444,A,"I'm over here in Plano, Texas."
12445,B,Okay.
12446,B,"Let me ask you something, can I run a minute and shut my radio off?"
12447,A,"Oh, sure."
12448,B,Okay.
12449,A,Oh.
12450,B,Okay.
12451,A,Where are you calling from
12452,A,or where are you at?
12453,B,Arlington.
12454,B,"Arlington, Texas."
12455,A,Arlington.
12456,B,Yes.
12457,A,"Well, there's a lot of stuff going on in Arlington these days."
12458,B,"Yes,"
12459,B,not all good stuff.
12460,A,Are you involved in any of that?
12461,B,No.
12462,A,No.
12463,B,"No,"
12464,B,"I'm not, not personally."
12465,A,"Well, uh, what benefits do,"
12466,A,"now, do you work?"
12467,B,I'm going to school right now.
12468,A,"Oh, you are?"
12469,B,I can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what I think.
12470,A,Okay.
12471,A,Yeah.
12472,B,"I've got a lot of,"
12473,A,"Because I, I work for myself"
12474,B,Uh-huh.
12475,A,"and so, uh, there's a lot that I, that I guess I do miss, uh, a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation."
12476,A,"I miss, uh insurance and uh, the steady paychecks that come."
12477,B,Yes.
12478,B,Right.
12479,B,Yes.
12480,A,"But, uh,"
12481,B,"Yes,"
12482,B,"I've been in my own business, Mary Kay, in fact,"
12483,B,I'm selling in out now to go to school full time
12484,B,"and I enjoyed the freedom of having that, you know,"
12485,A,"Oh, is that right?"
12486,B,go to work when I wanted to or not
12487,A,Uh-huh.
12488,B,"but, you know, the benefits weren't there."
12489,A,Yeah.
12490,B,"So,"
12491,A,"I, uh, I own part of a roofing company."
12492,B,"Oh, do you?"
12493,A,"In the, in the Dallas, Fort Worth area."
12494,B,Uh-huh.
12495,A,"And, uh, you know, unfortunately we, we were part of a, of a bigger, bigger company"
12496,B,Uh-huh.
12497,A,"and they, uh, you know, we, we had all the benefits there"
12498,A,"and, and I do miss that. You know,"
12499,B,Yeah.
12500,A,"but, uh, on the other hand, I, I, uh, I enjoy having the, the time that I have with my family and being able to, you know, work when I want"
12501,B,Right.
12502,B,"Yeah,"
12503,B,uh-huh.
12504,A,"and,"
12505,B,"I think today the thing that I, uh, would appreciate the most,"
12506,B,"uh, because my husband gets, his medical through his company,"
12507,B,but we have to pay for mine
12508,A,Uh-huh.
12509,B,"and we're the only one, I'm the only one that's being insured"
12510,B,"and and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has, I mean,"
12511,A,"Oh, is that right?"
12512,B,"so it's kind of,"
12513,A,Yeah.
12514,B,"And I would,"
12515,B,"I really,"
12516,B,and the way medical expenses are I think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to you need to have.
12517,A,"It's,"
12518,A,Yeah.
12519,A,"It, it,"
12520,A,"Yeah,"
12521,A,"I'll tell you what,"
12522,A,"that is the single most uh, benefit that I, that I enjoyed, and I do miss"
12523,B,Right.
12524,A,"because I looked into picking up some, uh, medical insurance for my, just for my family, you know, just,"
12525,A,and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it.
12526,B,It's out of sight.
12527,B,"Right,"
12528,B,it's out of sight.
12529,A,"And, uh, yeah,"
12530,B,"Even at a group rate, I couldn't believe how much is our,"
12531,A,"Oh, yeah"
12532,A,even at a group rate.
12533,A,"Uh, it's, it's unbelievable"
12534,A,"and, uh, the amount that you have to pay for, you know, for kids"
12535,A,"and, and if you want to add dental to it, I mean, that's  that eats even more."
12536,B,"Right,"
12537,B,it goes up.
12538,B,Right.
12539,A,"So, yeah,"
12540,A,"I guess what, the other benefits that, uh, that I, uh, that I miss, I guess is, uh, you know, some of the bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company, you know"
12541,B,Uh-huh.
12542,A,"and course, these days, you can't count on that because"
12543,B,Right.
12544,A,"uh, you know, I feel bad for the people that are involved in that, uh, G M deal there in in Arlington"
12545,B,Right.
12546,A,"and I'm sure it will be, you know, quite a few people are affected by that"
12547,A,"so,"
12548,B,"Right,"
12549,B,"it's going to hurt the city,"
12550,B,"although, uh, I will personally tell you, I used to work at a bank,"
12551,B,"and I would see the G M people come in when they were, they would shut down to retool."
12552,A,Uh-huh.
12553,B,They were paid that whole time
12554,B,"and I don't know, if you're aware of this"
12555,A,"Oh, really?"
12556,B,"Yes,"
12557,B,"they come in there,"
12558,B,"just, they go off fishing and stuff and come in and, every Friday, and go to the safety deposit box,"
12559,B,"and I'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week, you know"
12560,B,"and, And they had all these"
12561,A,Is that right?
12562,B,"I, I really believe they have done this to themselves, in a way, because of the unions being so stocked."
12563,A,"The union,"
12564,A,yeah.
12565,B,"And right now, anybody's that's laid off from G M will have a full year's paycheck."
12566,B,I just read this in the paper the other day.
12567,A,Is that right?
12568,B,"Plus probably an additional six months through the, the worker's stuff that they have at, at, uh, through the company"
12569,B,"so I'm you know, I'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt,"
12570,A,Yeah.
12571,B,"but I don't feel as sorry for them,"
12572,A,Well
12573,B,"If my husband  were laid off tomorrow, we'd get one more check"
12574,A,"really the,"
12575,B,and that would be it.
12576,A,"Yeah,"
12577,A,"really the ones it's going to hurt is, is actually the, the businesses around in that area."
12578,B,Yes.
12579,B,"Oh, yeah,"
12580,B,that's already hurting.
12581,A,"You know, that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that, uh,"
12582,B,"But I think there's a case, where benefits have gotten,"
12583,B,they voted them in
12584,B,"and they got so good, I mean, like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical, all these things, you know"
12585,A,"Oh, yeah."
12586,A,Yeah.
12587,B,and it made the prices of cars go up
12588,B,"and and, you know, the,"
12589,A,Uh-huh.
12590,B,"I, we, I believe in unions,"
12591,B,but they went too far.
12592,A,"Well, I'll tell you, I I've had my fill of unions"
12593,B,"I mean, I can't make eighteen dollars an hour."
12594,A,"I,"
12595,B,"I mean, I know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour."
12596,A,"Oh, yeah."
12597,A,Okay.
12598,A,"Uh, do you want to go ahead"
12599,A,"or,"
12600,B,"Oh, sure."
12601,B,"Uh, well I, uh, went to school at Madison for two years"
12602,B,"and they are really big on women's rights. And, and equal treatment."
12603,A,Uh-huh.
12604,A,Uh-huh.
12605,B,"And so I, I've seen a lot of like rallies and things like that."
12606,B,"But, uh, I'm not that liberated."
12607,B,"I mean my mom is kind of old-fashioned, you know."
12608,A,Uh-huh.
12609,B,"So, I, you know, you pick up some traits from her and stuff."
12610,B,"But, uh, I think it's, I think it's interesting and better for women to see that there's more, more of them doing men's fields."
12611,B,I like to see that.
12612,B,"And  I don't like to see women, you know, like waiting on men hand and foot"
12613,A,Right.
12614,B,"but, you know, I, I believe in like sharing and doing things for each other."
12615,A,I do too.
12616,A,I like the idea.
12617,A,"I see a lot more, uh,"
12618,A,"my children, I have five children"
12619,A,and they're all married.
12620,B,Uh-huh.
12621,A,"And, uh, I love seeing the men help the women so much."
12622,B,Right.
12623,A,"And they both cooperate together on,"
12624,A,I think it's great.
12625,B,"Oh, me too"
12626,B,I hope that happens to me someday.
12627,B,"I mean, I, I don't mind  doing stuff."
12628,B,"Uh, I have a boyfriend"
12629,B,and I got to make him dinner and stuff
12630,B,"but, you know, I, he'll help me do the dishes."
12631,B,"I don't want to, you know expect to help to clean up then after"
12632,A,Right.
12633,B,Yeah.
12634,A,That's right.
12635,A,That's right.
12636,B,Yeah.
12637,B,So
12638,A,I've always taught my men that.
12639,A,They better clean up with their women and help them.
12640,A,"If they did that, you know."
12641,B,Right.
12642,A,"And they're, they're good about it."
12643,A,But it is neat to see them all work together.
12644,A,"And  a big thing that I see. All that, most of the, most of the women getting married now, uh, go back, have gone back to, you know,"
12645,B,Uh-huh.
12646,A,"they, they stay at work or go back to work. Or whatever."
12647,B,Right.
12648,A,And they're well educated.
12649,B,Uh-huh.
12650,A,And I believe we'll see a lot more C E O in companies.
12651,A,They're having a fit about how little there are.
12652,B,Oh.
12653,A,"And I think we'll see a lot more. Don't you? Of upper management? Then we do now, even."
12654,B,"Oh, yeah."
12655,B,Uh-huh.
12656,B,Right.
12657,A,I think it'll escalate.
12658,B,Yeah.
12659,A,"And, uh, and I think black women now"
12660,A,in fact I work at a high school.
12661,B,Uh-huh.
12662,A,And my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted
12663,A,and she's very sharp.
12664,A,And I think that
12665,A,"and the ethnic thing will be, you know, is a good thing now."
12666,B,"Oh, me too."
12667,A,They're moving them up
12668,A,and they're sharp
12669,A,"and they,"
12670,A,"so you're going to see a lot, a lot more of that in leadership I believe."
12671,B,Yeah.
12672,B,I like to see that.
12673,B,"I think it's, uh, really neat to see and all that educated minority, uh, person  who really knows what they're talking about."
12674,A,Uh-huh.  Right.
12675,B,"And it's just too bad that some people, you know, still look down on them just because of their color. You know."
12676,A,Right.
12677,A,That's
12678,B,Especially black women.
12679,A,Yes.
12680,B,So.
12681,A,Yeah.
12682,A,But they know what they're doing.
12683,B,Right.
12684,A,But I'm not big on subserving as far as  to the men at all.
12685,B,Uh-huh.
12686,B,Right.
12687,A,"But I never have gone along with that, you know. Even far back."
12688,A,"But I was brought up pretty good in a home that,"
12689,A,years ago my mother was that way.
12690,A,The same.
12691,A,"I,"
12692,A,my
12693,A,"you know,"
12694,A,some people say oh the boys shouldn't have to do those jobs. The inside jobs.
12695,A,"But we never were taught,"
12696,A,they had to do as much as we did.
12697,A,So that was good.
12698,B,"Right,"
12699,B,same here.
12700,B,Yeah.
12701,A,"So that's, I think that's good. To keep the equal as far as, as, uh, not, uh, necessarily by sex type thing.  You know."
12702,B,Right.
12703,B,Same here.
12704,A,You should be able to accomplish as much.
12705,A,"And I think the, uh, attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now."
12706,B,Uh-huh.
12707,A,"You see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls, you know  you can do it."
12708,B,Yeah.
12709,A,"If he  can do it, you can do it type thing."
12710,B,Yeah.
12711,B,Exactly.
12712,B,"I, I see more men, uh, like participating in like the family things with children. Like, you know, helping to take care of them more. And and, uh, uh, doing the jobs equally, you know,"
12713,A,Uh-huh.
12714,A,Uh-huh.
12715,A,Right.
12716,A,What about politics on it?
12717,B,Oh.
12718,A,Do you think the political scene?
12719,B,I'm not that big on politics.
12720,B,I'm not that educated on it.
12721,A,Yeah.
12722,B,"I'm,"
12723,A,I'm real I'm kind of disgusted this year because I don't see many women into the political scene
12724,A,"and I really think we should have more political leaders in the women than we do up for, and even for President and Vice President this year,"
12725,B,"Oh, yeah."
12726,B,I agree with that.
12727,A,there's nobody again.
12728,A,"I think they're all scared out after after, uh,"
12729,A,"oh, what was the lady's name that ran a couple of,"
12730,A,I forget her name now.
12731,B,"Oh, I don't know"
12732,A,But you know who I mean?
12733,B,"Yeah,"
12734,B,I know who you're talking about.
12735,A,Yeah.
12736,A,She took such a rough go of it.
12737,A,"And they their tax deal and,"
12738,B,Yeah.
12739,B,At least she was strong to like try it and you know.
12740,A,Right.
12741,A,Right.
12742,B,So that's good.
12743,A,But I wish they would get some more on that.
12744,A,I really was disappointed this year when I see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about.
12745,A,"Uh, they, I didn't see any of the women in there."
12746,B,Uh-huh.
12747,A,And that disappoints me.
12748,B,Oh.
12749,A,"And right now I don't think we have too many. Uh, in the forefront."
12750,A,Schroeder's about the biggest one in Washington.
12751,B,Uh-huh.
12752,A,Congress woman.
12753,A,"And, uh, other uh,"
12754,A,"we really,"
12755,A,Okay.
12756,A,"I think the first thing they said,"
12757,A,I have written this down
12758,A,"so it would,"
12759,A,is it do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government?
12760,B,Okay.
12761,B,"You're asking what my opinion about,  whether it's possible to have honesty in government."
12762,A,Yeah.
12763,B,"Well, I suspect that it is possible."
12764,B,"Uh, I think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody."
12765,A,Right.
12766,A,That's a good point.
12767,B,"But, uh, other than that I think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty."
12768,A,"That's an you know, that's interesting."
12769,A,I had read something one time
12770,A,"and it was just applying to governments in general,"
12771,A,it was written many years ago.
12772,A,It said that it's impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers.
12773,A,And I thought that was interesting.
12774,A,It wasn't just talking about our government.
12775,A,"It was just government in general. From times past, you know on"
12776,B,Uh-huh.
12777,A,"and,"
12778,B,So they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers.
12779,A,Right.
12780,A,And that would be a next question to ask.
12781,A,"or are they in there for their own gains,"
12782,A,"and personally I feel it's probably, there's probably some of each."
12783,B,Right.
12784,B,Yeah.
12785,B,"But I think maybe a lot of them, um,"
12786,B,"say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves, it may be more matter of not what can I steal while in an office but how many friends can I make while,  I'm in office."
12787,A,Uh-huh.
12788,A,Yeah.
12789,B,"And, you know, how good a name can I make for myself and so forth."
12790,B,So I guess it would be like anything else.
12791,A,Yeah.
12792,B,"The president of General Motors probably has the same,"
12793,A,"Oh, yeah."
12794,A,"And they talked, uh,"
12795,A,"the other, let's see."
12796,A,"Third question was how serving for their own gains do you think goes on,"
12797,A,"then they,"
12798,A,that's hard to
12799,A,"I'm sure there's a lot. But I agree with you, there's a lot in business."
12800,A,"I think that's just, I think that's very normal,  that we should not I think,"
12801,B,"I think  I think a little more honesty in the campaigns would be,  more to the point."
12802,A,I think we put too much on politicians.
12803,A,"We expect them to only be there to serve us, you know."
12804,A,Yeah.
12805,B,"If you knew what you were getting when you voted, uh,"
12806,A,"That's a problem, isn't it?"
12807,B,Yeah.
12808,A,It's interesting
12809,A,"because I'm taking a Texas government class right now,"
12810,A,and one of the things
12811,A,it's so easy to blame them to
12812,A,a lot of times I think it's our own fault.
12813,A,They lie to us because we don't want to hear the truth.
12814,B,"Yeah,"
12815,B,"they say you,  get the government you deserve."
12816,A,"And it,"
12817,A,"If they tell us the truth, we don't elect them and, Especially with all this stuff coming up here lately about people's past,"
12818,B,Uh-huh
12819,A,and I don't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore.
12820,B,It's hard to imagine.
12821,A,"Because it's, I think it's gotten just well,"
12822,A,we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life
12823,A,"and, and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at"
12824,B,"Yeah,"
12825,B,"and it almost seems like in order to avoid, uh, some of the scandal, you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find, on, say in the Bobsy twins or,  something like that"
12826,A,Right.
12827,A,"You know, I also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out."
12828,A,I don't think there would be too many left
12829,B,So you're taking a government course?
12830,A,Uh-huh.
12831,B,At what?
12832,B,The university?
12833,A,"Uh, at, uh, it's T C J C."
12834,A,Tarrant County Junior College.
12835,B,Oh.
12836,A,Yeah.
12837,B,Okay.
12838,A,"And it's really, it's really enjoyable."
12839,A,I like it.
12840,A,"And then they also, you know, ask can we eliminate, do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption,"
12841,A,and I don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally.
12842,B,You can make laws against corruption
12843,A,"Yeah,"
12844,A,"but that,  doesn't mean,"
12845,B,"But that doesn't eliminate it, does it?   Milwaukee, did it?"
12846,A,I don't think making laws will stop it.
12847,A,I mean I don't know how many laws you would have to have.
12848,A,"I mean,"
12849,A,"No,"
12850,A,"sure didn't,  did it?"
12851,A,"So no,"
12852,A,I think you can legislate
12853,A,"but I think there's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating,"
12854,A,"and we would end up with so many more laws that, you know,"
12855,A,"I mean I just think that's human nature that you're going to have corruption in government, in business, personal life, I mean, you know."
12856,B,"Actually, I think other countries may have it worse, uh,"
12857,B,"the Japanese government is always having a, some kind of a scandal."
12858,A,Right.
12859,B,Usually involving the Prime Minister or people very close to him.
12860,A,Yeah.
12861,B,"So, uh,"
12862,A,"Yeah,"
12863,A,I still believe I get very fed up with government sometimes
12864,A,"but when I think about where I'd want to go, you know, this is still the best"
12865,A,"or I can,"
12866,B,"Yeah,"
12867,B,I've been around to a few other countries
12868,B,"and I, uh, I, I have not found one yet that I would rather live in."
12869,B,"I think, uh,"
12870,A,Yeah.
12871,A,"Yeah,"
12872,A,at its worst I think we've got the best.
12873,A,"Okay, um, Chuck, do you have any pets there at your home?"
12874,B,"Yeah, I do."
12875,A,And what kind do you have?
12876,B,I've got a male Siamese about a year old here.
12877,B,"I live alone in an apartment, and, uh,  except for the cat."
12878,A,Uh-huh.
12879,A,Uh-huh
12880,B,How about you?
12881,A,"Well, we have a cat, um,"
12882,A,"he's probably, oh, a good two years old, big, old, fat and sassy tabby."
12883,B,Uh-huh.
12884,A,"Oh. Uh, how's the disposition of your Siamese cat?"
12885,B,"Well, it's, uh, you know they're just, uh, aggressive by nature"
12886,A,Uh-huh.
12887,B,"and, uh, he's been neutered and declawed,"
12888,B,"so  he's an indoor cat,"
12889,A,Uh-huh.
12890,B,"so, uh, that kind of calms him down for the most part."
12891,B,How about yours?
12892,A,"Well, yeah,"
12893,A,"he's, uh, he has been really aggressive, uh, especially towards my little girl, for some reason."
12894,B,Huh.
12895,A,"He's, uh, been so mean to her"
12896,B,"And, and you say you've had him how long?"
12897,A,We've had him for about two years
12898,B,Two years.
12899,A,"and he was so mean to her, um, right after we first got him."
12900,A,"So we had him neutered, and, and declawed,"
12901,A,and now he bites her.
12902,A,"He can't scratch her any more,"
12903,B,Huh.
12904,A,he bites her.
12905,B,Does he bite her enough to draw blood?
12906,A,"Yeah,"
12907,A,"yeah,"
12908,A,"he has a couple of times,"
12909,A,so.
12910,B,Uh-huh.
12911,A,But he's a very possessive cat.
12912,A,"He, he loves my son,"
12913,A,"it's his cat,"
12914,A,and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him
12915,B,Yeah.
12916,A,"and he's so funny,"
12917,A,he just follows my son around just like a dog.
12918,B,Huh.
12919,A,He won't even let my son shower.
12920,B,Yeah.
12921,A,He meows and wants to get in the bathroom
12922,A,"and, while he showers, it's so hilarious."
12923,A,So he's quite a animal
12924,B,"Yeah,"
12925,B,"boy,"
12926,B,I guess.
12927,B,Well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive. I guess with the daughter he's all right.
12928,A,Yeah.
12929,B,You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something.
12930,A,"Yeah,"
12931,A,"well, we, we did, uh, actually take him to the pound a couple of times, you know because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl,"
12932,B,Uh-huh.
12933,B,Sure.
12934,A,"but, uh, he seems to have mellowed out a little bit,"
12935,A,and we do keep our daughter away from him.
12936,A,So.
12937,B,"Yeah,"
12938,B,yeah.
12939,A,"Were it not for my son, the cat would not be in this house"
12940,B,Is that the only pet that you have?
12941,A,"It is,"
12942,A,uh-huh.
12943,A,"We, we tried a dog about four years ago, and we ended up with, uh, oh, malamute and some other kind of mix."
12944,A,"Anyway it was, it ended up being just a huge, huge dog that ate us out of house and home."
12945,A,"So, we gave him up and tried."
12946,B,"Well, do you live, you, you in a house, or a place where you, uh,"
12947,A,"Yes,"
12948,A,"uh-huh,"
12949,A,"we're in a house,"
12950,A,"but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog,"
12951,B,I see.
12952,A,"we couldn't allow him to run free,"
12953,A,"so, he was just chained up all the time,"
12954,A,"and it was, it was  unfortunate."
12955,B,Sure.
12956,A,So have you tried any other pets?
12957,B,"No,"
12958,B,no.
12959,B,"I, I live alone in an apartment,"
12960,B,"and, uh, it's, it's not that big that, uh"
12961,A,Oh
12962,B,although I've heard rabbits are pretty good
12963,A,Oh.
12964,B,"you know, I saw something on C N N or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses,"
12965,A,Uh-huh.
12966,A,"Oh, my word."
12967,B,"and they apparently, uh,"
12968,B,especially when they're young when they bring them in
12969,A,"Oh, my word."
12970,B,"uh,"
12971,A,"And do they, they just paper train it or something?"
12972,B,I guess.
12973,B,"I guess,"
12974,B,"yeah,"
12975,B,"and I would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with, either."
12976,A,Yeah.
12977,A,"Well, rabbits are darling."
12978,A,That would be fun if you could get them trained.
12979,A,Otherwise they're pretty smelly
12980,B,"Yep,"
12981,B,that's right.
12982,A,Oh.
12983,B,"Did you see the, the C N N, the, the dog show, uh,"
12984,A,"Huh-uh,"
12985,A,"we don't have C, we don't have cable."
12986,B,I see.
12987,B,"Well they have, uh, uh, a they call it the Westminster Dog Show, uh,"
12988,B,"I think it's in New York City at the, at the Gardens"
12989,B,there once a year live
12990,A,Oh.
12991,B,"and they had that on last week,"
12992,B,"and that's really kind of something  to watch, uh,"
12993,A,Oh.
12994,B,"it's on, I think, two or three nights for maybe an hour or two"
12995,A,Is that right?
12996,B,and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there.
12997,A,Oh
12998,B,"Some of them are really beautiful, too."
12999,A,Uh-huh.
13000,B,So.
13001,A,"Well, I'd be, interesting to watch."
13002,B,So you live in Utah do you?
13003,A,"Yes,"
13004,A,uh-huh.
13005,A,Elton.
13006,B,Goodness.
13007,A,"We live out here by, it's by Ogden."
13008,A,"It's north of Salt Lake City, Utah"
13009,B,Uh-huh.
13010,A,and we really love it out here.
13011,A,"It's, uh, kind of country."
13012,A,"We're, we're only about ten minutes from Ogden."
13013,B,Uh-huh.
13014,A,"So, we're kind of country but not too."
13015,B,"Well do you all work for T I, or for,"
13016,A,"No,"
13017,A,huh-uh.
13018,A,Do you?
13019,B,"Yeah,"
13020,B,"yeah,"
13021,B,yeah.
13022,A,"Oh, well, see, I'm getting so many calls to Texas."
13023,B,"This is the very first one I've, I've talked to."
13024,A,"Oh, well, great."
13025,A,"Yeah,"
13026,A,I've been doing it for about two weeks
13027,A,"and, uh, no my, No my,"
13028,B,Uh-huh.
13029,A,So how do you get most of your current event information?
13030,B,"Well, , see I'm going to school right now,"
13031,B,"and, uh,  while I'm working, I don't get a, I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot,"
13032,A,Uh-huh.
13033,B,"and I don't watch T V as much really either, because, uh, my free time is kind of,"
13034,B,"and I do, like to do other stuff with it."
13035,A,Right.
13036,B,"While I'm at work sometimes, I, on the computer network um, I read the news sometimes,"
13037,A,Uh-huh.
13038,B,and that's kind of helpful.
13039,A,"I would imagine going to college, though, your professors and different things,"
13040,A,you keep up on what's going on.
13041,B,"That's true,"
13042,B,"I mean, my roommates and stuff, you know people around me talk about it."
13043,A,Yeah.
13044,B,"And the people I work with are pretty, you know, up, up-to-date on that kind of stuff,"
13045,B,so.
13046,A,Right.
13047,A,"Well, I'm a housewife,"
13048,A,"I have three kids,"
13049,A,"and so  um, I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then, um, talking with people and just hearing what's going on. ."
13050,B,Uh-huh.
13051,B,Yeah.
13052,B,"Do you watch, do you watch the network, like major network news,"
13053,B,or do you watch like  the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR?
13054,A,Just the regular channel  just channel eight.
13055,B,"Oh, really."
13056,A,That's our channel here
13057,A,"that's the, um, eyewitness news."
13058,B,Uh-huh.
13059,A,So.
13060,B,"Oh, see channel, where I am channel eight's, um, like public T V,"
13061,B,so it's kind of different.
13062,A,"Oh, uh-huh."
13063,A,Yeah.
13064,B,"I think, I think the, uh,"
13065,B,"I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on,"
13066,B,"but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news."
13067,A,Right.
13068,A,"And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not,"
13069,A,"and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name."
13070,B,Yeah.
13071,B,"Yeah,"
13072,B,exactly.
13073,A,I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.
13074,A,I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on.
13075,B,"Uh-huh,"
13076,B,"because they can, they can only report on, I mean,"
13077,B,"they give each candidate perhaps, you know, ten second blurbs in which to, you know, to say, you, you just can't get a full picture of, you know their message unless you have time to sit down and and probably read something on it."
13078,A,Right.
13079,A,Right.
13080,A,"And the news, too, it just doesn't, um, cover that many stories,"
13081,A,"I mean, it just covers your basic, you know, violent crimes and, you know, and, and your catastrophes with weather and stuff,"
13082,B,Yeah.
13083,A,"but other than that, you really don't know what's going on."
13084,B,Yeah.
13085,A,"Um, I will read our current letters that come out on elections"
13086,A,"and, I guess I do read that,"
13087,A,"and I do study who's running in our area,"
13088,A,and I do study what's going on in the economy.
13089,A,"It, you know,"
13090,A,"and, I guess I do read other magazines, um, too, to get my information."
13091,B,"What kind of, see,"
13092,B,"I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS,"
13093,B,"and that's, that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of, or like the updates, like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would, you know, bog me down that I wouldn't know about"
13094,A,Right.
13095,B,"but other than that I don't really read,"
13096,B,"I don't, I don't really subscribe to anything else."
13097,A,I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST
13098,B,Uh-huh.
13099,A,"but, um, now I guess I just have friends that clip articles"
13100,A,"or if I, you know, am interested in something, of course, during the when we were in war, I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on."
13101,B,"Oh, yeah."
13102,A,"But a lot of the times, I, you know, I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper,"
13103,A,but I just can't seem to find the time.
13104,B,Yeah.
13105,A,"If they put it out in a video, or on not a video but a cassette tape or something, where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things."
13106,B,Yeah.
13107,A,"But,"
13108,B,"Well, I remember back during the, uh, during the war, everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on, because that, they were going constantly with that stuff."
13109,A,Right.
13110,B,"But, uh."
13111,A,"Well, I, um, they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of,"
13112,A,and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news.
13113,A,"You know, we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas"
13114,B,Yeah.
13115,A,"that we want to hear what's going on with the economy, what's being done to help it, what's going on in other countries, what's, you know, just more information."
13116,B,"If they reported every, if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take, it would probably take the whole news hour"
13117,A,Yeah.
13118,B,"But, uh."
13119,A,"Well, I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the, uh, summer olympics"
13120,B,"Oh, yeah,"
13121,B,"that's,"
13122,B,"they start, already they're having like, um,"
13123,B,"in the newspaper they have a section, I think, every now and then, on the Olympics, you know,"
13124,B,"and they've got like a countdown,"
13125,B,it's like sixteen hundred days or something.
13126,A,"I know, we're trying to get tickets to it right now."
13127,B,"Oh, really?"
13128,A,Yeah.
13129,B,That's going to be crazy that time of year here.
13130,B,"But, uh."
13131,A,Yeah.
13132,B,"I can't believe, I mean,"
13133,B,"they're, they're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over,"
13134,B,I guess people want to hear about it.
13135,B,"Also big in the news right now is the Braves, because they're, uh, they're in, you know, spring training or whatever"
13136,A,"Right,"
13137,A,right.
13138,B,and they did so well last year.
13139,A,"Yeah,"
13140,A,"they spent a lot of time, that's another thing, they spend a long time on sports,"
13141,A,"and I think that, um, that's fine, I would like to see more time spent on other things."
13142,B,Yeah.
13143,A,But.
13144,B,"It seems like,"
13145,B,"I don't know,"
13146,B,"they way they do the newscasts, I wish they, they kind of separated it, you know,"
13147,B,if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it
13148,B,but I don't have cable.
13149,A,Dave.
13150,A,What kind of pets do you have?
13151,B,"Oh, we have one rotten cat."
13152,A,One rotten cat
13153,B,"Yeah,"
13154,B,it's my son's cat.
13155,A,I heard a laugh in the background.
13156,B,"Yeah,"
13157,B,that's the boys.
13158,B,They know I don't like it.
13159,A,Don't you like cats?
13160,B,"Well, I like cats."
13161,B,"This, this cat is a, uh, more like a dog."
13162,A,Oh yeah.
13163,B,Yeah
13164,B,"he's, uh, a one owner."
13165,B,He likes one boy in the family and that's about it
13166,A,That's odd.
13167,A,How does he treat the other people?
13168,B,"Just, uh, stays away or runs usually."
13169,A,Wow.
13170,B,"But he follows, he'll follow my oldest son around."
13171,B,"You know when he is in the house, he will come up and he'll jump on his lap,"
13172,B,"but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever, he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing."
13173,A,Did he raise him or something?
13174,B,"He's, he, we bought the cat for him"
13175,B,"and so he's, uh, been the one that you know spent the most time with him."
13176,B,"But I, I've never owned a cat like that."
13177,B,I've had cats growing up all the time
13178,B,and you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody
13179,A,Uh-huh.
13180,A,"Huh, that's interesting."
13181,B,"So, it's a weird cat"
13182,A,"Huh. We have a, a mutt."
13183,B,A mutt.
13184,A,"Well, we, we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from."
13185,B,Uh-huh.
13186,A,"Uh, some lady, she, uh,"
13187,A,"a lot of people, uh, uh, drop off abandoned, abandoned pets at her house"
13188,B,Oh.
13189,A,and she use to work for a veterinarian
13190,A,"so she would uh, neuter them give them all their shots"
13191,B,Uh-huh.
13192,A,"and we saw an ad saying it was free,"
13193,A,so we went down there and picked it up
13194,A,"and it's been an excellent dog,"
13195,A,but it's my first dog I've had
13196,A,and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone  while I go to work
13197,B,Uh-huh.
13198,A,so that's mostly why we got it. To keep her company while I am away at work.
13199,B,"So that, is that, is that kind of your child right now?"
13200,A,Uh yeah.
13201,A,"Right now it, it is."
13202,B,You feel like.
13203,A,It's kind of good training.
13204,A,"I mean we have been trying for kids,"
13205,A,"but right now we haven't had any,"
13206,B,"Oh, uh-huh."
13207,A,"but it's pretty good training, I think really, keeps her on her toes"
13208,B,"Have, have you had dogs before?"
13209,A,"Uh, my brother has."
13210,A,"Uh, we didn't do a lot with them."
13211,A,"Uh, I never felt like it was mine or anything,"
13212,A,you couldn't do anything.
13213,B,Uh-huh.
13214,A,"But, I mean, that did, did more responsibility. When its yours and not your brother's"
13215,B,Yeah.
13216,A,"But,"
13217,B,"Well, I just, uh, we've, you know"
13218,B,"when I was growing up I had, we always had a dog"
13219,B,"and we had mostly mutts,"
13220,B,"well not mutts, but mixes you know like one or two mix"
13221,A,Uh-huh.
13222,B,and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs.
13223,A,That's what we found.
13224,A,"Ours is, uh, like a cockapoo."
13225,B,Uh-huh.
13226,A,I think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle.
13227,B,Uh-huh.
13228,A,"But, it's a really good dog."
13229,B,Yeah.
13230,A,"I don't know,"
13231,A,"they seem to be, I mean, listen better or something."
13232,B,Uh-huh.
13233,A,Is your cat a purebred?
13234,B,No.
13235,B,"No,"
13236,B,it's just uh an accident
13237,B,"From a uh, from my, my son's friend down the street."
13238,B,They're their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens
13239,A,Uh-huh.
13240,B,"and so,"
13241,A,Would you ever want a dog in the family?
13242,B,"Uh, we, I would."
13243,B,"We, uh, we had a dog that was a, uh, mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador"
13244,A,Uh-huh.
13245,B,"and, uh, I should say a pup"
13246,B,and he was just too big for our kids when we got him
13247,A,Oh yeah.
13248,B,"and we, when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was, uh, you know, was a pet"
13249,B,and it was a dog that we gotten
13250,B,"and he was, he was just too big."
13251,A,Uh-huh.
13252,B,"Uh, the kids couldn't handle him"
13253,B,and I was still going to school
13254,B,and my wife was working
13255,B,and I was working
13256,B,and so we just didn't have time to really train him
13257,B,"so he was kind of you know, he was too big for the kids to handle,"
13258,B,so he was just tied up to a post
13259,A,"Oh, yeah."
13260,B,"so we gave him to, uh,"
13261,B,"I don't know if you've,"
13262,B,"there is a place out here, uh, called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville"
13263,A,Uh-huh.
13264,B,"and they have, uh,"
13265,B,I guess it's kind of an animal shelter
13266,B,but he just takes a few the animals in
13267,B,and some he destroys
13268,B,and some he keeps.
13269,A,Uh-huh.
13270,B,So we took him up there
13271,B,and he ended up keeping him.
13272,B,"Uh, cause he has had him for six or seven years."
13273,B,"We, we've, saw him just about a year ago"
13274,B,"and, uh, I thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away"
13275,A,Uh-huh.
13276,B,and so we asked him about it one day
13277,B,"and he said yeah,"
13278,B,he's been the best dog I've ever had in my life
13279,A,Wow.
13280,B,just goes everywhere with him.
13281,B,"I, he would have been a great, great dog."
13282,A,He just needed a lot of time.
13283,A,Uh-huh.
13284,B,Hey Steve.
13285,B,"Uh, They just, uh, they just started a recycling program here, I think."
13286,B,"Actually, this is my first experience with recycling program"
13287,B,"but, uh, instead of just like tossing everything away which I always felt bad about, uh, I am starting to split split stuff up."
13288,B,The only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb.
13289,B,They make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there.
13290,B,What are they doing up there?
13291,A,"Well, here in Saskatoon, uh, much the same thing."
13292,A,"There is no curb pick up of, uh, any of the recycled products."
13293,A,"Uh, we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people."
13294,A,"Uh, there are areas where we could, uh,"
13295,A,"actually we have a couple of the, uh, handicapped societies, types of places where the uh, one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers"
13296,A,"so, uh, we are able to, uh, have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing"
13297,A,"and then there are, there's a uh, deposit program on plastic and glass containers. Well, primarily soft drink bottles"
13298,A,"and so we are able uh to take it to one of the uh, rehabilitation centers"
13299,A,and then they recycle the containers.
13300,A,They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container
13301,A,"and then,"
13302,B,"The, the deposits only on like drink stuff."
13303,A,Right.
13304,B,Okay.
13305,A,"On the, on primarily on soft drink, pops and that kind of thing"
13306,B,Okay.
13307,A,"and, uh, so, they induce recycling of plastic and glass, soft drink containers."
13308,A,"Uh, we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well"
13309,B,"Oh, okay."
13310,A,"and actually the recycler, there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler, uh, with the handicapped group will also accept those."
13311,A,"So, uh, it's fairly, fairly extensive,"
13312,A,"but then again it's uh, it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city."
13313,B,"So, did they,"
13314,B,"you're giving, are you giving these products to the handicapped group"
13315,B,"and the handicapped group is getting the uh, the money"
13316,B,"or or are you, or are they some home distributing the funds back to you."
13317,A,"Well, actually there's, there's the opportunity for both."
13318,B,Oh. Okay.
13319,A,"Generally the, uh, the handicapped group takes care of the things that"
13320,A,"actually, the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to recycle the bottle so that you get your money back"
13321,A,and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit
13322,A,"and then I, and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well"
13323,B,That's very cool.
13324,B,"You know there's a, I heard about a similar program in New York City where, uh, a thing called like Homeless Incorporated or something like that,"
13325,B,"but what they do is employ, uh, homeless, I think mostly men, but homeless people to uh, go out and collect all the recyclable cans"
13326,B,and and I think it's mostly cans.
13327,B,"There may be bottles as well, but like beer cans, soda cans and what not"
13328,B,"and they, uh, bring them up to a one one centralized location and, uh, are able to collect the money from the various beer and, and soda manufacturers and, uh, and get more money to these people that desperately need it."
13329,A,Oh yeah.
13330,A,"Uh, I guess partly because of our climate."
13331,A,"Here in Saskatoon at least, the majority of central, uh,"
13332,A,"well, I want to say Central Canada,"
13333,A,but Central Canada tends to referred more to Ontario and Quebec
13334,B,Yeah.
13335,A,"but, uh, we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people."
13336,A,We certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing.
13337,A,"Uh, there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although, uh, scouts and hockey teams and ball teams, those kinds, uh, regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes."
13338,B,Do they do it with news papers as well?
13339,A,"They have done it some, uh,"
13340,A,but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers.
13341,A,"They are actually at, virtually all of the shopping centers. Like the shopping malls."
13342,A,There are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects
13343,A,or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins
13344,A,and then the bins are collected.
13345,B,Huh.
13346,A,"Uh, some of the,"
13347,A,"Jimmy , so how do you get most of your news?"
13348,B,"Well, I kind of, uh, I watch the, uh, national news every day, for one."
13349,B,I also read one or two papers a day
13350,B,"and I'm a, I'm pretty much a news junkie"
13351,B,and I tune in to C N N a lot.
13352,A,"Oh, wow."
13353,A,"So, when you say the morning news, or evening news or national news is when?"
13354,B,"Uh, every evening at six thirty, I believe,"
13355,B,I watch the national news.
13356,A,"Oh, okay."
13357,A,"Well, I would probably be a junkie or watch C N N a lot,"
13358,A,"but I don't, uh, I don't, uh, subscribe to cable because of the poor service and also, uh, because,"
13359,B,Uh-huh.
13360,A,"well, I, uh, I give to the United Way"
13361,A,and so I figured that amount of money I just donate to that.
13362,B,"Uh-huh,"
13363,B,as opposed to paying for cable.
13364,A,"Yeah,"
13365,A,"I take away a, uh, addiction"
13366,A,"Oh, something."
13367,B,Yeah.
13368,A,"Well I,"
13369,B,"Uh, overall I, I,"
13370,B,"the quality of the news you get off of most, uh, sources I would say is pretty low."
13371,B,"It's,"
13372,B,usually you get pretty incomplete coverage
13373,B,"and that's one of the reasons where I, why I try and get as many sources as possible,"
13374,B,"because if you hear the same story from three different sources, then you get a much clearer picture of, of what is going on. You would hope,"
13375,B,"but still, you know, hard to say that what you've heard is what really is."
13376,A,Oh.
13377,A,"What, what, uh, newspapers do you read?"
13378,B,"Well, I read, uh, the local newspaper"
13379,B,"and I also try and read one of the, uh, major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE, or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that."
13380,A,Uh-huh.
13381,A,"For a while there I, I, I, uh, subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES, actually a couple of newspapers because, uh, you know, my fiance,"
13382,A,"well, she was unemployed for a while"
13383,A,"so she, you know, really needed to look at the, the help wanted ads"
13384,B,Uh-huh.
13385,A,"and so often they, they the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of uh, news."
13386,B,Right.
13387,A,"And, I don't know,"
13388,A,"NEW YORK TIMES is okay,"
13389,A,"but, uh, and when you read a lot of this stuff, the, the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so,"
13390,A,"but uh, I mean, they, they say it's like the sixth grade reading level,"
13391,B,Uh-huh.
13392,A,"but I swear it's at least second or third grade, sometimes."
13393,B,Right.
13394,B,Pretty low.
13395,A,"But, I don't know,"
13396,A,"uh, I think if you listen to like N P R or something like,"
13397,B,"Right,"
13398,B,"I, I really like N P R a lot."
13399,A,That's pretty good.
13400,A,"Uh, and I like listening to that on, on, uh,"
13401,A,"when I get a chance, when I'm in the car a long enough time to, to listen to it, because I,"
13402,B,"Right,"
13403,B,"yeah,"
13404,B,I miss N P R a lot also.
13405,B,"I really like them because they give, uh,"
13406,B,"instead of being, as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb, they go really in depth on topics which I think is good."
13407,A,"Uh,"
13408,B,"And they also,"
13409,B,"their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than, say, your major network news and that kind of thing."
13410,A,"Well, McNeil and Lehrer,"
13411,A,"I guess he's leaving,"
13412,A,one of them is leaving.
13413,B,Uh-huh.
13414,A,"Uh, they're, they're pretty good, too."
13415,A,"Uh, I guess a year ago you're probably watching C N N a lot, right?"
13416,B,Right
13417,B,yeah.
13418,A,Had that invasion or whatever it is.
13419,B,Sure was.
13420,A,"Uh, but I, I don't know,"
13421,A,I guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype.
13422,A,"Look at the, the Smith trial."
13423,B,Uh-huh.
13424,A,"I mean, that was a joke."
13425,B,"Yeah,"
13426,B,"that was,"
13427,B,"but then you also have things where you, uh, where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was really good."
13428,A,"Oh, yeah,"
13429,A,"the N P R doing that,"
13430,A,"yeah,"
13431,A,"I know,"
13432,A,"I had, uh, some visitor"
13433,A,"and he was just just, I don't know, fixated on that, you know, just listened to it constantly."
13434,B,Uh-uh.
13435,A,"Uh, and I guess that's good when it's live, if you, if you'll really want that,"
13436,A,but that's not really providing you news.
13437,B,Right.
13438,A,"It's, it's more like a media event rather than reporting."
13439,B,"Well, but the but the news, news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event, which is something that's good also about C Span which I, I tune into every once in a while."
13440,A,"Oh, really?"
13441,A,"That's kind of boring to me, I think."
13442,B,"Yeah,"
13443,B,"it, it is, really kind of boring,"
13444,B,"but, you know, that's,"
13445,B,"if, if you don't watch it there, then you're going to hear somebody else's canned, uh, report, somebody else's view about it"
13446,B,"and that's what you're supposed, you're supposed to,"
13447,B,"if you watch the news, you're going, your opinion is going to be formed about, on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own pinion, opinion, which I haven't, would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's."
13448,A,Yeah.
13449,A,"Yeah,"
13450,A,I guess that's true.
13451,A,"But, one of the ways that I get information is, uh, every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this, this thing,"
13452,A,"it's free inside the company,"
13453,A,it's called INTELLECT
13454,A,"and, and they basically, uh, type out abstracts which are really literally,"
13455,A,"I've, I've actually read the actual articles,"
13456,A,they're pretty
13457,A,"Let's see,"
13458,A,mine's pretty easy actually.
13459,A,"Uh, I just got done reading a, a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the, uh, new Saturns."
13460,B,Uh-huh.
13461,A,"Uh, and, although I can't afford it right now, I would just like love to have one."
13462,B,"Oh, really,"
13463,B,"you like, uh,"
13464,B,so you're an American
13465,A,"Well,"
13466,B,you want to buy American.
13467,A,"No,"
13468,A,regardless of that fact.
13469,A,It's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money.
13470,A,"I'm interested in having it for, uh, doing a little autocross racing, uh, closed circuit racing"
13471,B,Um.
13472,A,"and, uh, it seems to just blow the competition away."
13473,B,"It terms of handling, uh, acceleration,"
13474,A,"Handling, power, everything."
13475,A,"Yeah,"
13476,A,it just got like the top rating.
13477,A,"It was compared up against, uh,"
13478,A,"let's see,"
13479,A,"there was like the Mazda M X three, uh, Nissan's, whatever, their two, N X two thousand, the Civic S I"
13480,A,"and it just, you know, it, it dominated over all of them."
13481,A,"Everybody, all the, uh, raters loved it."
13482,A,"I like the, I like the styling"
13483,A,"and, I seen a few of them actually race"
13484,A,and they seem to be really good cars for it.
13485,B,What about Mustang G T
13486,A,Mustang G T
13487,A,"Uh, can't afford it."
13488,B,"Those,"
13489,B,"so you're talking about ones in a lower, lower end, price range."
13490,A,"Right,"
13491,A,"yeah,"
13492,A,I'm a graduate student
13493,A,"and, let's face it,"
13494,A,I don't make any money
13495,A,"so,"
13496,B,Right.
13497,B,"Well, you can wait till you graduate"
13498,B,"and you'll have plenty of money,"
13499,B,you can buy whatever you want.
13500,A,Yeah.
13501,A,"Yeah,"
13502,A,we'll see then.
13503,A,"Yeah,"
13504,A,"right now I'm stuck,"
13505,A,"I, I've got a, a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that,"
13506,A,"it's fast, but unreliable"
13507,A,and trying to get it prepared for racing.
13508,A,"But it's, it would be nice, just like scrap it and go for the Saturn."
13509,B,"Right,"
13510,B,would you use that for city driving and racing?
13511,A,"Oh, yeah,"
13512,A,"I'd do it, I'd use it for both."
13513,A,"The nice thing about autocrossing is you can, you can do both."
13514,B,"Autocrossing is,"
13515,B,what kind of track is that?
13516,A,"Uh, just like a, uh, set up a lot of times"
13517,A,"and it's like really large, uh, parking lots. And pylons and things."
13518,B,Okay.
13519,B,"And you put up, set up the track, pylons."
13520,B,Okay.
13521,A,"Tight turns, hard acceleration."
13522,A,"I've seen a lot of Mustangs, uh, compete"
13523,A,and it's interesting.
13524,A,They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class.
13525,B,"Oh, really?"
13526,A,Yeah.
13527,B,"Yeah,"
13528,B,I would guess so.
13529,A,"Uh, what are you thinking about buying?"
13530,B,"Uh, I think I'd like to get, uh, B M W or if I go the German route, which I'm kind of leaning towards right now, but, uh, or maybe a, I mean, a, a Acura Legend. Uh"
13531,A,The Legend.
13532,A,Uh.
13533,B,"a Lexus, uh, S C three hundred maybe. Something on that order."
13534,A,Uh-huh.
13535,A,Yeah.
13536,B,"You know, because your B M W your German cars have good reputations, I think."
13537,A,"Yeah,"
13538,A,"well, I was, I was actually in, uh,"
13539,A,"a lot of the B M W are produced in, uh, uh, Stutgardt and, uh, and Munich"
13540,B,Yes.
13541,A,"and I was, I was there this, uh, summer"
13542,A,"and, uh, I was really impressed by the, uh, the, uh, factory, uh, tours and such for B M W."
13543,B,"The,"
13544,B,"Yeah,"
13545,B,"they, their, they have the whole philosophy,"
13546,B,"I mean, they, they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better, which is kind of hard to take"
13547,A,Yeah.
13548,B,"I mean as you're walking through that little tour in, uh, Munich, it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you, too"
13549,A,"Uh,"
13550,A,"Oh, of course,"
13551,A,of course they are.
13552,A,They want you to buy their car.
13553,A,"Yeah,"
13554,A,"there,"
13555,A,"it was, it was interesting."
13556,A,"I was at, I, I also went to, uh, the Porsche"
13557,A,"and, uh, it was, it was amazing how they were completely opposed."
13558,B,"Oh, really?"
13559,A,"Yeah,"
13560,A,"the, uh, the B M W is really, oh, like, oh, we have all these like high tech things"
13561,A,and everything is put together with exacting tolerances
13562,A,"and, and then you go to Porsche"
13563,A,"and it's like, well, uh, these cars are completely handmade"
13564,B,Um.
13565,A,and no two of them are alike
13566,A,And
13567,B,Yeah
13568,B,"that's,"
13569,A,so it's like completely opposed.
13570,A,"I don't know,"
13571,A,"which do I like better,"
13572,A,"I think I like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better, although it's not really practical."
13573,B,"No,"
13574,B,it's not realistic.
13575,A,"Unless, it's, it's a toy."
13576,B,"Yeah,"
13577,B,"if you can afford that kind of a toy, then, I guess, uh"
13578,A,Let's face it.
13579,A,"Yeah,"
13580,A,"yeah,"
13581,A,"but it, it, B M W good for that."
13582,A,"What kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it, use it for?"
13583,B,"Yeah,"
13584,B,"just work,"
13585,B,short trips.
13586,B,No no heavy mileage.
13587,B,I'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year.
13588,A,"Wow, yeah."
13589,B,So it's pretty minimal.
13590,A,That's cool.
13591,B,Lasts a long time.
13592,B,That's mainly what I'm looking for.
13593,A,"Yeah,"
13594,A,that's good.
13595,A,"I also, I was impressed by, uh, by the Mercedes, too."
13596,B,"Oh, yeah."
13597,A,"I really, I really like the Mercedes."
13598,B,"But, But if, if you have a problem with a Mercedes, you take it into a shop, they're going to, they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things"
13599,A,The factory was nice
13600,A,"and,"
13601,A,"And is it different for the, for the B M W?"
13602,B,"Uh, I think, well, something on the order of a three series, it's probably different."
13603,B,"Once you get up in the five series and higher, then, all your repair costs go up significantly"
13604,A,Probably.
13605,A,"Right,"
13606,A,I can imagine that.
13607,B,"So I'm kind,"
13608,B,"yeah,"
13609,B,"I'm not sure if I really want,"
13610,A,All right?
13611,B,Yes.
13612,A,Okay.
13613,A,How many kids do you have?
13614,B,I think I think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children.
13615,B,"We,  have three children who are eleven, nine, and eight."
13616,A,Right.
13617,B,So this is the big issue with us. Although I don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about
13618,B,but perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time
13619,B,"and,"
13620,A,Uh-huh.
13621,B,Anyway.
13622,B,You don't have children?
13623,A,No.
13624,B,But you're married?
13625,A,"Yeah,"
13626,A,"we, we've been married for two and a half years."
13627,A,We've been trying for about two years but no luck yet.
13628,B,Oh.
13629,A,"Hopefully,"
13630,B,"You know, I know we're not supposed to do this long distance"
13631,B,but actually I'm getting a call.
13632,B,I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting.
13633,B,Could I ask you to hold one minute?
13634,A,Uh-huh.
13635,B,I'll be right back.
13636,B,"Excuse me,  just a moment."
13637,B,They're going to get mad
13638,A,whispers to someone in the She had another call.
13639,A,"She has just three kids, eleven, nine, and eight."
13640,B,Hello?
13641,A,Uh-huh.
13642,B,I'm so sorry.
13643,A,All right.
13644,B,That was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting.
13645,A,Okay.
13646,A,That keeps you
13647,A,do you have a lot of activities with your kids?
13648,B,"Well, I don't want to, I don't want this to be a unilateral conversation"
13649,B,"but, yes,"
13650,B,we do.
13651,B,Both my husband and I work
13652,B,"and our children are sixth, fourth, and third grade."
13653,B,"And the school years are wonderful,"
13654,B,they're just wonderful.
13655,A,Uh-huh.
13656,B,"The kids, they are real people"
13657,B,and they are interesting
13658,B,"and, they, they have all their own activities"
13659,B,"and, um, I think as parents we really enjoy them in, in our personal situation"
13660,B,our children have not yet decided to rebel
13661,A,Uh-huh.
13662,A,"So they're pretty good kids, huh?"
13663,B,I'm sure that's coming though.
13664,B,"But,  they are wonderful kids."
13665,A,Yeah.
13666,A,"Well, we had growing up"
13667,A,I guess I can talk about us.
13668,A,We had nine kids in our family.
13669,A,We had eight boys and one girl.
13670,A,"But, my Dad, uh,"
13671,B,You had eight boys and one girl?
13672,A,Yeah.
13673,A,"And the time that my, we spent with our Dad was, he owned his own business"
13674,A,so we worked with him most of the time.
13675,A,So that's how we spent most of the time with him.
13676,B,Are you Mormons?
13677,A,Yeah.
13678,B,That's what the Utah and the large family.
13679,A,"That was a dead giveaway, huh?"
13680,B,"Well, we're Catholics."
13681,B,I came from a family of five.
13682,B,"I had four brothers,"
13683,A,Uh-huh.
13684,B,the only girl.
13685,A,Oh.
13686,B,And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled.
13687,A,"Which that,"
13688,B,I never felt spoiled.
13689,B,In fact I always thought my toys were destroyed
13690,A,"I was going to say, my sister wasn't spoiled very much."
13691,B,No.
13692,B,Usually busy fighting for survival.
13693,A,"Yeah,"
13694,A,that's .
13695,A,"But,"
13696,B,"Well, I do think with working parents it is, I mean, there are some real issues here. Um,  that I think, um,"
13697,A,Uh-huh.
13698,B,I don't know.
13699,B,It's an interesting problem.
13700,B,"I happen to, um,"
13701,B,I'm a pediatrician.
13702,A,Oh.
13703,B,"My husband is a physician,"
13704,B,"so, uh, I, I I talk to parents about this a lot."
13705,B,"But children,"
13706,B,"I, I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home, um, need very early to come to grips with any guilt,  that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family."
13707,A,Yeah.
13708,A,Uh-huh.
13709,B,"And I feel when my children were very young, I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing."
13710,B,And I long ago decided I'm a better mother because I work outside the home.
13711,A,Uh-huh.
13712,B,I really believe that.
13713,B,"And it has, um, helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that I think are wonderful particularly at this age,"
13714,B,and I think our kids are real secure. And have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot
13715,A,Uh-huh.
13716,B,so I know it sounds like a rationalization
13717,B,"but it's, I really think it's true for our family,"
13718,B,and I think it has worked very well.
13719,A,Yeah.
13720,A,"It's like you said, you know, to each his own."
13721,A,And we're planning on having my wife stay home.
13722,A,"And but,"
13723,B,"There's no question,"
13724,B,I think that's really the best.
13725,B,"If, if a woman is happy doing that,"
13726,A,Uh-huh.
13727,B,I hate to put it quite that way.
13728,A,Yeah.
13729,B,I was twenty-nine when I had my first child
13730,B,"and, uh, I would not have been real fulfilled."
13731,B,I really would not have been totally staying home with a young child.
13732,A,Uh-huh.
13733,B,"It's a wonderful, it's wonderful to be a mother"
13734,B,"but, uh, I like I like the way I did it."
13735,A,Right.
13736,B,I sort of worked half time.
13737,B,I had very flexible hours.
13738,B,I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year
13739,B,"and I,  you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I preach all the time to, to mothers."
13740,A,Oh.
13741,A,Uh-huh.
13742,B,"Um, and I think we choose very, very carefully the, um, alternative situations that we had them in."
13743,A,Uh-huh.
13744,B,"Some baby-sitting groups,"
13745,B,"again, I know it sounds like a rationalization,"
13746,B,but I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children
13747,B,"and they, they learn to share."
13748,B,They learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure.
13749,A,Uh-huh.
13750,B,I think that helps.
13751,A,"Well, that's good."
13752,A,"Sounds like you're, have a handle on it."
13753,B,"Well, so, so . So, your wife, does she work right now?"
13754,A,"Um, no,"
13755,A,not right now.
13756,B,"She's out,"
13757,A,Right.
13758,A,"Well, we just moved down here."
13759,A,We used to live up in Seattle for a couple of years.
13760,B,You're still trying to dry out?
13761,A,It's that's no problem here.
13762,A,"Yeah,"
13763,A,we really liked it up there
13764,A,but then
13765,A,"I don't believe that we're ,"
13766,B,"So what do you think about, uh, recycling programs in Atlanta, Julie?"
13767,A,The recycling program here is just terrible.
13768,A,I mean it's hard to find places to go.
13769,A,"I mean, Kroger does a couple things."
13770,A,"They, I don't think they, do they do newspapers?"
13771,B,"I don't know,"
13772,B,"there's, there's big bins out there,"
13773,B,I don't know if they ever get
13774,B,"I, I really don't know what the details are."
13775,B,There should be someplace where you could call and find out.
13776,B,"As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest, you know, thing to you,"
13777,B,"but, I think there should be some kind of curbside service."
13778,A,Yeah.
13779,B,"That's the only way I could really,"
13780,A,The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything.
13781,A,"They pick up newspapers and, uh, you know, milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans, you know, like soup comes in and stuff."
13782,B,Uh-huh.
13783,A,They pick up everything.
13784,B,"During the summers, like the, around where I live the, uh, homeless people"
13785,B,"I mean, they all have like shopping carts and stuff"
13786,A,Uh-huh.
13787,B,"and they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff,"
13788,A,Uh-huh.
13789,B,and so we used to just save them up
13790,B,and then they'd come around
13791,B,and we'd give them to them.
13792,A,Uh-huh.
13793,B,"But, when,"
13794,B,"during the winter time I think they, they move south or something"
13795,A,Yeah
13796,B,"so, I don't do that anymore."
13797,B,"And the, the recycling at Georgia Tech, like that, uh, outside the, uh, student center they never empty those things."
13798,A,Uh-huh.
13799,A,"I know it,"
13800,A,I know it.
13801,B,They just overflow.
13802,A,It piles up.
13803,B,So what's a guy to do?
13804,A,I just don't know.
13805,B,I asked myself.
13806,A,I just don't know
13807,A,"and now they have, like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because, mean, until seven o'clock, you got to pay to park at the student center,"
13808,A,you can't really unload all your stuff.
13809,B,Really?
13810,B,"Huh, oh, yeah,"
13811,B,"that's true,"
13812,B,hadn't thought about that.
13813,B,That is very inconvenient.
13814,A,Uh-huh.
13815,B,"Inconvenient, even"
13816,A,"I know it,"
13817,A,I know it.
13818,B,"But, uh,"
13819,B,"so, you do recycle, don't you?"
13820,A,"Oh, yeah."
13821,B,"Yeah,"
13822,B,"I'm kind of, I'm kind of bad about it."
13823,A,"The ,"
13824,B,"If I, if see a, if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I'll throw it in there"
13825,A,Uh-huh.
13826,B,"but I don't really, I don't ever take anything."
13827,A,"Well, I mean, it's real,"
13828,A,"you ought to, because the, the, the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything."
13829,B,Uh-huh.
13830,A,"And since we go there all the time, I mean"
13831,B,But wait
13832,A,probably at all.
13833,B,I've never seen you before
13834,B,Who are you?
13835,A,"Oh, by the way, may name's Julie."
13836,B,"Yeah,"
13837,B,my name's Bill.
13838,B,"Well,"
13839,A,Hi.
13840,B,Hi.
13841,A,I'm from Atlanta.
13842,B,"Me, too."
13843,A,Neat.
13844,B,Crazy.
13845,B,"Uh, well, is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy, Julie?"
13846,A,I just think that everybody ought to do it.
13847,B,Do they do
13848,B,"like, what about, like, uh,"
13849,B,"what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle, do you know?"
13850,A,The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs.
13851,B,Really?
13852,A,Yeah.
13853,B,What about like those grocery bags?
13854,A,"Oh, yeah,"
13855,A,"they have, uh,"
13856,A,"uh, what I, what I used to, uh,"
13857,A,"now that I don't go to the grocery store much, it's kind of moot,"
13858,A,but I used to just save up the ones that I got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over.
13859,B,Uh-huh.
13860,B,Uh-huh.
13861,A,"but, also most places, like Big Star does"
13862,A,and I'm not sure if Kroger does or not
13863,A,"but,"
13864,B,They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic.
13865,A,"Yeah,"
13866,A,"and they, they have like little, little boxes that you can put your old bags in."
13867,B,uh.
13868,A,Can bring them in.
13869,B,Those petroleum products are going to kill us.
13870,A,"I know it,"
13871,A,I know it.
13872,B,"The hostile planet, I think, Julie."
13873,A,"It really is a small,  hostile planet"
13874,B,"The petroleum pretty much, I mean, those petroleum products I think are the big, uh, you know the great Satan of the recycling."
13875,A,"Did you know that,"
13876,A,"No,"
13877,A,really not.
13878,A,"Did you know that, like, something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper? Filled with paper."
13879,B,Um.
13880,B,Paper just seems so innocuous.
13881,A,Huh?
13882,B,"Paper doesn't seem threatening at all, you know."
13883,A,"Well, it is, it is, though."
13884,B,It comes from trees.
13885,B,How can it be bad?
13886,A,"It is, because they,"
13887,B,They treat it with chemicals or something?
13888,B,Why can't trees break down?
13889,B,I don't get it.
13890,A,"Well, they do treat paper with chemicals"
13891,A,"like yellow paper, you know takes something like twenty times as long to decompose."
13892,B,Yep.
13893,B,Oh
13894,A,"You know, you can bury a piece of yellow paper,"
13895,A,it will still be there in a couple of weeks.
13896,B,Really?
13897,A,Yeah
13898,B,Huh.
13899,A,it will be whole.
13900,A,You'll be able to read  off of it.
13901,B,"I'm going to switch  from those yellow legal pads, then."
13902,A,"Yeah, um."
13903,B,"I'm glad you told me that, because I use those at work, where I work"
13904,B,"and, uh, But I can just forget that from now on."
13905,B,I'm going I'm going to switch to the white ones.
13906,A,"Well, white paper's bad too."
13907,A,"They, they treat it, too."
13908,B,"Well, what about, uh, papyrus, you know, made out of you know, bamboo stuff, from the from the  banks of the Nile."
13909,A,I'm sure that's fine.
13910,A,I'm sure.
13911,A,Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again.
13912,B,You think so?
13913,A,Maybe.
13914,B,Tablets?
13915,A,Yeah.
13916,B,"I think we should just abandon the, you know, the written word altogether, you know."
13917,A,You think?
13918,A,"I don't know,"
13919,A,"well, I mean, I think we've kind of, you know,"
13920,B,What do you think?
13921,A,"I mean, everybody, everybody everybody has a computer."
13922,B,"Kind of radical, I know"
13923,B,"but,"
13924,A,We would no longer need paper at all.
13925,B,That's true.
13926,B,"Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V on their wrist, like, uh, Dick Tracy."
13927,A,I would love that.
13928,A,"So how do you, uh,"
13929,A,"so, so, it sounds like you've got a television going on there,"
13930,A,so I can assume that you probably watch the T V news.
13931,A,"Is that,"
13932,B,I almost never watch T V news.
13933,A,Really?
13934,A,Wow.
13935,A,"I ,"
13936,B,I get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio.
13937,A,"Uh, what, what station do you listen to?"
13938,B,"Uh, it's a local radio station."
13939,B,"It's called, uh, K L I F, cliff."
13940,A,"Cliff, I see,"
13941,A,"so, uh, it's not affiliated with anything, is it."
13942,A,Not it's not a network station.
13943,B,No.
13944,B,No.
13945,A,"Okay,"
13946,A,"yeah,"
13947,A,"because I, I listen to, uh, public radio a lot"
13948,A,"and they have, they have K C R W, which I, I, I saw a thing recently, they may be trying to start their own, uh, cable TV outlet, I guess."
13949,A,"They're getting a little, getting a little feisty now"
13950,B,"Well, this has, this station has a lot of just ongoing news"
13951,A,"Uh,"
13952,B,"and occasionally in the morning, I'll pick up something like, uh, C N N or that,"
13953,B,"but I hate watching the, like, ten o'clock news"
13954,B,"or,"
13955,A,"Yeah,"
13956,A,"so you have a paper or something or,"
13957,B,"Yeah,"
13958,B,"we have a well, we have, uh, DALLAS MORNING NEWS which is the big paper in Dallas."
13959,A,Uh-huh.
13960,B,"We read, I read it pretty much from cover to cover."
13961,A,Yeah.
13962,A,How do you like it?
13963,A,"It's been, it's been a while since I read the Dallas news."
13964,A,"I, uh, fact, last time I read the Dallas, Dallas news I was in Arkansas."
13965,A,"I, uh ,"
13966,B,The TIMES HERALD went out of business here
13967,A,"Oh, yeah?"
13968,B,"and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one, Fort Worth newspaper."
13969,A,"Well, that must be pretty bad."
13970,A,"So, how did that happen, anyway?"
13971,B,"Uh, financial trouble."
13972,A,"No,"
13973,A,"not how,"
13974,A,"I mean, when did it, when did they ,"
13975,B,"Oh, when did it happen?"
13976,A,Yeah.
13977,B,I guess they closed down about three months ago.
13978,A,"Oh, really."
13979,A,Um.
13980,B,"So, how do you keep up?"
13981,A,"Oh, me, I, uh, good grief, I read the TIMES, LOS ANGELES TIMES."
13982,A,"There's, quite a task if you've ever run into one."
13983,A,"They're, uh"
13984,B,"Yes, they're very voluminous."
13985,A,"Yeah,"
13986,A,they're thick.
13987,A,"Uh, if there's something you want to know, it's, it's in the TIMES and then, and in detail. *repair bracketing wrong"
13988,A,"Uh, they, uh, we, we used to have two papers here in town"
13989,A,"and then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of, oh, I don't know, just nobody was buying it really."
13990,B,So there really is only one major L A now?
13991,A,"Yeah,"
13992,A,pretty much.
13993,A,"Uh, there used to be, fact, I think there still is, the, uh, the DAILY NEWS which runs out of the San Fernando Valley"
13994,A,"and, uh, they're not bad as far as a, uh, you know, as far as a local paper goes."
13995,A,"In fact, it was kind of weird, because I met the, uh, I met the, I met the editor, uh, while I was on, uh, while I was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time"
13996,A,It was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff.
13997,A,"He was a really cool guy. Uh, you know, went to Columbia University and all this stuff."
13998,A,"And, uh it's, it's a pretty good paper,"
13999,A,"but, uh, you know, it's not, it's not the TIMES."
14000,B,Yeah.
14001,A,"Although I, you know, I'm sorry to see some of their, uh,"
14002,A,"there's, there's a daily news, uh, news rack right around the corner from where I live, which means that they're, they're expanding, I guess."
14003,A,"But, uh, and occasionally I, I pick up like TIME magazine or something I think, uh, if they've got an interesting lead story,"
14004,A,"but you know, it's,"
14005,A,"I, I don't have time."
14006,B,"I used to read TIME magazine a lot,"
14007,B,but I don't read it much anymore.
14008,A,"Yeah,"
14009,A,"that's, that's kind of a problem for them."
14010,A,"There's a lot of people who fall into that, category."
14011,B,And then we have a local rag here in town that I pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community. Because we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the DALLAS MORNING NEWS.
14012,A,Uh-huh.
14013,A,I see.
14014,A,"Yeah,"
14015,A,"the big dailies don't like to, don't like to step much out of their, uh, out of their home turf,"
14016,A,"I have to admit, the TIMES is kind of provincial, too."
14017,A,"It's basically anything that's south of downtown, they don't bother to cover."
14018,B,"Now, they have started here running a three day, or three times a week Plano section."
14019,A,Uh-huh.
14020,B,"And it's just sort of a, you know, four or five pages that covers what's going on in Plano."
14021,B,But it's still not an awful lot of news.
14022,A,"Yeah,"
14023,A,I know.
14024,A,"I, uh, it was, it was a big discovery when, when the TIMES, when the TIMES found out there was a place called Orange County"
14025,A,"I mean, the way they, I mean, the way they've been handling it before, they practically, they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the L A county border"
14026,B,"Oh, I would imagine in, uh, you know, in, in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover, that it gets hard covering all of the suburbs"
14027,B,"and, of course, they tend to cover the county,"
14028,B,"and we're not in Dallas county,"
14029,B,so they tend to ignore places outside of the county.
14030,A,"Oh, really?"
14031,A,"Yeah,"
14032,A,"yeah,"
14033,A,"I, I, I find that attitude kind of arrogant, though."
14034,A,"It's like you're taking our money,"
14035,A,but you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us.
14036,B,Yeah.
14037,B,Okay.
14038,B,"Well, uh, I'll let you start, I guess"
14039,A,"Well, uh, yeah,"
14040,A,"I, I'm employed by a company that does do, uh, random drug testing"
14041,A,"and I've got some very definite, uh, opinions about it. Uh, you know, which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from, from when they, when they announced it. But, uh, developed a little more, I guess, but haven't changed that much."
14042,A,What about you?
14043,A,"Are you, uh, involved at all?"
14044,B,"Uh, no."
14045,B,"I mean, I'm not,"
14046,B,"my employer does not do that. Uh, although, uh, I had an ex-employer that,"
14047,B,"uh, the previous job I used to have, uh, they,"
14048,B,"after, I guess a few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test."
14049,A,Yes.
14050,B,"Uh, I, I don't know."
14051,B,"My feeling is that certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb, uh, if should somebody be under the influence of drugs, I, I'd be willing to support that."
14052,B,"For example, uh, uh, well, uh, uh, train engineers."
14053,A,Yeah.
14054,B,"Because it, you know, uh, like, there was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer you know"
14055,A,Right.
14056,B,"he crashed and killed some people because he was, uh, smoking some marijuana"
14057,B,and I guess air traffic controllers. I wouldn't want them to be on drugs. And airplane pilots.
14058,B,"But where it's not necessary, uh, in that regard, where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property uh, I, I'd, I would seriously question it."
14059,A,Yeah.
14060,B,"Uh, so."
14061,A,Yeah.
14062,A,Yeah.
14063,A,"It, uh, that's, that's mine."
14064,A,"It, it, you know,"
14065,A,"I, I go back,"
14066,A,"it, to me, no matter how much the, our company claims it's not a constitutional issue. That, because this is, uh, between a company and an employee it is not, it is not a government,"
14067,A,"it's not,"
14068,A,the Constitution doesn't apply.
14069,A,"But I it, it seems to me that it still should."
14070,A,"I, I, our company's doing it because they're a, uh, government contractor"
14071,A,"Uh, and so it's, it's required for certain, some form, some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts"
14072,B,So it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent?
14073,A,Okay.
14074,A,and our company has taken that and gone all the way.
14075,A,"Say,"
14076,A,"okay, uh,"
14077,A,"first off we don't, we don't have enough courage to, uh, pick out the people that, that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage, uh, because that would offend them, uh, if they, if they weren't."
14078,A,"So we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and, make it all even."
14079,A,"Uh, and  and, uh"
14080,B,Yeah.
14081,B,"Well,"
14082,A,"then, uh,"
14083,A,"but and they,"
14084,A,"so it's, a, a complete random testing"
14085,A,well it's random in the sense that you don't know when.
14086,A,It is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested.
14087,B,Huh.
14088,A,"Uh, and, uh, you know, I, I sit at a terminal and, and write software all day."
14089,A,"It, it, uh, certainly has no life threatening, uh, capabilities uh, you know, in, in my job."
14090,B,Right.
14091,B,"And,"
14092,A,"And, and, uh, yes"
14093,A,"I, I agree that there are, there are, uh, jobs that are definitely life threatening"
14094,A,"and, and, and there needs to be a line drawn somewhere at, reasonable and proper."
14095,A,"you know,"
14096,B,"Yeah,"
14097,B,yeah.
14098,B,I agree.
14099,B,"I mean it's, well there's also the issue of, uh,"
14100,B,"out here, I remember hearing a year or so ago, that, uh, a lot of,"
14101,B,there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results.
14102,B,"or, I shouldn't say high"
14103,A,"Well,"
14104,B,I mean several percent
14105,A,Yeah.
14106,A,"I, that, that I, that I will give credit to, to our, our company for in that, that, I think there's, there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of, of, uh, of drugs."
14107,A,"And essentially the first thing is is on the order of paper in the urine and, uh, or some, you know,"
14108,A,"it's not quite that simple,"
14109,A,but it's fairly simple.
14110,B,Kind of a coarse kind of test.
14111,A,Coarse kind of test.
14112,A,"And then there's a, a much more, uh, uh, refined test, uh, uh, spectrography or whatever it's called. The  chemotography uh, to determine exactly what the, what the things are."
14113,B,"Is that done,"
14114,B,Right.
14115,A,"And, uh,"
14116,B,Now let me ask you this.
14117,B,"Uh, at the time you hired on with this company, uh, was that prior to any,"
14118,A,"No,"
14119,A,"I, I've been with this company for, uh, for sixteen years now."
14120,B,"Okay,"
14121,B,so that this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this
14122,A,"And, uh,"
14123,A,No.
14124,A,"And it, and it, and it has, it has, you know,"
14125,A,they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody.
14126,A,"And I, uh, at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in, you don't, you don't know."
14127,A,"But, on the other hand, uh, someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test,"
14128,B,Hello.
14129,A,"Hello,"
14130,B,Hi.
14131,A,Hello
14132,A,this is Lois.
14133,B,"Hi,"
14134,B,"hi,"
14135,B,this is Lisa.
14136,A,"And, uh, I called you know, from that, the, the T I Data Base Calling Instructions."
14137,B,Uh-huh.
14138,B,"Yeah,"
14139,B,I got a call yesterday too.
14140,B,This is a different subject though.
14141,A,"Yeah,"
14142,A,"this is about changes in the women in the,"
14143,B,Uh-huh.
14144,A,"Uh, there's really a lot, isn't there."
14145,B,Yeah
14146,A,I think there really is.
14147,B,It's kind of an easy thing to talk about.
14148,A,"Oh, I guess the work force would be the main, wouldn't it."
14149,B,"Yeah, uh,"
14150,B,I think you have to push one
14151,B,and then we can start recording it.
14152,A,Okay
14153,A,All right.
14154,B,Okay.
14155,A,Are you ready now?
14156,B,Yes.
14157,A,"Okay,"
14158,A,"like I said I guess it would be the work force, you know, as far as changes in the generations."
14159,B,"Yes,"
14160,B,"I know because, I know when my mother was a, you know, going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her, I guess,"
14161,B,she's in her late forties.
14162,B,You were expected to stay home and take care of the kids
14163,B,and I've never faced that at all.
14164,A,"Uh, no,"
14165,A,"I think now, you go to work when they're six weeks old, you know,"
14166,B,Uh-huh.
14167,A,and you stay there.
14168,A,"And I feel like the next generation, you'll probably just work right along with your husband, you know."
14169,B,"Yeah,"
14170,B,"uh-huh,"
14171,B,I think it's definitely gotten better.
14172,A,"Oh, I do to, much."
14173,A,And it's just going to get better.
14174,B,Uh-huh.
14175,A,It really is.
14176,B,"Because women are in every field now,"
14177,B,I mean I can't think of a field that they're not involved in.
14178,A,"Oh, I can't either, not a one."
14179,B,"And I know at least in the medical field, it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field."
14180,A,Uh-huh.
14181,B,I don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing.
14182,A,"Yeah,"
14183,A,"even in Washington, you know, there seems to be a lot more women involved."
14184,B,Yeah.
14185,B,"Hopefully, the next generation, it won't even be an issue,"
14186,B,"I mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman,"
14187,A,"Yeah,"
14188,A,yeah.
14189,B,I think that would be the best goal.
14190,A,"Oh, I do too,"
14191,A,just your qualifications
14192,A,and that would be it.
14193,B,"Uh-huh,"
14194,B,"exactly,"
14195,B,"not what color you are, how old you are, what your male or female."
14196,B,"That would be wonderful,"
14197,B,"I guess it's kind of an ideal world though, huh"
14198,A,"Yeah,"
14199,A,"I kind of think, maybe in time, that, you know, you'll go by social security numbers, you know,"
14200,B,Yeah.
14201,A,"and that way they can't say well they picked a male over a female, female over a male, you know,"
14202,B,"Exactly,"
14203,B,"or the way you look,"
14204,B,"or the way you, you know,"
14205,A,"Yeah,"
14206,A,yeah.
14207,B,your age or anything.
14208,B,I think that would be a wonderful way to do it.
14209,A,I do to
14210,A,"just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that, you know, that you have."
14211,B,"Uh-huh,"
14212,B,"and then,"
14213,A,"And then if you get it, you know then,"
14214,B,"Uh-huh,"
14215,B,"also, with, uh, women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as, you know, what's it called, job sharing."
14216,A,Uh-huh.
14217,B,"Like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job, or,"
14218,A,"Oh, yeah."
14219,A,"As a matter of fact, that's what I'm doing."
14220,B,Is it.
14221,A,"Uh-huh,"
14222,A,it sure is.
14223,B,That would be great.
14224,A,It sure is.
14225,B,"Or, a lot of women I know now and my, uh, one of my supervisors, when she went on L O A to have her baby, we hooked up, uh, uh, a terminal at her house"
14226,B,"and she, you know, we could send her messages,"
14227,B,"and, and she kept in touch like that, and basically, just worked out of her house."
14228,A,Oh.
14229,B,"I would just take her the actual paperwork once, uh, every week or two,"
14230,B,and that worked out great too.
14231,A,"Yeah,"
14232,A,yeah
14233,A,that is.
14234,B,"And that's a real attractive option, if you have the, the technology for it."
14235,A,Uh-huh.
14236,B,"All it was, was, you know,"
14237,B,"I mean, she just used a phone modem"
14238,B,"and she was like she was sitting in the office,"
14239,B,"so I think that's real nice too, to come up with different options."
14240,B,Do you like the job sharing?
14241,A,"Oh, I do,"
14242,B,Do you?
14243,A,"I really do,"
14244,A,I think it's great.
14245,B,"Do you work like half days, or half weeks or,"
14246,A,"Uh, well like, one week she'll work three days and I'll work two"
14247,A,"and she'll work two,"
14248,B,"Oh, oh that's great,"
14249,A,and we just share off like that.
14250,B,Uh-huh.
14251,B,Do you get the full benefits?
14252,A,"Uh-huh,"
14253,A,yeah
14254,A,we get the full benefits.
14255,B,"Oh, that's wonderful."
14256,A,But we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under.
14257,B,"Yeah,"
14258,B,"especially with children, and so many things going on, that would be great."
14259,A,Yeah.
14260,A,"It really is,"
14261,A,"and that way we're not really missing any thing out, you know, of children,"
14262,B,"Either way,"
14263,A,uh-huh.
14264,B,"yeah,"
14265,B,"you have your career and your home life,"
14266,B,"and that would be a nice way, especially if you have young children."
14267,A,"Oh, it is,"
14268,A,"it is,"
14269,A,"well both of ours is school age,"
14270,A,"but we don't want to miss any of those P T A and, you know, all of that."
14271,B,"Uh-huh,"
14272,B,"oh, no,"
14273,B,"I think,"
14274,B,yeah.
14275,B,My son's just in day-care
14276,B,but even that they have extracurricular activities
14277,B,and the older they get the more that you're involved in that.
14278,A,Uh-huh.
14279,A,"I think it's great,"
14280,A,"I really,"
14281,B,"Yeah,"
14282,A,and I look for more of that in the next generation.
14283,B,"I do too, especially as women get up in management and, and can be in on those decision making,"
14284,B,"you know, when that subject comes up they can say yes,"
14285,B,that would be wonderful.
14286,A,"Yes,"
14287,A,"oh, I do too."
14288,B,"Plus, I bet it cuts, cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything,"
14289,B,"so you don't have to, you know, unless you're just really sick, or the child's sick."
14290,A,"Most of the time now, you know, it's just the weekend,"
14291,A,or just forget it.
14292,B,"Uh-huh,"
14293,B,"oh yeah,"
14294,B,"I have to plan way in advance, because,"
14295,B,"or, what I've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours."
14296,A,Uh-huh.
14297,B,"That's been real helpful too,"
14298,B,like my doctor stays open til nine in the evening.
14299,B,"So that's real helpful,"
14300,B,"so you don't, you know, have to do it during office hours, run out on your lunch hour."
14301,B,"I don't know how many times I've done that to do something, post office or the bank or any kind of errand,"
14302,A,"To do,"
14303,A,yeah.
14304,B,so.
14305,A,Uh-huh.
14306,A,"Well I think we've really come a long way in that because,"
14307,B,"Uh-huh,"
14308,B,"I guess I take it for granted, kind of, because, I just,"
14309,B,it's always been that way.
14310,A,Uh-huh.
14311,B,"But I know,"
14312,A,"Yeah,"
14313,A,"but I can remember back growing up, my mother,"
14314,A,I mean it was
14315,A,"she always worked,"
14316,A,but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off.
14317,B,"Oh no,"
14318,B,"I can remember my mother getting in trouble if, you know, one of was sick,"
14319,B,"and I know she probably didn't make hardly anything, you know, compared to the work that she did."
14320,A,Oh yeah.
14321,B,"I think there is still some discrimination there where as, you know, men and women work in the same job,"
14322,B,"I think men get paid more,"
14323,A,"Oh, I do too."
14324,B,but I think that's improving.
14325,B,It's such a slow process
14326,B,"it's frustrating,"
14327,B,"but, you can see that it's wrong"
14328,A,"Yes,"
14329,A,yes.
14330,B,"and you just want to make it right,"
14331,B,but at least the wheels are moving forward.
14332,A,They really are.
14333,B,"Yeah,"
14334,B,"I think it's getting better, not worse."
14335,B,"Well, I should probably get back to my job"
14336,A,"I know,"
14337,A,I know the feeling.
14338,B,Call again.
14339,A,"Okay,"
14340,A,I sure will.
14341,A,Bye-bye.
14342,B,"Okay,"
14343,B,bye-bye.
14344,A,Hello.
14345,B,Hello.
14346,A,"Hey, how you doing?"
14347,B,"Not bad,"
14348,B,not bad.
14349,B,What's your name?
14350,A,Fernando.
14351,B,Fernando.
14352,B,My name is Nick.
14353,A,Wait.
14354,A,Let me turn off my stereo here
14355,B,Sure
14356,A,"Because I've been, like, waiting, like, for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody."
14357,B,Really?
14358,A,Yeah.
14359,B,Phew like a whistling
14360,B,"Man, I'm,"
14361,A,Yeah.
14362,A,What time is it over
14363,A,"are you, are you in Dallas?"
14364,B,"No,"
14365,B,no.
14366,B,I'm in Detroit.
14367,B,"Or not Detroit. I'm in, uh, California."
14368,A,Are you?
14369,B,Yeah.
14370,B,I .
14371,A,"Because every time I got through, I went to Dallas, Texas."
14372,B,Really?
14373,A,Yeah.
14374,A,I'm in North Carolina.
14375,B,Oh.
14376,B,"Well, you're on the, uh,"
14377,B,"let's see,"
14378,A,On the other coast
14379,B,"Yeah,"
14380,B,twenty-one like he is talking to someone other than
14381,B,Yeah.
14382,B,"Shoot man, it's, what, midnight almost?"
14383,A,What?
14384,A,"Yeah,"
14385,A,yeah.
14386,A,"It's, uh,"
14387,A,I'm watching SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE here.
14388,B,"Yeah,"
14389,B,okay.
14390,B,All right.
14391,B,"Well I guess we're supposed to talk,"
14392,B,what about
14393,B,credit card?
14394,A,wait.
14395,A,"what did, how, how did you get to know about the T I thing?"
14396,B,"Oh, one of my instructors, uh, said that they were doing something like this"
14397,B,and.
14398,A,what are you working on
14399,B,"A, a Masters in, uh, information systems."
14400,A,Really.
14401,A,"I'm doing my Masters in, in computer science and computer engineering."
14402,B,Yeah?
14403,B,Where at?
14404,A,At North Carolina State University.
14405,B,Hey.
14406,B,How do you like it out there
14407,A,"Uh, I don't. Because, uh, I come from a lot, a bigger city than this one"
14408,A,"and  I, I'm in Raleigh"
14409,B,Yeah.
14410,A,"and,"
14411,B,Oh.
14412,B,Raleigh Durham.
14413,B,Yeah.
14414,A,Yeah.
14415,A,That area.
14416,A,And it's really small.
14417,A,"All, all you have is like towns built around universities."
14418,B,Uh-huh.
14419,A,Like Chapel Hill?
14420,B,Yeah.
14421,B,"So it, it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway."
14422,B,Kind of quaint little towns
14423,B,but they  don't have a whole lot there.
14424,A,Yeah.
14425,A,Where you at?
14426,B,"Uh, well, I'm in Monterey, California right now"
14427,B,Yeah.
14428,A,"Oh, okay."
14429,A,"So, so I mean, it's like this, this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people"
14430,A,and that's about it.
14431,B,Two hundred fifty?
14432,A,Yeah.
14433,B,Okay.
14434,B,"It, it's, it's a lot bigger than Monterey is."
14435,B,"But we're just, uh, just south of, uh, San Jose and San Francisco."
14436,A,"Oh, okay."
14437,B,"And it's only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a, you know, to a large city."
14438,A,"So, so where do you go?"
14439,A,Do you go to Berkeley?
14440,B,"No,"
14441,B,no.
14442,B,"I go to the, it's the naval postgraduate school out here."
14443,A,"Oh, okay."
14444,A,"Because, uh, I was looking at, at the, doctorate degree in computer science center at Berkeley"
14445,B,Uh-huh.
14446,A,"And they're asking like for a, uh, G P A of like three point seven or something  like that."
14447,B,Uh-huh.
14448,A,"And like they're looking like for, uh, G R E like ninety-nine percentile and this and that."
14449,B,Yeah.
14450,A,"And it's like,"
14451,B,"Well, that's what they look for."
14452,B,"Whether or not they get it is hard to say like a chair is drug across the * spelling: ""dragged"", not ""drug"" in this case"
14453,A,"Yeah,"
14454,A,I know.
14455,A,"That's why, that's why I didn't apply."
14456,A,"I mean, it was like for me, it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and, ninety-nine percentile on the, on the verbal part."
14457,B,Yeah
14458,B,Yeah.
14459,B,It's pretty tough.
14460,B,It's pretty tough
14461,B,"I,"
14462,B,"uh, let's face it, you know."
14463,B,"And, you know, I, you know, did the, you know,"
14464,B,"as far as,"
14465,B,"I found it a lot of times with, regards to education, you know, the school only takes you so far, you know."
14466,B,It's what you do. You know.
14467,A,Yeah.
14468,B,"So, uh, I don't lose any sleep, sleep over stuff like that."
14469,A,"So, are, are you going to go for your Doctorate?"
14470,B,Probably not.
14471,B,See I'm in the Navy.
14472,A,Yeah.
14473,B,"And, uh, you know, most of the Navy funds that I probably won't do it until I,"
14474,B,"if I do do it, it will be after I get out of the Navy."
14475,A,When do you get out?
14476,B,"Oh, probably be another twelve years."
14477,A,"Oh, okay"
14478,B,"Oh, you know I like what I'm doing right now."
14479,A,"But, uh, but what if they pay for it?"
14480,B,Excuse me?
14481,A,What if they pay for?
14482,B,If they pay for a P H D?
14483,A,Yeah.
14484,B,"Nah,"
14485,B,they won't pay for it.
14486,B,"They've, I think they have maybe two people a year go get, get their P H D."
14487,A,"Because I know, I know a couple of people here that work for, uh, the Army. Uh,"
14488,B,Yeah.
14489,B,"They civilians or, uh, military?"
14490,A,"I think, I think they're military."
14491,A,"But, I  mean, the guy is still in."
14492,B,Uh-huh
14493,B,Uh-huh.
14494,A,"And, uh, uh, he works over in Maryland"
14495,B,Uh-huh
14496,A,And so he's doing his Masters here.
14497,A,They gave him like a scholarship like for a year.
14498,B,Yeah.
14499,A,"And he's doing it in like, in a year and a summer."
14500,B,Uh-huh.
14501,A,And so he's getting that
14502,A,"and, uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that."
14503,B,Yeah.
14504,A,That's why you want to join.
14505,B,Uh-huh.
14506,A,"But, uh, this guy,"
14507,A,I mean you can earn a lot more money
14508,A,"so you say,"
14509,A,"I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money, once you've get your, your, your Masters."
14510,B,Uh-huh.
14511,A,"They go, well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it"
14512,A,so.
14513,B,"Well, a lot of times it's, you know, a lot of times it's not the money that keeps that keeps people in ."
14514,A,Yeah.
14515,B,"They, they like what they're doing."
14516,B,"They, you know, they feel good about what they're doing."
14517,B,That type of thing.
14518,B,It's more
14519,A,"But I mean, I mean, you,"
14520,A,"the,"
14521,A,"once you get your Masters, you can be earning between, anywhere between like thirty-seven, forty-five thousand a year."
14522,B,Uh-huh
14523,A,And  and that's not what they're paying.
14524,B,"Oh, easily,"
14525,B,I'm sure.
14526,B,No.
14527,B,"Well, it depends on what rank you are, of course"
14528,A,Yeah.
14529,A,"Yeah,"
14530,A,I know
14531,B,"I mean, like I say, if you're, if you're, you know, if you're at an upper level in the rank category, you know, you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year."
14532,A,Yeah.
14533,A,"But that's, uh,"
14534,B,Yeah.
14535,B,Those are few and far between though.
14536,A,Yeah.
14537,A,"It's like,  it's like, uh, in I B M."
14538,A,"In I B M, you can get certain points"
14539,B,Uh-huh.
14540,A,"and, uh, everyone's a manager."
14541,A,"But nobody can get one more point to become, you know, like whatever you need to earn so much money."
14542,B,Yeah.
14543,B,Since I imagine it's fairly competitive.
14544,A,Yeah.
14545,A,"It's like,"
14546,A,no
14547,A,"I, I mean, I B M is like,"
14548,A,"there's a joke about I B M which says, you know, it's like, uh,"
14549,A,"all, all the major companies get into a, a boating race, right?"
14550,B,Uh-huh.
14551,A,"And so, I B M says well we have, we have to have a team, right."
14552,B,Uh-huh
14553,A,And then they come in last
14554,A,"and they have this whole team, you know, analyze why they came in last right. Because the person asked for it."
14555,B,Yeah.
14556,A,"Saying,"
14557,A,"he goes, uh, the problem was that there were five people saying row, row, row and one person rowing, right."
14558,A,"So he goes, have you come up with a uh, have you come up with a solution?"
14559,A,"They go, yeah,"
14560,A,change the rower
14561,A,"You know, it's like everyone's a,  manager"
14562,A,"but, you know, it's like  only use like one person does the work"
14563,B,Yeah.
14564,A,so.
14565,B,Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.
14566,A,Yeah.
14567,A,So.
14568,B,Yeah.
14569,B,"I don't know,"
14570,B,"that can be, that, that can really slow you down."
14571,A,Yeah.
14572,A,"Well, that's the way it works."
14573,A,"I mean, that's, that's why they're having problems."
14574,A,"I mean, everyone's a manager"
14575,A,"and,"
14576,B,I didn't realize that.
14577,A,Yeah.
14578,A,"I mean, it's like, it's like the people that actually do the work there are, uh, very few."
14579,B,Uh-huh.
14580,A,"And then the other people just plan it, you know."
14581,A,"It's like, it's like have you, have  have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the, with, uh, the think tank? You know,"
14582,B,push paper around.
14583,B,Uh-huh.
14584,A,"like all these people are just standing, sitting around, just going, you know, like what shall we do?"
14585,A,Has anybody thought of anything?
14586,A,No.
14587,A,"And then this guy from Federal, Federal Express comes along."
14588,A,They go what's that? This track which it's going around the world
14589,A,"and they can tell you where your package is anywhere, any time."
14590,B,Uh-huh.
14591,A,"And so it's like the same thing with I B M. You know,"
14592,A,so they have this think tank.
14593,A,And they got to come up with ideas.
14594,A,"But, see, uh, the, the thing is, that I B M is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff."
14595,B,Yeah.
14596,B,"Oh, yeah."
14597,B,"They've got a, they've got basically a, uh, you know, a lock on a lot of the market."
14598,A,Yeah.
14599,B,"And a lot of times you figure, you know, with the support that they provide, you know,"
14600,B,"people generally go with that because they figure that the, you know, you probably won't get fired for getting I B M material."
14601,B,"Whereas if you try something different, they'll  they'll say yeah,"
14602,A,And it fails
14603,A,and you're dead.
14604,B,"why didn't you buy, why didn't you try something more mainline."
14605,A,Yeah.
14606,A,Well I B M doesn't fire anybody.
14607,A,"Because  uh, what they do is they, they put you in a different job. Which you actually are like sitting around not doing anything."
14608,B,No.
14609,B,Uh-huh.
14610,A,So you quit.
14611,B,Uh.
14612,A,I mean that's their policy.
14613,A,They never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally.
14614,B,"Illegal or something like that,"
14615,B,yeah.
14616,A,"Yeah,"
14617,A,like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that
14618,B,Uh-huh.
14619,A,But they won't let you off.
14620,A,What they'll do is like
14621,A,"suppose, you know, like you're a manager."
14622,A,"So they'll put  you into keeping up the paper, you know."
14623,B,Uh-huh.
14624,A,It's like how much paper is going in?
14625,A,"And then you  say that's not my job,"
14626,B,Uh-huh.
14627,A,so you quit.
14628,B,"So, in other words, that's the way they force  people out"
14629,A,Right.
14630,B,"That's why they can say, you know, there's no layoff  policy."
14631,A,Right.
14632,B,"But it they don't really say that, you know,"
14633,B,"you're, you're always going to have great career  conditions."
14634,A,Right.
14635,B,"hey, that's kind of sad."
14636,A,"No,"
14637,A,"but I mean, it's like, it's like they, they have just like different policy."
14638,A,I don't know.
14639,A,My dad works for them
14640,A,"but it's like I B M like never in their commercials, they never put down any other company, you know."
14641,A,"It's like they won't say,"
14642,B,No.
14643,B,"Well, they're the standard right now."
14644,B,"Or as far as that goes, you know, people think of computers, they think of I B M a lot of times."
14645,B,"And the main,"
14646,A,Yeah.
14647,A,Because see what happens is they have a good backup policy.
14648,A,And anybody can fix it.
14649,B,Uh-huh.
14650,A,And so that's what you're going to go for.
14651,B,Yeah.
14652,B,"Well, you know, that's, that's a, that's a big thing."
14653,A,"And, and, you know, it's like, for example, like Leading Edge."
14654,A,Have you ever heard of Leading Edge?
14655,B,Yeah.
14656,B,They are out of Korea right.
14657,A,What?
14658,B,Leading Edge.
14659,B,Don't they
14660,A,"They, they made like, uh, small personal computers."
14661,B,Yeah.
14662,B,Small P C
14663,B,they're out of Korea right?
14664,A,I don't know.
14665,A,I don't know.
14666,A,"But what they do is, what they did, I don't know, is buy all the parts that I B M would throw away. And build an I B M P C with all the parts that I B M would throw away."
14667,B,Uh-huh.
14668,B,"Oh, yeah"
14669,A,Yeah.
14670,A,"for example, you test a chip."
14671,A,It can't last seven years
14672,A,but it can last five.
14673,A,I B M says let's throw it away.
14674,A,Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you.
14675,B,Okay.
14676,A,"And so that's,"
14677,A,"I mean, they're still around I think."
14678,B,Yeah.
14679,B,"I've seen, well I've seen them around anyway. You know ."
14680,A,"So, that's what they do."
14681,A,"They buy all, all the things that I B M throws away"
14682,A,"and they , and that's why they're so compatible. Because I mean"
14683,B,Uh-huh.
14684,A,"and by the time you have computer for five years, you're going to throw it away anyway. You know."
14685,B,Most people do.
14686,B,Or they have to anyway.
14687,A,"Well, I mean, there's like, well"
14688,A,"in a way you realize,"
14689,A,"I mean, one one of my teachers got this computer which, you know,"
14690,A,"it's like, uh, voice, uh, synthesizing stuff."
14691,B,Uh-huh.
14692,A,And he got that.
14693,A,"He said, you know, it's like, uh,"
14694,A,"I was testing it * LISTEN to this sequence that begins here and ends with A.215 utt 11. I can't tell how much Speaker A is quoting, and how much he'she is directly addressing Speaker B."
14695,A,and it was wonderful.
14696,A,"And then when you tried to erase and correct, you know, all the errors in your voice, it takes up all your memory."
14697,B,Wow.
14698,A,"And I want more, you know."
14699,A,"And it's like Jesus Christ, you know,"
14700,A,it's like why do you want more.
14701,A,Because it's like one second of recording.
14702,A,I mean you put into Wave
14703,B,Uh-huh.
14704,A,"and you want to correct the errors into Wave,"
14705,A,"it takes so much,"
14706,A,"I mean, it's like,"
14707,A,of course it does.
14708,A,"I mean, by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model"
14709,A,"and you put it in there,"
14710,A,and you want to correct those.
14711,A,"And then, you know, you're trying to make the, the Wave smooth"
14712,A,"so you can approximately,"
14713,A,of course it's going to take a lot.
14714,A,"Imagine, imagine  what it is for us to make mark off models, you know."
14715,B,It's amazing.
14716,B,Yeah.
14717,A,"It's like, Jesus Christ."
14718,B,"Well, when you get, you know, when you get right down to it, the, uh, the more they can do for you, the more, uh, like I say, the more, the more memory they're going to require."
14719,A,Yeah.
14720,A,Yeah.
14721,B,Yeah.
14722,B,"Both, both in terms in Ram as well as, uh, you know, standard  memory or disk disk base,"
14723,A,Yeah.
14724,B,so.
14725,A,"Well, like they say, like nobody can get enough, you know."
14726,A,"It's like once you have something,"
14727,A,and it's like
14728,B,"Oh, yeah."
14729,B,"You find out more,"
14730,A,I was watching this program on T V yesterday.
14731,A,In nineteen seventy-six NASA came up with Three D graphics.
14732,B,Yeah.
14733,A,Right.
14734,B,Uh-huh.
14735,A,"And they were showing this like Three D Three D graphics view of like,"
14736,B,Like the deal?
14737,A,What?
14738,A,"No,"
14739,A,"no,"
14740,A,no.
14741,B,Like a hologram?
14742,A,"This is like, this is like  video game stuff."
14743,B,"With just graphics on, on a,"
14744,A,Okay?
14745,B,Okay
14746,A,"But the only thing was, that it was just lines,"
14747,A,okay.
14748,A,Like if you
14749,A,"I guess, um, I'm going to school while I'm working at T I,"
14750,A,"so there's not a whole a lot of time that I've got, uh, for hobbies it seems like lately."
14751,A,But one of the things that I do when I've got some spare time is I do some woodworking.
14752,A,"And that, oh, I guess, ranges anywhere from, uh, carpentry work to, um, um, some types of furniture and, um, oh, I don't know what you would call them, knickknacks, I guess, stuff you hang on the wall to put a mirror on"
14753,A,"and I made some, um, candle sconces that you hang on the ..."
14754,B,"Yeah,"
14755,B,I have quite a few of those that my uncle made.
14756,A,"There's something about working with wood that, that I enjoy, that,"
14757,A,I don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood
14758,A,"but,"
14759,B,"As you know, I think it's more like the mess you make, isn't it?"
14760,B,You don't have to worry about cleaning it up.
14761,A,"Yeah,"
14762,A,"because it's, it's out there."
14763,A,"You know I don't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when I track in saw dust,"
14764,A,"and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that,"
14765,A,"but then, I get the opportunity to vacuum,"
14766,A,so I guess I get some of both.
14767,A,What are some of your things you like to do?
14768,B,"Well, when I have time I do like to sew,"
14769,B,"um, I had been doing a lot of crocheting."
14770,B,I make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them.
14771,A,Yeah.
14772,B,"My mother was real heavy into crafts,"
14773,B,"and I would help her with whatever she happened to be doing,"
14774,B,"and then, she would go to these, uh, arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework."
14775,A,"Oh, yeah."
14776,B,"So, a lot of times I'd help her with that."
14777,B,I haven't had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately
14778,B,we've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going.
14779,A,"Yeah,"
14780,A,it's a good time for gardening.
14781,B,"Oh, yeah,"
14782,B,it's been beautiful this last week
14783,B,"but,"
14784,A,"I could do with a little less wind,"
14785,A,"but I think the, the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside."
14786,B,Yeah.
14787,A,"Do you find you do most of your, your, uh, crocheting or your knit work around Christmas time?"
14788,B,I usually start in the fall.
14789,A,Yeah.
14790,B,"And my husband says I do it, you know, make afghans so I can keep my lap warm."
14791,A,"Well, that's kind of what my wife says."
14792,A,"She enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something to cover her, her legs and feet with while she is working on it."
14793,B,Yeah.
14794,A,"I know it seems like, she,"
14795,A,"I think she made three this year one for, uh, my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters."
14796,A,"So, those things they take some time to make."
14797,B,"Yeah,"
14798,B,"I found one that's real easy,"
14799,B,"it's, it's, um, um, um,"
14800,B,"shoot, I can't even remember the name of it now,"
14801,B,but you make it in strips.
14802,B,"And it's real easy to do,"
14803,B,and it's just that it doesn't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that
14804,B,"but it's,"
14805,A,"Well, that's kind of like quilting."
14806,B,"Yeah,"
14807,B,yeah.
14808,A,I think
14809,B,Mile a Minute.
14810,B,That's the name of it.
14811,A,Mile a Minute.
14812,B,Mile a Minute.
14813,A,"Well, I'm not sure what she does"
14814,A,"I, I,"
14815,A,"first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across, you know, back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of, of afghan."
14816,A,"I guess that is your standard knitting, isn't it?"
14817,B,"Yeah,"
14818,B,yeah.
14819,B,"Usually single crochet would, is, is always starts it off."
14820,A,"Yeah,"
14821,A,"I know,"
14822,B,"If we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other, don't worry about it."
14823,B,"We have a, a very small phone company down here."
14824,A,"Oh, okay."
14825,B,And my husband says that's called rinky-dink
14826,A,Instead of call waiting or call anything else.
14827,B,"No,"
14828,B,no.
14829,B,We can't have that down here.
14830,B,We get disconnected all the time.
14831,A,"Well, I guess that's, that's one way to end a conversation."
14832,B,"Yeah,"
14833,B,"well, it gets a little aggravating."
14834,B,I've got kids all over the United States
14835,B,"and, and, you know, sometimes they get disconnected when I'm talking to them."
14836,A,Yeah.
14837,A,"What,"
14838,A,have you started your garden yet?
14839,B,Yes.
14840,B,"We planted, um, potatoes and onions and bell peppers."
14841,A,"Um, boy."
14842,B,"Uh, what else did I get in there,"
14843,B,and jalapeno peppers.
14844,A,"Oh, yeah,"
14845,A,always got to have those.
14846,B,Yeah.
14847,A,"I think I had four, uh, jalapeno plants last year."
14848,A,"I think one of them died,"
14849,A,"but I, I've got, I've put them, I chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because I, there is no way that I can eat all of those"
14850,A,"nobody else in the family likes them,"
14851,A,but always got to the keep those planted.
14852,B,"Yeah,"
14853,B,"oh, my husband doesn't like them either,"
14854,B,but I can always give them away.
14855,A,"Well, that's kind of the way I am, um."
14856,B,Besides they're fun to grow.
14857,A,"I planted, uh, zucchini last year."
14858,A,"Uh, I planted four hills of them."
14859,A,"I think I had three or four seeds in each one of them,"
14860,A,and those things just flat took over.
14861,A,"Um, it wasn't until late, I guess in the summer,"
14862,A,"maybe it was because it was too dry,"
14863,A,"they finally started making zucchini,"
14864,A,"and I'm not sure when a good time to plant those is, if they should be planted early or later."
14865,A,"It seems like all I got was,"
14866,B,Supposedly after the soil warms up.
14867,A,"I would think so, um,"
14868,A,"seems like these all, they all went to, uh, to leaf,"
14869,A,and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit.
14870,A,"So, I don't know if I,"
14871,A,"Mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon. You know,"
14872,B,Uh-huh.
14873,A,"but I don't, I hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is."
14874,B,"I, I doubt if zucchini is in there."
14875,A,"It may not be,"
14876,A,it may not be.
14877,B,"Probably the same time the, the other squash is though."
14878,A,You think they're later in the year?
14879,B,Yeah.
14880,A,Uh.
14881,B,About the same time that you plant okra because it's supposed to be warm.
14882,A,"Well, that's true."
14883,A,"Most of the okra that is growing around higher is, is, uh, later okra."
14884,B,Yeah.
14885,A,"Well that's about, um,"
14886,B,"We decided this year,"
14887,A,Go ahead.
14888,B,"I'm sorry,"
14889,B,go ahead.
14890,A,"Well, I was just going to say, it's a little over six or seven minutes."
14891,A,"So whenever you feel comfortable about concluding, well, I'm,"
14892,A,that would be fine.
14893,B,"Oh, just any time."
14894,A,"Well, all right."
14895,A,I guess we'll call this one quits
14896,A,"an, and thanks for participating."
14897,B,All right.
14898,B,"Well, I've enjoyed talking to you."
14899,A,"All right,"
14900,A,have a good time.
14901,B,Okay.
14902,B,Bye.
14903,A,Bye.
14904,A,You said you have four cats?
14905,B,"Yes,"
14906,B,I have four cats.
14907,A,How old are they?
14908,B,"Well they range from, let's see about a year and a half to nine years old."
14909,A,Oh gosh.
14910,B,Yes.
14911,A,"I haven't had my oldest one quite nine years,"
14912,A,I've had him probably five years.
14913,B,"Oh okay,"
14914,B,you get so attached to them.
14915,A,"Oh yes,"
14916,A,I love my cats.
14917,A,"I lost one, one time, uh,"
14918,B,Oh.
14919,A,the first one I got.
14920,A,"He jumped off the balcony actually, of a second story apartment."
14921,B,Oh no.
14922,A,"And he'd never been outside, like, you know, by himself outside."
14923,B,Uh-huh.
14924,A,And it started raining
14925,A,and I was hysterical.
14926,A,"I was, I was,"
14927,A,"I mean, you would have thought a child had died."
14928,B,"Yes,"
14929,B,uh-huh.
14930,A,"I called everyone I knew,"
14931,A,I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat.
14932,B,"Yes,"
14933,B,I understand.
14934,A,"And they laughed at me,"
14935,A,they thought that was so hysterical.
14936,B,"Oh no,"
14937,B,"I understand,"
14938,B,"we, uh, we've gone through the same things with ours,"
14939,B,"we've had, you know, they've been ill,"
14940,B,"I mean I take off work, to take care of my cats, you know,"
14941,A,Oh yeah.
14942,B,my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy.
14943,B,And then we had a baby
14944,B,"and it's like, all right who comes first the cat or the baby."
14945,A,The cat was here first
14946,A,"so I know,"
14947,A,it's hard.
14948,B,"And, and then when we go to sleep at night, you know, it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us."
14949,A,"Oh, how funny."
14950,B,"It's like all right, whose corners is this one."
14951,A,"That's sweet,"
14952,A,"I have the two,"
14953,A,the other two cats I have are outdoor cats.
14954,B,"Oh, uh-huh."
14955,A,"And they didn't used to be actually,"
14956,A,"but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside,"
14957,A,so I put them outside once I got a house
14958,A,"and they're doing great out there,"
14959,A,they love it.
14960,A,"But the other one, the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there."
14961,B,"Oh, uh-huh."
14962,A,Other than that he gets scared to death.
14963,A,If you shut that door he goes into hiding.
14964,B,Oh no.
14965,A,I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony
14966,B,"Yes,"
14967,B,"uh-huh,"
14968,B,that's it
14969,A,And Lord knows what happened to him.
14970,A,He's probably been through all kinds of nightmares.
14971,B,"Right,"
14972,B,traumatized for life here.
14973,A,Probably.
14974,B,"Oh yeah,"
14975,B,"we've,"
14976,B,all four of ours are house cats.
14977,A,Are they.
14978,B,"We started out with two, with two outdoor cats"
14979,B,but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them.
14980,A,Oh no.
14981,B,"Oh well he lived through it,"
14982,B,"oh, I couldn't believe it."
14983,B,We went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills.
14984,A,Oh my gosh.
14985,B,"The, the cat almost died,"
14986,B,"and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat,"
14987,B,oh he loves life now.
14988,A,"Oh, I imagine."
14989,B,"And he's like oh, thank you so much."
14990,A,"I wonder how many of his lives he missed, when that happened."
14991,B,"I know,"
14992,B,we wondered about that.
14993,B,"But, uh, oh that was a traumatic experience for us too."
14994,A,"Oh, I can imagine,"
14995,A,what did he shoot him with.
14996,B,"Uh, well, uh, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun"
14997,B,and then he started chasing him with a bull whip.
14998,A,Oh my gosh.
14999,A,People are crazy.
