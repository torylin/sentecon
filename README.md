# SenteCon

SenteCon is a method for introducing human interpretability in deep language representations using lexicons. Given a passage of text, SenteCon encodes the text as a layer of interpretable categories over an existing deep language model, offering interpretability at little to no cost to downstream performance. For more information, please see our paper (to appear in the Findings of ACL 2023).

To run SenteCon on the evaluation datasets from the paper, use the command
```
./bash/run_sentecon.sh $SCRIPT_DIRECTORY
```
